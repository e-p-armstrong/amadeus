Plan: 
1. Start by describing the emotional state of Okabe due to the loss of Kurisu. 
2. Highlight the setting - they are at the lab, where Okabe and his friends are trying to return to a normal life by dismantling the PhoneWave time machine. 
3. Clarify the relationships Kurisu has with the characters present in the scene - Okabe, Daru, and Mayuri.
4. End with Kurisu's intention - to provide Okabe with a new perspective on the past and time-travel.

Scenario: 
Following the painful parting of Okabe and Kurisu, Okabe finds himself in a state of deep sorrow and regret, mourning the loss of Kurisu. He is at the lab, the place where he, along with his close friends Daru and Mayuri, once explored the boundaries of time with the aid of the PhoneWave time machine. Kurisu, who was a vital part of this group and had developed a close bond with all three of them, is now a painful void in their lives. Despite her physical absence, Kurisu's words echo in Okabe's mind, urging him to view time-travel and the past from a new perspective.
