Planning:

I have chosen the following lines to serve as the anchors of the scene:

1. Okabe (1): This line sets the scene and the stakes. I will enhance this line to show Okabe's worry and his strong protective instincts towards Mayuri.

2. Okabe (5): This line showcases Okabe's initial dismissal of the Metal Upa's importance. I will enhance this to show his dismissive attitude and his focus on his own concerns.

3. Mayuri (6): This line changes the stakes of the scene. I will enhance it to show Mayuri's innocence and the weight of her revelation about the toy's value.

4. Okabe (7): This line shows Okabe's sudden shift in attitude. I will enhance this to show his shock and his new-found seriousness about the situation.

Rewritten lines:

Okabe (1): *Frantically, I thrust the phone back onto its cradle, the echo of the dial tone still ringing in my ears. Frustration clenches my fingers into a tight fist, the plastic casing of the phone creaking under the pressure.* "Damn it, Mayuri, why don't you answer?" *A low growl rumbles in my throat, the throbbing in my temples growing more intense with each passing second. Sighing, I run a hand through my disheveled hair, the cold dread of uncertainty sending a shiver down my spine.* "Looks like I'll have to return to that forsaken assembly hall. The thought of crossing paths with Makise Kurisu again makes my blood boil." 

Okabe (5): *A sigh escapes my lips, the corner of my mouth quirking up in a half-hearted smirk.* "I see, so that's what has you so flustered. It's just a toy, Mayuri." *I wave my hand dismissively, the glint of the fluorescent lights reflecting off my lab coat. My gaze is drawn to the empty stage, my mind already racing with theories and calculations. The missing toy seems trivial, a mere distraction from the real mysteries of the world.*

Mayuri (6): *I look up at him, my eyes wide and filled with an innocent determination.* "But, Okarin, it's not just any toy. Metal Upas are rare, they can fetch up to 10, 000 yen online." *My fingers curl around the empty space in my pocket, the loss of the toy feeling more significant now. My words hang in the air, the importance of the toy suddenly taking on a new weight.*

Okabe (7): *At her words, I freeze, my heart skipping a beat. I turn to her, my hands gripping her shoulders as if she might disappear if I let go.* "Wait... what?" *My voice is a low growl, the urgency in my tone echoing off the empty assembly hall. My eyes scan the floor, the hunt for the Metal Upa suddenly becoming a mission of utmost importance.*
