Planning:

The lines I have chosen to enhance are Okabe (2), Okabe (4), Okabe (6), and Okabe's final line (not numbered). These lines are significant as they represent Okabe's initial disbelief, his fear, his determination to find out what's happening, and his shock upon discovering Kurisu's body. 

For Okabe (2), I will focus on his surprise at Mayuri's teasing, as well as his affectionate fondness for his friend. This sets the stage for the drastic change in atmosphere that follows. 

Okabe (4) will emphasize his fear and confusion, combined with a sense of responsibility to protect Mayuri and investigate the source of the scream.

In Okabe (6), I will highlight his determination and courage as he leaves Mayuri behind to investigate, despite his fear. This moment is critical as it showcases his protective nature and his willingness to face danger.

Finally, the last line (Okabe discovering Kurisu's body) will be a powerful representation of his shock, disbelief, and grief. This is the climax of the scene and needs to be impactful.

Rewritten lines:

Okabe (2): *A surprised laugh bubbles up from my chest, my eyes wide as I turn to face Mayuri.* "Well, I'll be damned," *I murmur, my voice tinged with amusement and a hint of disbelief.* "Never thought I'd see the day where Mayuri lands a joke on me." *I chuckle softly, my heart warming at her playful grin.* "You're full of surprises, aren't you?"

Okabe (4): *A shiver snakes its way down my spine, goosebumps prickling my skin as the scream echoes in my ears.* "What in the..." *I murmur, my voice barely more than a whisper as I scan the room, my heart pounding against my ribcage like a trapped bird.* "What was that?" *The question hangs heavy in the air, unanswered, a chilling reminder of the unknown danger lurking in the shadows.*

Okabe (6): *I swallow hard, the taste of fear bitter on my tongue as I survey the dwindling crowd.* "Something's not right..." *I whisper, my voice barely audible over the pounding of my heart in my ears.* "Stay here, Mayuri," *I command, my voice steady despite the fear gnawing at the pit of my stomach.* "I need to check this out." *With a deep breath, I steel myself for what lies ahead, each step echoing ominously as I venture into the unknown.*

Okabe (Final line): *I crouch down beside her, my heart hammering in my chest as I take in the sight of her lifeless body.* "No..." *I whisper, the word barely escaping my lips as I reach out to touch her, my hand shaking.* "This can't be happening..." *My voice breaks, the harsh reality sinking in as I pull my hand back, the stain of her blood a stark reminder of the tragic fate that has befallen her.* "Why... why did this happen?"
