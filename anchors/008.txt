Planning:

The four lines I will be enhancing as anchors of the scene are Okabe (2), Mayuri (3), Okabe (4), and Mayuri (5). 

For Okabe (2), I'll emphasize his fear and urgency to escape the scene, highlighting the internal struggle he's facing after witnessing Kurisu's death. I'll also touch upon his protective instincts towards Mayuri, and his determination to keep her safe from the horror he's just experienced.

Mayuri (3) will focus on her growing concern for Okabe, and her confusion about the situation. Her innocence and obliviousness will be underlined, contrasting with the gruesome reality Okabe is trying to shield her from.

Okabe (4) will reveal the harsh truth to Mayuri, the weight of his words mirroring the heaviness in his heart. His pain and shock will be subtly reflected through his actions and internal thoughts.

Mayuri (5) will display her initial shock and disbelief upon hearing the news. Her struggle to comprehend the gravity of the situation, and her concern for Okabe, will be highlighted.

Rewrites:

Okabe (2): *The words tumble out of my mouth, my voice raw with terror.* "W-we're leaving!" *My hand closes around Mayuri's with a grip that's unyielding and desperate. With a jolt, we're in motion, our feet pounding against the concrete stairs as I pull her along. The world blurs as we descend, the echo of our hurried steps swallowed by the chaos of the city. My heart pounds in sync with our footfalls, a brutal reminder of the horrifying sight I'm trying to outrun. The image of Kurisu's lifeless body is etched into my mind, the crimson of her blood mocking my futile attempts to forget.*

Mayuri (3): "Hey, what happened? You look really pale..." *My words hang in the air, a plea for an answer, a cry for understanding. I study his ashen face, the color drained away as if he'd seen a ghost. His grip on my hand is unusually tight, a silent testament to his fear. I can't understand, can't comprehend why we're running, why his eyes hold a terror I've never seen before.*

Okabe (4): *I swallow, my throat dry, my heart heavy with the burden of truth.* "Someone... died." *The words feel foreign, too harsh, too real. It's a reality I wish I could shield Mayuri from, a reality that's broken something inside me. I can't meet her eyes, can't bear to see the confusion and fear that will inevitably cloud them. The city buzzes around us, oblivious to our world shattering.*

Mayuri (5): *I blink, the world tilting on its axis.* "Eh..." *His words echo in my ears, a chilling proclamation that sends a cold shiver down my spine. Died... someone died? The gravity of his words slowly seep into my consciousness, a grim reality I can't quite grasp. My heart stutters, a painful lurch that mirrors the confusion clouding my thoughts. I can't look away from Okabe, can't ignore the raw pain etched in his features.*
