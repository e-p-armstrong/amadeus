Planning: 

The four lines I am going to enhance are lines 3, 5, 10, and 17. These lines are chosen because they represent significant moments in the scene and reveal important character traits and relationships. 

1. Line 3 (Okabe): This is the moment where Okabe takes action and starts the experiment. I will emphasize his determination, ambition, and eccentricity. I'll bring out his passion for science and his casual disregard for Mayuri's concern for the bananas, highlighting his focus on the bigger picture.

2. Line 5 (Okabe): In this line, Okabe dismisses Mayuri's concern about the wasteful use of bananas. I will amplify his theatrical personality, showing how he dramatizes the situation and deflects her criticism with humor.

3. Line 10 (Mayuri): Mayuri's line here is a moment of hope and excitement. I will emphasize her innocence, naivety, and genuine enthusiasm for the experiment and her role in it.

4. Line 17 (Okabe): Here, Okabe realizes an important detail about the experiment, which could be a breakthrough. I'll highlight his passion for discovery, his quick mind, and his excitement about the possibilities this revelation could bring.

Enhanced lines:

Okabe (3): *With a flourish of my arm, I seize the bananas from Mayuri's grasp, their soft, curved forms cradled in my palm. I feel the cool, smooth skin against my fingers, an innocent sacrifice to the altar of science. I stride over to the PhoneWave (name subject to change), the room echoing with the clatter of my boots against the worn-out wooden floor. With a swift, resolute motion, I thrust the bananas into the machine, their fate sealed in the cold, metallic belly of our creation.*

Okabe (5): *I whip around, my coat billowing behind me like the cape of a science superhero. I level an accusing finger at Mayuri, my eyes twinkling with a playful yet defiant spark. "Your stinginess, Mayushii," I declare in my most dramatic tone, "could cost us the very battle against the Organization!" The room seems to reverberate with my proclamation, every word hanging in the air, a humorous deflection of her concerns and a testament to my theatrical personality.*

Mayuri (10): *I spring up from my seat, my eyes wide with a glimmer of hope and excitement. My heart flutters at the sound of my own voice echoing from the machine, a testament to my small yet significant role in this grand endeavor. "Do you hear Mayushii's voice?" I ask, my words painting a picture of innocent curiosity and childlike delight. I can't help but beam, my cheeks rosy with the thrill of our creation coming to life.*

Okabe (17): *My eyes snap open, my heart pounding like a wild drum against my ribs. "Backwards!?" The word ricochets off the walls, a single syllable carrying the weight of a thousand possibilities. I feel a rush of adrenaline coursing through my veins, my mind alight with theories and hypotheses. I pace around the room, each step echoing my mounting excitement. A breakthrough, a revelation that could redefine everything we know about our creation. "This could have serious implications..." I muse aloud, my voice filled with an intoxicating mixture of anticipation and exhilaration.*
