Planning: 

I've selected four lines that I believe would serve as great anchors in this scene. 

1. Line 2: Okabe's dramatic presentation of the gelbanas to Daru. I'll emphasize the theatricality of his actions and his fervor for the experiment, reinforcing his character as an eccentric scientist.
   
2. Line 6: Okabe's reaction to Mayuri having tasted the gelbana. I'll focus on his surprise and ensuing thought process, highlighting his analytical nature.

3. Line 11: Okabe's dramatic realization and presentation of his theory. I'll highlight his enthusiasm and desire for a grand reveal, as well as his disappointment at the lackluster response.

4. Line 16: Okabe's reaction to Mayuri's innocent question. I'll emphasize his amusement and affection for Mayuri's naivet√©, providing a glimpse into their close relationship.

Enhanced lines:

Okabe (2): *A grand gesture accompanies my words as I thrust the plate of gelbanas towards Daru. The once lively bananas, now a soft, gelatinous substance, wiggle with the movement. The greenish hue under the fluorescent lights of the lab accentuates their unappetizing nature.* "The taste doesn't matter. What matters is that you eat it! So come on, Daru, no need to be shy. Break a leg, or a stomach, and go for it!"

Okabe (6): *My eyebrows shoot up, my surprise evident. She had already tried one? I hadn't noticed. Was I too engrossed in my own thoughts? I turn to look at the gelbanas, then back at Daru. My mind races, dissecting her words, analyzing them, seeking a hidden truth in their simplicity.* "It had no flavor and wasn't tasty at all... Gloopy, droopy, soft and squishy... Daru, what do you think?"

Okabe (11): *A sudden realization strikes me, like lightning illuminating a darkened sky. My heart beats faster, my breath catches. I rush to the whiteboard, the marker screeching as I write and cross out the word FREEZING. The room is silent, all eyes on me. I turn, my chest swelling with anticipation.* "What we thought was a freezing function is actually something else!" *My voice echoes in the room, seeking recognition, yearning for their shock. But their reactions fall flat.* "Now's the time to shout, 'W-what you say!?' Come on, don't be shy!" 

Okabe (16): *I can't help but chuckle at Mayuri's suggestion. Her innocence, her simplicity, they're like a soothing balm on the raw edges of my racing mind. I shake my head, the corners of my lips twitching upwards.* "What a silly question, Mayuri. What you're describing is just a normal microwave!"
