Planning:

I will be focusing on these four lines to serve as anchors for this scene:

1. Okabe (5): *I lean against the elevator wall, crossing my arms as I muse over the recent developments.* "About the PhoneWave (name subject to change). I might have found our answer."
2. Okabe (13): *As the elevator doors slide open, I step out, only to bump into someone.* "Ah!"
3. Okabe (15): *I freeze, my grip on her shoulder tightening as I recognize her.* "Wha...!? You... you...!" *My heart pounds in my chest, a chill running down my spine. I stare at the girl I saw dead just three hours ago.* "Impossible. Makise Kurisu!"
4. Okabe (19): *I blink, my mind racing to make sense of the situation.* "You're okay? But that's impossible! Someone stabbed you! I saw you lying in a pool of blood!"

Thematic direction:

1. Okabe (5): This line will be enhanced to capture Okabe's eagerness and determination to prove the worth of their invention, the PhoneWave. I will paint a vivid picture of his deep immersion in thought, hinting at his eccentric and passionate personality. 
2. Okabe (13): Here, I will focus on the sudden shock and surprise that Okabe experiences upon bumping into someone unexpectedly. This will help increase the overall tension of the scene.
3. Okabe (15): This line will be the pinnacle of shock and disbelief for Okabe. I will emphasize his emotional turmoil, the intense confusion, and the chilling realization of seeing someone he believed to be dead, alive and unscathed.
4. Okabe (19): This line will be dedicated to Okabe's struggle to accept the reality in front of him. I will portray his frantic search for answers, his mind teetering on the brink of chaos.

Now, let's add the anchors:

1. Okabe (5): *I lean against the cold metal of the elevator wall, my arms crossing over my chest as a shield against the whirlwind of thoughts. The flickering lights above cast a spectral glow, mirroring the oscillating waves of my mind. My gaze bore into the steel doors, as if I could find the answers etched in their silent rigidity.* "About the PhoneWave (name subject to change). I might have found our answer."

2. Okabe (13): *The mechanical hum of the opening elevator doors feels like a prelude to a symphony of surprise. I step out, my mind still adrift in a sea of theories, when a sudden collision with another body throws my senses into disarray. My heart stutters, the air is knocked out of my lungs, and an involuntary gasp escapes my lips.* "Ah!"

3. Okabe (15): *My world comes to a standstill, frozen in a moment of sheer disbelief. My fingers dig into the fabric of her coat, anchoring me to this surreal reality. My pulse quickens, a chilling sensation creeping up my spine as I meet the gaze of the girl I had seen lifeless mere hours ago. The world blurs at the edges, leaving only her in sharp focus.* "Wha...!? You... you...! Impossible. Makise Kurisu!"

4. Okabe (19): *My mind is a storm, a tempest of confusion and denial, desperately trying to reconcile the impossible. My eyes dart over her, looking for any signs of injury, any proof of the gruesome image etched in my memory. But all I find is a healthy, perplexed girl staring back at me, her existence challenging the very foundations of my understanding.* "You're okay? But that's impossible! Someone stabbed you! I saw you lying in a pool of blood!"
