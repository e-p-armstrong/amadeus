Planning:

I've chosen the following four lines as anchors based on their emotional weight, and the potential to delve deeper into the characters' emotions and the scene's atmosphere:

Okabe (1): This line sets the stage for Okabe's disbelief and confusion. I will emphasize his struggle to reconcile his memory of Kurisu's death with her current presence, making use of vivid imagery and metaphors.

Kurisu (2): This line is where Kurisu is defending her existence. I will depict her frustration and bafflement at Okabe's accusations, bringing out her determination to assert her reality.

Okabe (9): This line is a turning point where Okabe starts to accept Kurisu's existence. I will explore his shock and relief, and his desperate need for tangible proof of her existence.

Kurisu (16): This is the climax of Kurisu's exasperation. I will portray her anger and indignation, while subtly hinting at her confusion and fear in the face of Okabe's bizarre behavior.

Now, let's proceed with the rewriting:

Okabe (1): *A derisive laugh rips from my throat, a bitter sound that echoes in the lab's silence. My hand cuts through the air, dismissing the absurdity of the suggestion.* "I sent you an email? Absurd! Three hours ago, she lay lifeless, her form bathed in a crimson pool of betrayal!" 

Kurisu (2): *I cross my arms, my stance defiant, my brows furrowing as I level a glare at Okabe.* "Hey! Enough with your morbid fantasies! I'm here, alive and breathing. Can't you see?" *Each word is a strike, an attempt to shatter the delusion he's woven around me.*

Okabe (9): *My heart pounding in my chest, I reach out tentatively, my fingers brushing against her hair. It's soft, real, a tactile contradiction to the stark image etched in my mind.* "Substance... She has substance. She's flesh and bone, not some spectral illusion. How ludicrous of me."

Kurisu (16): *His hand on my blouse is the final straw, igniting a spark of fury that has been smoldering within me. I lash out, my hand colliding with his with a sharp slap.* "What truth, you cretin!? You dare to cross the line!? Do you have a death wish!?"
