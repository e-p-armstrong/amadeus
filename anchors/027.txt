(1) Luka: *I swallow hard, the lump in my throat threatening to choke me as I fight back the tears welling up in my eyes. My hands tremble, the oonusa shaking in my grip as I raise it high above my head, my heart pounding like a drum in my chest.* "Uuh..." *I muster all the courage I can, forcing the words out despite the fear wrapping around my voice like a vice.* "H-hear me, evil spirit!" *I plead, my voice barely above a whisper as I pour every ounce of my hope and determination into the ritual.* "Please leave from Okabe -- I mean Kyouma-san!"

(4) Okabe: *A sense of relief washes over me, extinguishing the uncomfortable tremor in my arm. I draw a deep breath, the air filling my lungs as if chasing away the last remnants of the strange ailment.* "...I'm okay. Looks like you drove away the evil spirit." *I say, my voice steady and warm, my eyes meeting Luka's with a grateful smile that dances at the corners of my mouth.* "Good job, Lukako."
