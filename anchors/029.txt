Enhanced Lines:

(1) Okabe: *I grip the phone with a white-knuckled intensity, my voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper that echoes through the dimly lit laboratory. The cold metal of the device seems to seep through my skin, chilling my bones with the gravity of the situation.* "It's me. Report."

(3) Okabe: *I push past his casual dismissal, my mind whirling with the implications of Titor's return. The words tumble from my mouth, heavy with unspoken questions and theories, each syllable echoing in the silence that follows.* "Are you aware that John Titor has returned?"

(6) Itaru: *I'm lounging in the plush café chair, my voice casual, a stark contrast to Okabe's intensity. The background chatter of the café and the soft jingle of a nearby arcade game fill the silence between us as I absentmindedly twirl a forkful of parfait.* "I'm at MayQueen+Nyan²."

(7) Okabe: *I sigh, shaking my head in disbelief, the weight of our situation pressing down on me. The harsh fluorescent lights of the lab flicker ominously overhead, casting long, dramatic shadows across the room. My voice hardens, becomes an unwavering command, as I attempt to reign in the chaos.* "Don't move until I get there."
