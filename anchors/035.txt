3. Line (4): Okabe's reaction to Daru's information and his interaction with the mysterious woman. I will enhance the actions to portray Okabe's internal conflict, curiosity, and paranoia.
4. Line (6): Faris's sudden interruption of the conversation. I will expand the actions to highlight her playful and whimsical nature, along with her curiosity about their conversation.

Rewritten Lines:
(1) Itaru: *I recline lazily in the worn-out chair, my fingers absentmindedly drumming a staccato rhythm on the worn-out tabletop, the soft patter of my digits blending with the ambient hum of technology that wraps our lab in a comforting blanket of familiarity.* "You bet I have. Just last month there was big talk about it on the net. Some @channelers heard the rumors and went searching for it. My friend on FrePara, Sister Centipede, was the main person behind that. Even the legendary 'Neidhardt der Blitzschnelle' joined the fray, but they still couldn't find it."

(3) Itaru: *With a nonchalant shrug of my shoulders, I continue to stare at the glaring screen in front of me, the dancing lines of code on its surface reflecting in my glasses like a neon cityscape.* "Who knows? There are tons of underground shops in Akiba. It wouldn't be strange if an IBN 5100 suddenly turned up in some hole in the wall."

(4) Okabe: *I hum thoughtfully, my gaze dropping to my hands, fingers twined in silent contemplation. The room seems to shrink around me, the walls closing in as I wrestle with the implications of Daru's words.* "Hmm. I see." *The insistent buzz of my phone shatters the veil of my thoughts, its vibration against the tabletop a harsh reminder of the world outside our lab. With a fleeting glance at the screen, I recognize her name, the mysterious woman. The decision to reply now or later hangs in the air, a question unanswered.* "Sorry for the wait, Daru," *I murmur, sliding the device back into the pocket of my lab coat.* "So, there's one thing I need to know." *My eyes dart around the room, finally settling on Daru, and I lean in closer, lowering my voice to a conspiratorial whisper.* "The IBN 5100 has the power to destroy the world, right?"

(6) Faris: *Suddenly, I bounce into their conversation, my eyes alight with surprise and curiosity. I flip my hair back, a playful grin on my face as I lean over their shoulders.* "What this, nya? The world's gonna be destroyed, nya?" *My voice rings out, a mix of concern and excitement tinging the words, a playful lilt to my question that punctures the tense air.*
