Enhanced lines:

(1) Faris: *I twirl towards the table, the plate of omelet rice cradled in one hand like a precious gem. The scent of the dish mingles with the café's homely aroma.* "Master, thanks for waiting nyan nyan♪ Omelet rice, nyan!" *I declare, my voice carrying the melody of a lively tune. I retrieve a bottle of ketchup from my apricot-colored apron, artfully scribbling 'THE WORLD IS DOOMED!!' on the omelet's sunny yellow surface. The ketchup trails my every move, painting a playful prophecy on the creamy canvas.* *I retreat, my hand resting on my hip, my eyes sparkling with satisfaction.* "Please enjoy your meal before the world ends♪"

(4) Faris: *I pivot towards Itaru, my head tilting with an air of inquisitiveness.* "Daru-nyan, Daru-nyan, have you considered participating in the Faris Cup, nya?" *My words hang in the air like an invitation, my eyes twinkling with anticipation. I can almost picture him, his fingers dancing over the controls, his face etched with concentration. The mere thought brings a smile to my lips.*

(10) Okabe: *I push the plate away, a heavy sigh slipping past my lips.* "No, I'm fine..." *I trail off, my gaze losing itself in the grains of rice. The cafe's chattering fades into a dull hum as memories flood my senses. I can almost hear the triumphant cheers, the clattering of game controls, the shared laughter that once filled the room.* "RaiNet AccessBattlers, huh... Whenever I hear that name, I remember the former champion... Has it already been two years? No, it's nothing. Forget what I said." *I brush off my thoughts like dust on an old photograph, not wanting to delve any deeper into the abyss of the past.*

(15) Faris: *I soften my gaze, my smile carrying a weight that belies my playful demeanor.* "I remember that you and the champion -- my brother -- were such good friends, Kyouma. You were so close it made me jealous, nya." *I let out a sigh, my heart heavy with longing and loss.* "But it's time to let go of the past! Seize the day with your own paws!" *I declare, my voice ringing through the café like a bold proclamation. I point at Okabe, my resolve as unwavering as the memory of my brother.* "Even though it's painful... no, because it's painful, I succeeded my brother's dying wish and purrfected my skills as a RaiNetter, nya! Do you remember, nya? He always used to say, 'Some day, let's bring peace to the world with RaiNet--'"
