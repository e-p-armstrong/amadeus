Planning/Brainstorming:

Given the playful and light-hearted nature of this scene, the characters' personalities are key to delivering the intended effect. 

1. Okabe Rintaro: The protagonist of Steins;Gate, Okabe is eccentric, paranoid, and has a flair for dramatics. He refers to himself as the "insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma" and often acts as if he's being pursued by an organization. However, beneath this facade, he cares deeply for his friends. His actions will be dramatic and exaggerated, with a sense of underlying fondness for his friends.

2. Faris: Faris is a cheerful and playful character who embraces the maid lifestyle. She is always seen with a smile on her face, and her actions are often accompanied by cat-like gestures and phrases. Her actions will be energetic, bubbly, and always in character.

3. Itaru (Daru): Daru is a laid-back, perverted, and tech-savvy character. He enjoys teasing Okabe and is often seen making light of situations. His actions will be casual, relaxed, and often humorous.

Based on their personalities, the following lines will serve as the anchors of the scene:

(2) Okabe: "I'm finished."
(5) Itaru: "Faris is one of the most skilled Rainetters I know."
(13) Itaru: "That doesn't matter at all! The point is, Faris is cute, and cuteness is justice. Cute cat-eared maids are sweet, if you know what I mean. And that's all that matters, right?"
(16) Okabe: "You're an inspiration, Daru."

Now, to rewrite these lines, adding depth, detail, and character-revealing actions.

Enhanced lines:

(2) Okabe: *I hold out the plate to Faris, my fingers drumming against its cool ceramic surface in a rhythm only I can hear. The plate is as empty as the streets I imagine in my mind, desolate and devoid of all but the remnants of my meal. My movements are swift and precise, a dance born of countless hours spent evading imaginary enemies. I dip my head in a nod of appreciation, my eyes dancing with the reflections of the café's lights as they flit from one corner to the other, ever vigilant, ever wary.* "I'm finished."

(5) Itaru: *I lean back, the worn-out cushion of the chair molding to my form, a testament to the countless hours spent in this very spot. My eyes trace Faris' path across the café, the admiration in my gaze as tangible as the warmth of the setting sun against the windowpane. The words slip from my lips, wrapped in a cloak of reverence, each syllable echoing the countless victories I've witnessed her achieve.* "Faris is one of the most skilled Rainetters I know."

(13) Itaru: *I laugh, my shoulders shaking with mirth, each chuckle resonating with the joy of the moment. I spread my hands wide, as if to encompass the whole of the café, my fingers dancing in the air as I paint a picture with my words. My gaze returns to Faris, her feline charm casting a spell on the room, her every movement a testament to the truth of my words.* "That doesn't matter at all! The point is, Faris is cute, and cuteness is justice. Cute cat-eared maids are sweet, if you know what I mean. And that's all that matters, right?"

(16) Okabe: *I laugh, the sound echoing through the café, a counterpoint to the usual hum of conversations and clinking dishware. My eyes crinkle at the corners, a genuine smile spreading across my face as I shake my head, my heart swelling with a fondness I seldom allow myself to feel. His words hang in the air between us, a testament to the bond we share, as I let out a soft chuckle of amusement.* "You're an inspiration, Daru."
