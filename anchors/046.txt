(7) Kurisu: *I cautiously approach the microwave, my eyes darting between it and the bananas. My mind races, trying to comprehend the incomprehensible.* "Huh? Oh... uh... A-at 104 seconds, it d-disappeared. Abruptly. Yeah."

(10) Okabe: *I step forward, my voice firm and my gaze unwavering.* "Don't avert your eyes from the truth! What you've seen with your own eyes is everything!"

(21) Okabe: *I watch her, my arms crossed and my mind a whirl of thoughts.* "Anything else? Have you noticed anything else about the PhoneWave?"

Enhanced lines:

(2) Okabe: *I brush aside Itaru's jest with a wave of my hand, my eyes searing into the innocuous bunch of bananas resting on the table. My heart pounds a relentless tattoo against my ribs, each beat echoing the cadence of anticipation. It's the thrill of the unknown, the allure of the impossible that sends an electric shiver down my spine, turning this mundane moment into a precipice of discovery.*

(7) Kurisu: *I inch towards the humming contraption, the microwave that had seemingly defied the laws of physics. My eyes flicker nervously between it and the now absent bananas. Thoughts, theories, and hypotheses whirl within my mind, a cyclone of knowledge struggling to grasp this enigma. An involuntary tremor in my voice betrays my disquiet.* "Huh? Oh... uh... A-at 104 seconds, it d-disappeared. Abruptly. Yeah."

(10) Okabe: *I stride forward, my voice resonating with a fervor that belies the surreal nature of our discovery. My gaze, unflinching and intense, implores her to believe in the incontrovertible evidence before her eyes. To surrender to the truth, no matter how unfathomable.* "Don't avert your eyes from the truth! What you've seen with your own eyes is everything!"

(21) Okabe: *I observe her, my arms folded across my chest, my mind a tempest of thoughts. The silence between us is punctuated by the hum of the lab equipment and her soft, contemplative murmurs. The spark of curiosity in her eyes mirrors my own, a silent testament to the shared intrigue that binds us in this moment of scientific revelation.* "Anything else? Have you noticed anything else about the PhoneWave?"
