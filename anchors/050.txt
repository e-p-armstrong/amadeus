Enhanced Lines:

(2) Okabe: *With a wild laugh bubbling up from my chest, I throw back my head, the sound echoing off the lab's cluttered walls.* "Heh... heh heh heh... MUHAHAHA!" *I proclaim, my voice ringing with triumph.* "Just as my calculations predicted!" *My hand reaches out to claim my phone, but it's still tethered to the PhoneWave. Resigned, I lean in close to the machine, whispering my catchphrase like a secret shared with the universe itself.*

(6) Kurisu: *I cut through the chatter with a swift wave of my hand, my voice rising in urgency.* "The chicken doesn't matter!" *I insist, my words sharp and quick.* "Right now, we need to determine what happened with the PhoneWave." *My mind races, a whirlwind of hypotheses and possibilities, each one a tantalizing glimpse of the unknown.*

(7) Mayuri: *I blink back the tears welling up in my eyes, my voice a soft whimper.* "It doesn't matter?" *My words hang in the air, heavy with hurt.* "That's so mean, uh, Christina-chan..." *I cradle the charred remains of my chicken, feeling a pang of loss for something more than just a meal.*

(10) Okabe: *I silence the room with a single, powerful slam of my hand on the table.* "Silence, all of you!" *Disconnecting my phone from the PhoneWave, I scroll through my emails, my breath hitching as I find what I've been looking for.* "Muhaha! Muhahaha! MUHAHAHAHA!" *I throw back my head, laughing maniacally at the ceiling, clutching my phone like a holy grail.* "It all connects. There's a meaning behind this series of events, and only one true answer. I've discovered the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s true hidden function! This isn't intuition. That's right. This is conviction!"
