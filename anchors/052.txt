Enhanced Lines:
(4) Okabe: *With a slight huff of frustration, I cross my arms over my chest, a dramatic sigh escaping my lips. The neon lights of the lab flicker overhead, casting long, dancing shadows across the room, mirroring the waltz of thoughts in my mind.* "Hmph. You're such a bum." *I meander over to Daru's fortress of screens, my curiosity piqued, my heart thudding in my chest like a drum echoing through the cavernous expanse of the unknown.*

(8) Okabe: *A sudden jolt of realization strikes me like a lightning bolt, searing through the fog of confusion. I whirl around, my heart pounding against my ribs like a desperate prisoner against cell bars. My eyes, wide as saucers, lock onto Daru, the words tumbling out of my mouth in a torrent of shock and disbelief.* "W-what!? What did you just say!?" *My mind is a whirlwind, a tempest of thoughts and questions swirling around in chaotic symphony.*

(20) Okabe: *A scoff escapes my lips, a bitter tune playing on the silent stage of the lab. The hypocrisy of it all, the sheer audacity, sparks a fire within me, a burning determination. The name 'SERN' echoes in my mind, a ghost from a past conversation.* "SERN..." *A rush of memories flood back, piecing together a jigsaw puzzle of information.* "John Titor!"

(26) Okabe: *A wave of determination washes over me, my gaze fixed on Daru, unwavering, undeterred. I brush off his comment, my mind whirring, processing, connecting dots in a vast constellation of information.* "It doesn't matter if it was ten years ago or ten seconds ago. That's not the point, Daru. This coincidence could very well be the choice of Steins Gate!" *With each word, I feel a surge of conviction, a resolution to unravel the mystery, no matter what it takes.*
