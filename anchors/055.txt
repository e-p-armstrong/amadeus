Enhanced Lines:

(1) Okabe: *My fingers dance across the keyboard, each tap a symphony of virtual confrontation. The luminous glow of the monitor bathing my face, the room around me blurs into insignificance. A faint creak draws my attention, tearing me away from the world within the screen. I look up, recognizing the intrusion of a familiar silhouette against the dim light.* "I recognize her. She's the girl I met yesterday at the Braun Tube Workshop."

(9) Okabe: *The words hang in the air, a cold breeze of realization sweeping across my face. My heart pounds like a war drum in my chest, its rhythm echoing my rising panic. I snap upright, the chair beneath me screeching in protest. Her revelation, whether intentional or not, has shattered my carefully constructed facade of calm.* "How did you know that!? I never told you. Wait, are you an Organization spy!?" *I square my shoulders, my body instinctively assuming a defensive stance, ready for an attack that may never come.*

(14) Suzuha: *Her eyes widen, reflecting the flickering light of the monitors. The world around her seems to fall into a hush, only her voice piercing the silence. There's an innocence in her question, a naive curiosity that belies the gravity of her words.* "Wow... Is the evil organization SERN?" *Her voice wavers, betraying a hint of awe and curiosity that tugs at the edge of my sanity.*

(19) Okabe: *My voice rises, each word a dagger of suspicion hurled at her. The room feels tighter, the walls closing in, mirroring the pressure building within me. My eyes bore into hers, desperate for answers, for an explanation that could quell the storm of disbelief raging in my mind.* "Just answer my question! How did you know about our business with SERN!?" *My demand echoes through the room, the silence that follows heavy with unspoken tension.*
