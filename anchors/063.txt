Lines chosen to enhance:

(4) Okabe: *I watch in silent admiration as Daru undoes the security in less than ten minutes, my mind working overtime to decipher the machine translation. Nice, super hacka. He's a genius, no doubt.*

(8) Okabe: *I freeze, the information sinking in. My heart pounds in my chest, my mind racing.* "...Nine years?"

(14) Okabe: *I gulp, the implications of the email sinking in. My mind races, piecing together the information.* "Keep looking, Daru. Search for anything related to time machine research."

(17) Itaru: *With a shrug, I turn back to the screen, my fingers flying over the keys once again.* "Hmm, there aren't any emails with the phrase 'time machine' in them... But the phrase 'Z Program' was used hundreds of times in the past few months. Do you think it could be about the current LHC experiments?"

(4) Okabe: *As I silently observe Itaru, my heart throbs in my chest, echoing the silent rhythm of the code that dances across the screen. The room is filled with the symphony of his keystrokes, each one a testament to his brilliance. I marvel at the ease with which he navigates the labyrinth of encrypted messages, his fingers dancing over the keys like a seasoned pianist. It's a spectacle that never fails to inspire awe. His genius is undeniable, a beacon in the murky depths of this digital sea. A sly smile graces my lips as I lean back in my chair, my mind racing to keep pace with the flow of translated text.*

(8) Okabe: *As the weight of the revelation descends upon me, my body grows rigid, my blood turning to ice in my veins. The room around me blurs as my mind grapples with the enormity of the information. Nine years... The words echo in my head, a haunting refrain that sends chills down my spine. The steady hum of the computer fans is the only sound that penetrates the deafening silence that follows. My heart pounds wildly against my rib cage, each beat a reminder of the precipice we stand upon.*

(14) Okabe: *I swallow hard, my throat tight as the implications of the email weave a tangled web in my mind. My hands tremble slightly as I run them through my hair, a vain attempt to ease the tension that has taken root. The air in the room feels heavy, laden with the gravity of our discovery. The world as we know it teeters on the edge of a revelation, the echoes of its potential reverberating through my being. I meet Itaru's gaze, my eyes burning with resolve.* "Keep looking, Daru. Search for anything related to time machine research."

(17) Itaru: *I tilt my head, a faint smirk playing on my lips as I turn my attention back to the glowing screen. The keys beneath my fingers feel cool and familiar, the rhythm of my typing a comforting constant in this sea of uncertainties. The buzz of the computer, the soft glow of the screen, the labyrinth of data - it's a world I know well, a world I navigate with practiced ease. I can't help but feel a thrill at the challenge, the allure of the unknown stoking the fires of my curiosity.* "Hmm, there aren't any emails with the phrase 'time machine' in them...
