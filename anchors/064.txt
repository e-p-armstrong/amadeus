**Character Personalities and Styles**

Okabe Rintaro: Okabe, also known as Hououin Kyouma, is a self-proclaimed "mad scientist" with a flair for the dramatic. He is driven by his thirst for truth and curiosity. He often speaks with a confident, theatrical tone and possesses a strong sense of determination. For Okabe, I'll use a style that reflects his eccentric personality, adding a touch of grandeur to his actions and thought processes.

Itaru "Daru" Hashida: Daru is a skilled hacker and a realist. He's the voice of reason in their adventures, always considering the potential dangers of their actions. However, he's also a loyal friend, following Okabe's lead despite his own concerns. For Daru, I'll use a more practical, straightforward style, highlighting his rational thinking and cautious approach.

**Enhanced Lines**

(3) Itaru: *I chuckle nervously, the sound hollow in the silent room. The cold glow of the computer screen illuminates my furrowed brow as I rub the back of my neck, a nervous tic betraying my unease.* "SERN's not even a government organization, so why? Wait, should we be looking at this stuff? We might be in a little deep here." *The words hang in the air, a chilling reminder of the precipice we're teetering on.*

(10) Okabe: *The world seems to slow down as I take in Daru's words. My heart pounds like a war drum in my chest, each beat echoing the gravity of our discovery. The room around me blurs, the edges of reality distorting as if pulled by the gravity of the revelation.* "Stop! Stooopp!" *I slam my fist on the table, the sound reverberating through the room. My voice is a mix of exhilaration and dread, a wild symphony of emotions.* "So SERN did use the LHC to generate mini black holes!"

(16) Okabe: *A shiver races down my spine, a frigid wave of dread that leaves me numb. My heart seems to plummet, a sinking stone in the sea of my disbelief.* "Wh-what does that mean?" *My voice is a bare whisper, the words slipping from my lips like ghostly specters of the horrifying truth.*

(21) Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, my smirk a thin veneer of humor over the skepticism that lingers in my eyes. My fingers pause over the keyboard, the keys cold and unyielding beneath my touch.* "You know we're not going to find anything, right?" *The words, laden with a mixture of sarcasm and resignation, hang in the tense air between us.*
