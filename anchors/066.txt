Enhanced lines:

(1) Okabe: *With every throb of my racing heart, my gaze remains locked onto the unchanging screen, the silence of the lab amplifying the ticking seconds into an unbearable crescendo. A breath escapes me in a rush as a new message materializes, my fingers trembling with the weight of anticipation as they reach out to open it.* "It's here!" *My voice shatters the silence, a victorious cry echoing within the confines of our sanctuary.* "Heh, heh heh heh... Just as I suspected."

(5) Okabe: *I nod, the realization dawning on me like the first light of a new day. The pieces of the puzzle click into place, forming a picture that sends a shiver of excitement coursing through me.* "It can also decipher IBN's proprietary programming language, which was written before APL and BASIC became widespread. Isn't that surprising? Now it's a dead programming language only decipherable with an IBN 5100." *A sardonic chuckle escapes me as I ponder the absurdity of it all.* "Heh heh heh. No... NO, I SAY!" *I rise, my voice reverberating with the weight of our discovery, my declaration echoing through the lab.* "This discovery of ours was inevitable from the start! For this is the choice of Steins Gate!!"

(15) Okabe: *I dismiss Mayuri's nonchalance with a wave of my hand, my determination undeterred. My eyes flash with an inner fire, my voice resounding with conviction and urgency.* "It doesn't matter whether you can hear or not! This meeting concerns the fate of the Future Gadget Laboratory -- nay, the fate of mankind! So I want it to feel more secretive, like we're scheming or something!"

(17) Okabe: *My words hang heavy in the air, their gravity anchoring us to our newfound purpose. I look at my companions, my gaze unwavering, my voice a beacon in the sea of uncertainty.* "Listen, you two!" *My declaration fills the room, a call to arms against the forces that lurk in the shadows.* "Henceforth, the Future Gadget Laboratory shall begin emergency top secret operations! This shall be the first stage in our war against the dark powers that manipulate the world from the shadows! Our enemy is SERN, a scientific institute engaged in the most evil research imaginable!"
