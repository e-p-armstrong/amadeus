- (21) Suzuha: "They've been dead for years."
- (35) Okabe: "I like the look in your eyes, you Part-Time Warrior. They shine with the radiance of the beast unseen in modern men. Never forget those eyes of yours, and you shall surely change class from Part-Time Warrior... to True Warrior."

Thematic Direction: The chosen lines will be amplified to reflect the tension and desperation in the scene, as well as the personal dynamics between the characters. There will be a focus on the characters' inner thoughts and feelings, as well as their reactions to each other's words.

Enhanced Anchor Lines:

(10) Okabe: *In a moment of shared silence, I lean in closer, my gaze piercing into hers like a laser cutting through steel. The world narrows down to just us two, and the question that has been burning in my mind, a question that carries the weight of our future.* "Where is the IBN 5100?"

(16) Okabe: *There's a fierceness that takes over me, a beast that refuses to back down in the face of adversity. I straighten my back, my eyes gleaming with an unyielding resolve that lights up the dim alleyway. The words escape from my lips like a battle cry, echoing off the walls around us.* "Then take me to them. I won't take no for an answer. Refuse, and I'll show you a living hell."

(21) Suzuha: *My voice drops to a whisper, barely audible over the distant hum of city life. There's a sadness that lurks in my eyes, a shadow of a past that's long since faded. The words hang heavy in the air, as if they carry the weight of the years and the silence of those who are no longer with us.* "They've been dead for years."

(35) Okabe: *Overwhelmed by a sudden surge of admiration, I reach out to grasp her hand, my voice brimming with sincerity. My words are a tribute to her resilience, a testament to the warrior spirit that blazes in her eyes. They're a promise, a vow, a challenge.* "I like the look in your eyes, you Part-Time Warrior. They shine with the radiance of the beast unseen in modern men. Never forget those eyes of yours, and you shall surely change class from Part-Time Warrior... to True Warrior."
