Writing:

(4) Okabe: *My heart drums a loud, relentless beat against my ribcage as I digest Mayuri's words, their implications spiraling through my mind like a whirlwind. A lead... a ray of hope cutting through the dense fog of uncertainty. My gaze hardens, determination steeling my resolve as I grip my phone, fingers tracing over the cool surface.* "Faris?" *I say, my voice a mere whisper in the silent room.* "It's me. Looks like we've got a lead on the IBN 5100. Are you ready for this? It's Faris NyanNyan. It turns out that catgirl's an expert on retro PCs. There's probably another side to this. Let's keep our eyes peeled. ...Hmph. I suppose I'm the only man for the job. Very well. I'll make the approach. If you don't hear from me by 2000 hours tonight, then forget about me and commence the strike on MayQueen. Everything is the choice of Steins Gate... El Psy Kongroo."

(5) Mayuri: *A gasp escapes my lips, my eyes widening like saucers at the sight of my dwindling chicken supply. Betrayal stings, a bitter taste in my mouth as I watch Okabe nonchalantly pop another piece into his mouth.* "Ahh! I didn't say you could have two!" *I exclaim, my voice echoing in the small room, a testament to my love for the succulent meat.*

(10) Okabe: *I pause, my gaze lingering on Mayuri for a moment longer than necessary. The gravity of the situation weighs heavily on my shoulders, a silent reminder of the danger that lurks in the shadows. With a deep breath, I steel myself, my voice steady as I issue my instructions.* "Well, whatever. I'm uneasy about the lack of intel, but the mission must go on. Wait here, Mayuri. If I don't return within the hour, go home immediately. Understood?"

(14) Faris: *A giggle bubbles up from my chest, my eyes sparkling with excitement as I explain the rules of the Faris Cup. I swish my tail, the bell jingling merrily with each movement, as I lean in closer, my voice dropping to a whisper.* "No, nya. It's a cat-eat-cat battle royale where the winner gets to make Faris his slave, nya. Ahh, no, you can't! You can't claw at each other's throats over Faris, nya! Please, stop nya!"
