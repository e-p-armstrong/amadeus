Brainstorming/Planning:

The four lines I plan to enhance are:

1. (1) Okabe: "Haah... haah... we made it..."
2. (4) Luka: "Since you're my master, Kyouma-san, I'm happy... to be of use to you."
3. (9) Kurisu: "Who're you calling an assistant? You wouldn't pick up your phone, so I've been waiting here an hour for you."
4. (15) Suzuha: "Wait... you got one?"

Okabe is a theatrical and eccentric character, so his actions should reflect a grandiosity and flair for the dramatic. Luka is shy and humble, so his actions will be timid and eager to please. Kurisu is intelligent and snarky, her actions should be tinged with sarcasm but also reveal her concern for Okabe. Suzuha is focused and straightforward, her actions will reflect her surprise and admiration for Okabe's achievement.

New Enhanced Lines:

1. (1) Okabe: *I pause, the weight of our journey pressing heavy on my shoulders, and the frigid night air catching in my lungs. The lab looms ahead, a beacon in the quiet darkness. Sweat trickles down my face, but a wild, triumphant grin tugs at my lips.* "Haah... haah... we made it..."

2. (4) Luka: *My gaze drifts to the ground, a blush creeping onto my cheeks. I twirl a lock of hair around my finger, the words tumbling out in a shy whisper that's barely audible above the evening's silence. The look of gratitude in Okabe's eyes fuels my resolve, my heart swelling with a quiet pride.* "Since you're my master, Kyouma-san, I'm happy... to be of use to you."

3. (9) Kurisu: *I lean against the window frame, my arms crossed and my brow furrowed in a blend of irritation and concern. My gaze is locked onto Okabe, a mix of curiosity and frustration swirling within me. I bite back a retort, choosing instead to voice my worry.* "Who're you calling an assistant? You wouldn't pick up your phone, so I've been waiting here an hour for you."

4. (15) Suzuha: *I peer into the box, my eyes widening in surprise as I take in the sight of the elusive IBN 5100. A rush of adrenaline courses through me, my heart pounding in my chest. A smile tugs at the corners of my lips, and I can't help but let out a breath of awe.* "Wait... you got one?"
