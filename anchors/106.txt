Enhanced Lines:

(1) Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, my eyes a pair of twin storms lost in the tempest of conspiracy theories brewing in my mind. The idea of the IBN 5100 being central to SERN's operations was an intricate knot that I was unraveling, each thread revealing a more sinister secret than the last. I let the theories wash over me, an exhilarating tide of uncertainty and intrigue. My fingers tap an erratic symphony against the tabletop, a reflection of the chaos within my thoughts.* "So maybe that's why the IBN 5100 was central to SERN's operations..."

(7) Kurisu: *My voice slices through the tension, reading the English text with an almost robotic precision. Each word is a hammer blow, chipping away at our ignorance, revealing a disturbing reality beneath. My fingers twitch against the desk, the only outward sign of my inner turmoil. I can feel the weight of the truth pressing down on us, a crushing force that threatens to shatter our world.* "...'SERN's purpose heading into the 21st Century shall be to establish control over space and time..."

(16) Kurisu: *I swallow hard, my voice barely a whisper as I read out the line. The words hang heavy in the air, a chilling proclamation of intent. My heart pounds in my chest, a frantic drumbeat echoing the shock coursing through my veins. My eyes are wide, reflecting the harsh glow of the computer screen, a stark contrast to the darkness of our discovery.* "'The purpose of the Z Program is to perform time-space displacement experiments by means of high-energy proton-proton collisions.'"

(18) Kurisu: *I sink back in the chair, my mind reeling from the sheer audacity of the deception. The reality of SERN's agenda was a bitter pill, a jagged piece of truth that scraped against my disbelief. My fingers curled around the edges of the chair, a lifeline in the whirlpool of shock threatening to pull me under. I stared at the screen, the words seared into my consciousness, a haunting echo of a world gone mad.* "No way... it was true? You're telling me they've been deceiving the world for nearly 40 years?"
