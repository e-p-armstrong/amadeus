Lines to be enhanced:
1. Okabe: *I rise from my chair, my body casting a long, foreboding shadow in the dim light of the lab. My arm shoots up, my index finger piercing the air as if challenging the gods themselves.* "Henceforth, this shall be known as Operation Laegjarn's Chest!"
2. Itaru: *My fingers, dexterous and practiced, dance across the keyboard, a symphony of clicks echoing in the lab. Code after code, I break through the labyrinth of digital walls, a smirk of satisfaction playing on my lips as the last barrier crumbles.* "Ready? I'm opening it."
3. Kurisu: *I lean in, my breath hitching as I catch sight of the report's chilling contents. My voice, usually steady and confident, wavers as I read, each word like a punch to the gut. The room seems to shrink with every syllable, the reality of our research closing in on us.* "'Jellyman's Report 10' 'Subject: James McCarthy, Age: 31, American' 'Z Program Stage 4, Date of Experiment: 2005-01-28 T13:05' 'Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.'"
4. Okabe: *My eyes, locked on the haunting image on the screen, refuse to blink, as if the blinking might make it disappear. The lab, our sanctuary of science, has never felt more oppressive. The ticking clock is a relentless reminder of the path we've chosen. I swallow hard, my heart hammering against my ribs, the taste of danger palpable on my tongue.*
