Planning:

The characters in this scene are Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru. Okabe is a mad-scientist type character who is eccentric and dramatic, Kurisu is a genius researcher who is serious and analytical, and Itaru is a skilled hacker who is laid-back and somewhat lazy.

1) Okabe (Line 9): He's struggling with the shocking revelations, torn between his desire to know more and his horror at the implications of their discovery. His actions will reflect his internal conflict. 

2) Kurisu (Line 12): She's acting as a translator and reporter, emotionally detaching herself from the disturbing content to provide information. I'll portray her as focused and meticulous, her actions and thoughts reflecting her determination to keep her emotions in check.

3) Itaru (Line 10): He's the one finding and presenting the reports. His actions will reveal his unease and concern, but also his dedication to uncovering the truth.

4) Okabe (Line 11): His reaction to the number of victims will show the weight of the situation sinking in, his horror and disgust growing. His actions and thoughts will reflect his shock and desperation.

Lines to be enhanced:

(9) Okabe: "Is this the only report?"

(12) Kurisu: "'Jellyman's Report 9.' 'Subject: Dan Strayski, Age: 26, Canadian.' 'Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2004-9-6 T 14:10.' 'Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.' The newspaper clipping... I think it's in French. I can't read it."

(10) Itaru: "No, there's more. Looks like... 14 people in total."

(11) Okabe: "More Jellymen? That means more gelified people... more victims of human experimentation..." "Show me the others."

Enhanced lines:

(9) Okabe: *I grit my teeth, my heart pounding in my chest like a war drum. Each beat echoes the horrifying implications of the report we've just discovered. My hands clench into fists, knuckles white against the dim light of the lab.* "Is this the only report?"

(12) Kurisu: *I force myself to remain detached, to treat each horrifying revelation as just another piece of data to be processed. My eyes skim over the words, my mind meticulously translating, categorizing, analyzing. The cold, clinical language of the report does nothing to lessen the horror of its contents.* "'Jellyman's Report 9.' 'Subject: Dan Strayski, Age: 26, Canadian.' 'Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2004-9-6 T 14:10.' 'Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.' The newspaper clipping... I think it's in French. I can't read it."

(10) Itaru: *I glance at the screen, my fingers hovering over the keyboard. Each click feels like a hammer blow, revealing another life lost, another horror committed. My stomach churns, but I force myself to continue, to uncover the truth no matter how monstrous it may be.* "No, there's more. Looks like... 14 people in total."

(11) Okabe: *The numbers hit me like a physical blow, the reality of our discovery sinking in. Fourteen lives lost, fourteen families torn apart. A cold dread fills me, a chilling echo of the gelified victims we've just discovered. My voice is hoarse, barely above a whisper as I force out the words.* "More Jellymen? That means more gelified people... more victims of human experimentation..." "Show me the others."
