Enhanced lines:
(3) Okabe: *I extend a shaky finger towards the screen, its glow casting an eerie pallor on my face. Each pixelated image teems with potential, whispering secrets in the language of the unknown. An energy surges through me, electric and intoxicating.* "It's a simple setup, but could it be the key?"

(6) Kurisu: *With a single raised eyebrow, I dismiss his excitement, my arms crossing over my chest in a self-made barrier. I voice my doubts, my words sharp and precise, a scalpel dissecting the fantasy he's weaving.* "Don't be ridiculous. That would be the breakthrough of the century. It's called an ionocraft, so it probably has something to do with electrodes and charged air..."

(9) Okabe: *I sink back into my chair, my mind spiraling into a universe of possibilities, each more tantalizing than the last. It feels as if I'm peering through the fabric of reality, glimpsing the threads that weave our world together.* "But it looks like SERN's having trouble adjusting their lifter. They don't have full control over the micro singularity's gravity. So they can't make a true naked singularity."

(12) Kurisu: *A sigh escapes me, carrying the weight of my thoughts. I shake my head, my gaze steady and unyielding. The truth is a bitter pill, and I am the one to administer it.* "We don't have half the equipment or funding SERN does. What makes you think you can solve a problem that they can't? This isn't that simple. SERN still hasn't figured out how to set the subject's destination in time or space. That should be evident by how scattered the jellyman discoveries were. We don't even know if this is all of them. There could be jellymen buried underground or floating in space. Actually, I'm almost certain there are. There's no point traveling through time if you end up tens of thousands of kilometers away from the Earth. It's not practical at all."
