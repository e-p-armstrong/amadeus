Lines chosen for the radical enhancement:

(4) Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest as I watch Daru set the microwave's timer. The room is filled with an intense energy as we prepare for the experiment. I reach out and grasp the microwave's door handle, my palms sweaty with anticipation. Mayuri seeks cover, her eyes wide with fear and excitement.*

(8) Okabe: *The moment Kurisu hits send, I yank open the microwave door. The room is filled with a blinding light and a loud crackle of electricity.*

(10) Okabe: *I throw my head back and laugh maniacally, my heart pounding with adrenaline and excitement.* "MUHAHAHAHA! It's working! It's working, you guys!" *The cushion underneath the PhoneWave (name subject to change) collapses under the weight, and the floor starts creaking. The room is filled with the smell of ozone, and my hair stands on end from the static electricity in the air.*

(12) Okabe: *I disconnect my phone from the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and check my mail. My heart skips a beat as I see two emails, both written in English and timestamped from five days ago.*

Enhanced Lines:

(4) Okabe: *A symphony of anticipation beats within my chest, a rhythmic crescendo matching the ticking timer of our mechanical marvel. The lab breathes with us, its every corner soaked in a palpable energy that prickles my skin with electrifying promise. My hand, slick with the sweat of excitement, finds the cold, metallic handle of the microwave, a silent promise of the pandemonium to come. Mayuri, sweet, trusting Mayuri, seeks refuge behind a lab table, her eyes wide pools of fear and exhilaration, reflecting the chaotic dance of our shared hope and dread.*

(8) Okabe: *In the heartbeat that Kurisu's finger depresses the send button, I wrench open the portal to our collective destiny. The room erupts into a maelstrom of light, a blinding, searing white that devours our reality, while the air shivers with the raw, untamed crackle of unleashed power.*

(10) Okabe: *The world tilts on its axis as I surrender to the intoxicating thrill of triumph, my laughter echoing through the lab, a wild, manic symphony of success.* "MUHAHAHAHA! It's working! It's working, you guys!" *The lab seems to share my jubilation, the floor beneath the PhoneWave groaning in protest, its sturdy surface buckling under the weight of our achievement. The pungent tang of ozone floods the room, a testament to the raw power we've unleashed, while my hair dances on my scalp, tickled by the mischievous fingers of static electricity.*

(12) Okabe: *With trembling fingers, I disconnect my lifeline to the present, my phone, from our time-traveling marvel. I navigate the familiar digital landscape, my heart pounding an erratic tattoo against my ribs as I open my mailbox. There, bathed in the cold, sterile light of the screen, lay two emails, their words written in the language of the west, their existence marked from a time five days past. Five days into the future. Five days into the past.*
