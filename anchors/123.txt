The four anchor lines I've chosen are:

(2) Okabe: "The kind you wouldn't believe. We're building the first time machine in human history."

(11) Okabe: "Alright, leave it to me. Daru, go tell my assistant to lay off the experiments for now."

(17) Suzuha: "She's... my enemy."

(26) Okabe: "I have come!" 

For (2), I'll emphasize Okabe's excitement and pride over their creation. For (11), I'll focus on his sense of responsibility and leadership. For (17), I'll highlight Suzuha's seriousness and the mystery behind her hostility towards Kurisu. For (26), I'll showcase Okabe's theatrical nature and his attempt to muster courage for the confrontation.
