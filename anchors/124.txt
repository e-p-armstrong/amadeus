Enhanced lines:

(1) Okabe: *My heart hammers against my ribcage, a relentless drumbeat that mirrors the rhythmic shaking of our crumbling laboratory. Cracks spider across the concrete ceiling, releasing a shower of dust and debris that dances like snowflakes in the air. My gaze darts around the room, landing on the source of the chaos - the damned Phone Microwave. A growl of frustration rumbles in my throat. Daru, I explicitly told you to halt the experiments!* 

(3) Okabe: *My heart plummets, sinking like a stone in the depths of my stomach. I swallow hard, the taste of failure bitter on my tongue. I draw myself up to my full height, fixing Tennouji with a resolute gaze.* "Leave it to me, Mister Braun! On my honor, I swear there won't be any more shaking today!" *With that, I whirl around and dash out of the workshop, the door slamming shut behind me. My breath comes in ragged gasps as I burst into the lab, a desperate plea spilling from my lips.* "Christina! Stop the experiments at once!"

(10) Okabe: *The faint tremor of fear that had been coursing through my veins slowly recedes, replaced by a weary sense of relief. I shudder, the memory of Tennouji's seething rage still fresh in my mind.* "Yeah... I could feel his Killing Aura." *I survey the room, my gaze falling on the two girls who seem blissfully unaware of the gravity of the situation. I run a hand through my hair, a sigh escaping my lips.* "Anyway, no more experiments today."

(17) Okabe: *A chuckle bubbles up from within me, breaking the tense silence that had settled over the room. I can feel the weight of the day's events lifting slightly, replaced by a sense of camaraderie that only shared adversity can bring. I glance at Kurisu and Mayuri, their faces tinged with the same exhaustion that I feel.* "I understand. Nobody will blame you if you don't use it. Of course, since the three of us stayed up all night, we're all pretty smelly. Heh heh heh."
