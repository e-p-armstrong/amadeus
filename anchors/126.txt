The four lines I've chosen as anchors are:

(1) Mayuri: "And you can send 36 letters in a D-Mail, but everything past that disappears, right-? So I think maybe you can't send big things, or a lot of small things. Maybe the Curb black hole--"

(9) Okabe: "Stop making her say stuff like that!" Mayuri has flowers for brains, so she's easy prey for Daru's antics. It drives me crazy.

(15) Okabe: "Heh. Is that so, assistant?"

(26) Kurisu: "I don't think it's that simple. I mean, I'm sure SERN's tried that already. And yet they haven't gotten any results after nine years of experiments. It's not as simple as increasing the flow of electrons."

Mayuri is an innocent and cheerful character, often oblivious to the deeper scientific concepts. Her actions will reflect a sense of wide-eyed curiosity and earnestness. Okabe, on the other hand, is a confident and eccentric character who often teases others but deeply cares about his friends. His actions will showcase his protective nature and his cheeky humor. Kurisu is a brilliant scientist who often takes the lead in explaining complex theories. Her actions will reflect her deep thought process and her dedication to their shared goal.

(1) Mayuri: *I pause, my finger tapping against my chin in thoughtful rhythm. My eyes flicker with the spark of understanding, an epiphany slowly unraveling before my mind's eye.* "And you can send 36 letters in a D-Mail, but everything past that disappears, right-? So I think maybe you can't send big things, or a lot of small things. Maybe the Curb black hole--"

(9) Okabe: *My voice cuts through the room like a blade, a fierce protector rising against a perceived threat. My heart clenches in my chest, a tinge of frustration simmering beneath the surface. I hate how easily she falls for his antics, her naivety both endearing and infuriating.* "Stop making her say stuff like that!" *Internally, I sigh, an image of Mayuri's innocence painted vividly in my mind.* Mayuri has flowers for brains, so she's easy prey for Daru's perversions. It drives me crazy.

(15) Okabe: *My lips curl into a smirk, my eyes gleaming with mischievous delight. The opportunity to tease Kurisu is a temptation I can't resist, a playful dance of words that always ends with her flustered and me laughing.* "Heh. Is that so, assistant?"

(26) Kurisu: *My fingers drum against the tabletop, a rhythmic pattern that echoes the racing thoughts in my mind. My brows furrow, creasing with the weight of our shared burden. I can almost see the walls of the Kerr black hole, the relentless force of supergravity that has thwarted our progress.* "I don't think it's that simple. I mean, I'm sure SERN's tried that already. And yet they haven't gotten any results after nine years of experiments. It's not as simple as increasing the flow of electrons."
