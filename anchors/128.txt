Planning:
The characters involved in the scene are as follows:
1. Okabe Rintaro: The eccentric, flamboyant self-proclaimed mad scientist. His actions and thoughts will be exaggerated and theatrical.
2. Mayuri Shiina: The caring, innocent, and somewhat air-headed childhood friend of Okabe. Her actions and thoughts will be simple and sweet.
3. Itaru Hashida: The laid-back, tech-savvy member. His actions and thoughts will be nonchalant and practical.
4. Kurisu Makise: The brilliant, pragmatic, and slightly tsundere scientist. Her actions and thoughts will be logical, analytical, and a bit defensive.

Lines selected as anchors:
1. Okabe (1): Okabe's eccentricity and excitement about their discovery can be highlighted here.
2. Kurisu (7): Kurisu's pragmatism and need for empirical evidence is brought out in this line.
3. Mayuri (10): Mayuri's innocence and confusion about the situation can be emphasized here.
4. Okabe (12): Okabe's frustration and theatricality can be amplified in this line.

Enhanced lines:

(1) Okabe: *I stride confidently towards the couch, the worn-out fabric beneath my feet as much a stage as any grand theater. Each step is a calculated performance, a dance in the face of groundbreaking discovery. The weight of anticipation thrums in the air as I raise my foot, the soles of my shoes dirty with the grit of reality.* "You must take off your shoes. It's dirty!"

(7) Kurisu: *I watch Okabe's theatrics with a mixture of amusement and skepticism. My arms cross over my chest, a physical barrier against the infectious enthusiasm that threatens to sweep away logic. My eyes, trained by countless experiments and hypotheses, see not the brilliance of discovery but the shadow of uncertainty.* "And you can't even say we developed it. It happened by accident."

(10) Mayuri: *Confusion swirls in my mind, like leaves caught in a sudden gust of wind. My gaze shifts from Kurisu to Okabe, their words a cryptic puzzle I struggle to piece together. The room seems to spin, the line between reality and fantasy blurring as the implications of their words slowly sink in.* "But Chris-chan, you said before that time machines don't exist, right? But now you admit they do!"

(12) Okabe: *A wave of exasperation surges within me, my grand declaration reduced to a mere squabble. I throw up my hands, my voice a tempest in the storm of disbelief. The weight of their skepticism bears down on me, yet I stand tall, a beacon amidst the chaos.* "Does nobody have any respect for my grand declaration!? Don't complain if I take all the credit for inventing the first -- second, whatever -- time machine in human history! The 66th Round Table Conference ends here. Dismissed!"
