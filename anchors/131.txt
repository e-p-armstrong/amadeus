Enhanced Lines:

(1) Okabe: *I felt the relentless pressure of Moeka's persistence, a silent storm brewing in her presence. The suffocating silence of the lab was punctuated by the staccato rhythm of her typing, each keystroke a hammer to my anxiety. I swallowed hard, the taste of impending doom bitter on my tongue. I had to regain control.* "It's me. There's a problem. ...No, not that. Information on Number 8 got leaked to a third party. ...Yeah, I know. I need to do something. Depending on the situation, I may have to silence her. ...Yeah, I know. We can't let the Organization know about this. Steins Gate seems to enjoy sending trouble my way. ...Heh, don't worry. My seat in hell can wait until Ragnarok is over. El Psy Kongroo." *I stowed my phone away, my hand trembling ever so slightly, my gaze returning to the enigma that was Moeka.*

(7) Okabe: *My heart pounded in my chest like a frantic war drum, echoing the urgency of my situation. I whipped around to face Itaru, my eyes blazing with frustration and fear. The words slipped from his lips like a traitor's secret, and I felt the world come crashing down.* "Imbecile! Because of your careless tongue, she found out that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is a time machine!"

(10) Okabe: *Despair washed over me, a tidal wave of defeat that left me gasping for breath. I could feel my control over the situation slipping away, a sandcastle crumbling under the relentless tide of misfortune. My shoulders sagged, the weight of my failure too heavy to bear.* "Guh... This is a disaster. All the worst-case scenarios are unfolding before my eyes. How do I salvage this? I need to silence Moe--"

(12) Okabe: *I collapsed onto my knees, the harsh reality pulling me down like a marionette cut from its strings. I could taste the bitter tang of surrender on my lips, the flavor of defeat clinging to my tongue. I turned my gaze to Moeka, my plea echoing in the silence of the lab.* "Kiryu Moeka. I'll tell you everything... and I have a favor to ask. Tremble, right arm of mine! By the covenant I command thee. Come forth, hellfire of darkest black! Fulfill my desire for ultimate destruction. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust! Hrraahm!!" *I thrust my arm towards the ceiling, my declaration a desperate cry in the abyss of my despair.*
