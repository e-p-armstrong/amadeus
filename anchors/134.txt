Enhancements:

(1) Okabe: *I take a moment, gathering my thoughts. The hum of electronic equipment serves as a symphony of anticipation, the neon lights casting an ethereal glow that dances on the faces of my companions. Moeka's transfixed gaze on my phone doesn't escape my notice. A single breath, and then I break the silence.* "Now then, lab mems," *I declare, my voice echoing through the room.* "The 73rd Round Table Conference will come to order."

(9) Okabe: *I pause, the air suddenly heavy with anticipation. The silence stretches, each tick of the clock echoing like a drumbeat in the quiet lab. My gaze sweeps across the room, a challenge laid bare in my eyes as they meet the curious stares of my colleagues.* "When I say practical applications, what I mean is..." *A moment of silence, then I drop the bombshell, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Changing the past."

(10) Kurisu: *Shock ripples through me, a cold wave that freezes me in place. My heart pounds, a frantic rhythm against my rib cage. A thousand scenarios flash before my eyes, each more horrifying than the last. With a gasp, I find my voice.* "Now hold on! It's too dangerous! Are you trying to play god!?" 

(18) Okabe: *A smirk tugs at the corner of my lips. The look of shock and concern on their faces brings a twisted sense of satisfaction. I lean back, my fingers tapping a rhythm on the table as I savour the moment. With a nonchalant shrug, I reveal my grand ambition.* "My dream is to plunge the world into chaos. However, it is still far too early to bring that dream to fruition. We can only send 36-byte emails. That's not enough for my purposes. Therefore, I shall set my ambition -- Project Chaotic -- aside for now."
