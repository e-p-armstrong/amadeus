Planning and Brainstorming:

From the provided text, the most important lines that can be used as anchors are the first and last lines spoken by Okabe (1 and 22), and two lines from Kurisu, where she shows her practicality and empathy (5 and 16). 

Okabe is eccentric, passionate, and theatrical. His actions will reflect his self-proclaimed "mad scientist" persona, grandiose and filled with grandeur. His thoughts will be filled with a sense of superiority and amusement at the others' "lack of imagination".

Kurisu is practical, serious, and empathetic. Her actions will reflect her scientific mindset, focused and analytical. Her thoughts will be a mix of skepticism and curiosity about the potential of their experiment.

Rewrites:

(1) Okabe: *The lab hums with anticipation, matching the beat of my racing heart. The weight of the moment settles in my chest, a symphony of uncertainty and excitement. I survey my comrades, their faces etched with contemplation, their minds no doubt grappling with the sheer magnitude of our endeavor.* "Even with a time machine before you all, this is all you can think of. You guys sure lack imagination. If there are no other suggestions, we'll use my plan." *A smirk pulls at the corners of my mouth as I pull out my phone, reveling in their stunned silence. The thrill of the unknown is intoxicating, a sweet nectar I can't resist.* "It's me. We're beginning stage two of Operation Urd. Yeah, no problem. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall take all responsibility. Heh, don't worry. Nothing will come back to you. Correct. This is my choice, and the choice of Steins Gate. Ragnarok is near. El Psy Kongroo." *I pocket my phone, my gaze sweeping over my fellow lab members, their faces a canvas of emotions.* "Now, begin the operation!"

(5) Kurisu: *My fingers drum against my arm, a rhythm of thought echoing through the tense silence. My mind is a whirlwind, a storm of possibilities and probabilities. I swallow hard, steeling myself against the rising tide of uncertainty.* "No, first we need a winning number." *The words hang in the air, a beacon of reason amidst the chaos.*

(16) Kurisu: *My eyes narrow, my mind spinning with the implications of our experiment. My heart pounds in my chest, a metronome to my racing thoughts. A shiver runs down my spine, the chill of the unknown sweeping over me.* "If someone sent me the winning numbers from the future, would I believe it?" *The question hangs heavy, a specter of doubt amidst our grand plans.*

(22) Okabe: *A wry smile tugs at my lips, a nostalgic note amidst the symphony of the present. My hand idly traces the contours of my phone, the cool metal a stark contrast to the warmth of the memories bubbling to the surface.* "...I tried the LOTO SIX once." *The admission echoes in the silent lab, a simple truth amidst the complexity of our endeavor.*
