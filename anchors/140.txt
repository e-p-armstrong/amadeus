Enhanced Lines:

(1) Okabe: *My hand, shaking like a leaf caught in a storm, makes its way to the button on my phone. The digital envelope takes flight on the screen, 'Sending mail' etching itself in blinding pixels. My heart echoes the countdown, each throb a tick closer to the unknown. And then it hits â€” a tidal wave of vertigo, washing over me, blurring the edges of reality, turning the vibrant world into shades of grey. I clutch my phone like a lifeline, my body recoiling from the guttural sense of wrongness that gnaws at my insides.*

(5) Okabe: *My eyes dart to Mayuri, her face a beacon of normality in this warped reality.* "Mayuri, how long have I been standing here?" *The words tumble out, laced with my growing unease. My gaze, feverish and frantic, roams the room, the familiar becoming foreign, the details jarringly misplaced. The PhoneWave is silent. Daru, once a fixture by the X68000, now lounges aimlessly. Kurisu, her place in the development room usurped, engrossed in a book on the sofa. Nothing aligns. Nothing makes sense.*

(9) Okabe: "30 seconds? Really?" *The words escape, disbelief etched in every syllable. It feels like an eternity, a lifetime lived in those fleeting moments. My pulse throbs in my ears, a deafening metronome marking the seconds that seem to stretch into infinity. The reality of the situation dawns on me, a monstrous revelation that sends a shiver down my spine.*

(17) Okabe: *My eyes dart to the date on the received mail. A week ago. The words echo in my mind, a haunting chorus of reality.* "The mail arrived a week ago." *My heart hammers against my ribcage, each beat a drumroll to the undeniable truth. I've reached back, touched the past, altered the course of my own timeline. The gravity of my actions settles in, a chilling epiphany that leaves me reeling.*
