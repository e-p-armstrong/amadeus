Planning:

The characters involved and their archetypes/personalities:

1. Okabe: The protagonist and a self-proclaimed "mad scientist". He is usually eccentric and dramatic, but in this scene, he is confused and agitated due to the unexpected effects of the D-mail he just sent.
   
2. Kurisu: A genius scientist who is typically calm and composed. However, in this scene, she is confused by Okabe's erratic behavior.

3. Daru: A laid-back and jovial hacker who is usually easygoing and humorous.

4. Mayuri: A cheerful and innocent character who is often oblivious to the scientific complexities that the others delve into.

5. Moeka: A quiet and introverted character who usually communicates through text messages rather than speaking.

6. Luka: A gentle and shy character who is often hesitant and unsure.

Lines chosen as anchors:

1. (1) Okabe: "What did you say just now?"
   
2. (7) Okabe: "Daru! I sent myself the winning LOTO SIX numbers just now. Didn't I?"

3. (15) Okabe: "My heart skips a beat, my confusion deepening. What?"

4. (26) Okabe: "I barely register Lukako's arrival, my mind a whirlwind of questions and fear. I can't stop sweating. And it's not because of the heat. I don't know what's going on anymore. Questions keep spinning around in my head."

Thematic direction:

1. (1) Okabe: Show Okabe's increasing panic and the stark contrast between his distress and the others' casual demeanor. Use descriptive language to emphasize the sense of unease and confusion he's feeling.

2. (7) Okabe: Showcase Okabe's desperation and his struggle to make sense of his friends' reactions. 

3. (15) Okabe: Highlight the moment of realization and the sinking feeling of dread that Okabe experiences when he understands that his friends are unaware of the D-mail he sent.

4. (26) Okabe: Emphasize Okabe's growing fear and confusion, and his inability to comprehend the situation. 

Enhanced lines:

(1) Okabe: *My throat tightens, my words come out strangled, the edges of my vision blur, everything save for the faces of my friends fading into insignificance.* "What did you say just now?"

(7) Okabe: *My voice echoes through the room, the desperation in it laying bare my escalating panic. I turn to Daru, my trusted friend, my eyes begging him for confirmation, for some sign that I'm not losing my mind.* "Daru! I sent myself the winning LOTO SIX numbers just now. Didn't I?"

(15) Okabe: *A wave of cold dread washes over me, my heart skips a beat, my breath catches in my throat, as if the air around me had suddenly become too thick to breathe. My confusion deepens, my mind stumbles and trips over each word they say.* "What?"

(26) Okabe: *I'm in the eye of a storm, my mind a whirlwind of questions and fear. Sweat trickles down my forehead, the clamminess of my skin a stark reminder of the dread gnawing at the pit of my stomach. I barely register Lukako's arrival, the sight of him nothing more than a fleeting shadow in the corner of my eye.* "Questions keep spinning around in my head."
