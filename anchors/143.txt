Enhanced Lines:

(1) Okabe: *The ghostly pallor of my phone screen reflects in my eyes, a stark reminder of the message that has vanished from existence. My heart pounds in my chest, each throb echoing the reality of my predicament. The world around me blurs as I tuck the phone back into my pocket, my fingertips grazing the cool metal. With a sigh that feels like it's been dragged from the very depths of my soul, I push open the lab door, stepping out into the bustling streets. The city's cacophony washes over me, a welcome reprieve from the silence of my own thoughts.* "This can't be..."

(9) Okabe: *My words are abruptly cut off as Suzuha lunges towards me, her fingers prying open my eyelids. I stumble back, surprise sparking in my chest like a live wire. I can feel the cool touch of her fingers against my skin, the world around me refracting in a dizzying array of colors as she peers into my eyes.* "Nwohh!? Wh-wh-what are you doing!?"

(19) Okabe: *A shiver runs down my spine as I recall the horrors of the Organization's secret facility. My words are barely above a whisper, each syllable carrying the weight of my memories. My mind conjures up images of sterile white walls, the cold touch of steel, the relentless ticking of a clock. I close my eyes, trying to push away the haunting echoes of the past.* "The Organization's secret brainwashing facility, known as Apocalypse of Galient. That place is a living hell. I don't want to revive any suppressed memories."

(24) Okabe: *A spark of excitement ignites in my chest, fanning the flames of my theatrics. I throw my head back, a maniacal laugh ripping from my throat, echoing around the streets. My eyes gleam with a fervor that borders on madness, my body trembling with anticipation. I can feel the adrenaline coursing through my veins, the thrill of the unknown beckoning me forward.* "Heh heh heh. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall be the one to answer that."
