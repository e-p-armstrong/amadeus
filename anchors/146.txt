Enhanced Lines:

(1) Tennouji: *I stand taller, my arms folding over my chest as my piercing gaze locks with Okabe's. The shop's buzzing neon lights cast a harsh shadow across my stern face.* "Understand? I won't let you off easy next time you make moves on my daughter."

(7) Okabe: *As Suzuha's apology fades into the bustling sounds of Akihabara, I turn my back to the shop, my heart pounding a rhythm of unease. Each step towards the lab is a step further into the mystery that's consumed my thoughts. I shake my head, attempting to clear the fog of uncertainty.* "Wait! We'll talk when everything's over." *As I climb the stairs to the lab, I explain about Mr. Braun's return, and then dismiss everyone for the day.*

(9) Okabe: *My gaze drifts around the lab, lingering on familiar, comforting objects before settling on Kurisu. Despite the warmth of the room, a cold knot of anxiety tightens in my stomach.* "Hey, assistant. You're not going back to your hotel?"

(16) Kurisu: *I lean back in my chair, my gaze softening as I take in Okabe's weary expression. Despite our constant banter, I can't ignore the concern that gnaws at the edges of my mind.* "You're the lonely one, aren't you? You've been acting gloomy all day. Do you need some advice? I'm an outsider, in a sense, so it should be easier to talk to me, right? A man getting advice from a younger woman is kind of *mumble mumble*, but if you're fine with that, then just ask away."
