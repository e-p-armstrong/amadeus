Rewriting the Anchors:

(1) Okabe: *With a sudden burst of energy, I bolt upright, my lab coat whipping about in a dramatic flourish. The sunlight glints off my outstretched hand as I point an accusatory finger towards Nae.* "How many times must I proclaim it to the heavens?!" *My voice reverberates through the morning air, an echo of my unyielding conviction.* "Call me Kyouma!"

(7) Mayuri: *Radiating cheerfulness, I lift my hand in a warm wave, the other hand balancing a bag filled with the familiar shapes of convenience store food. The morning sunlight filters through my hair, creating a soft halo around me.* "Good morning, Okarin!" *My voice, sweet as the morning dew, carries the infectious joy I feel in seeing my friends.*

(14) Okabe: *Leaning back against the rough exterior of the shop, I pop the candy into my mouth, the sweet taste a momentary distraction from my thoughts. My gaze travels towards the clear blue sky, my mind lost in the intricate plans and theories that form the backbone of our lab.* "I'm waiting for all lab mems to assemble." *My words carry the weight of my dedication, my commitment to the lab and its members evident in the firm set of my jaw.*

(24) Mayuri: *I pause in my actions, my cheerful demeanor giving way to a brief frown. My eyes dart around the lab, the usual clutter and chaos seeming empty without the presence of our friends.* "Daru-kun and Chris-chan are kinda late, huh?" *The concern in my voice is as clear as the worry etched on my face, my heart aching for the absent members of our makeshift family.*
