Planning:
I'll focus on lines (1), (6), (11) and (15) as they hold significant narrative weight, revealing more about the characters' personalities, their relationships, and the overall tension of the scene. 

1. Okabe: He's the ambitious leader, a bit eccentric and dramatic. He's also compassionate, but tries to hide it under a façade of toughness. I'll portray his determination and internal struggle as he tries to keep the experiment on track while dealing with the emotions of his team members.
   
2. Kurisu: She's a brilliant scientist, serious and mature, but also has a softer, more vulnerable side. I'll emphasize her internal conflict as she tries to balance her scientific curiosity with her concern for the team and their experiment's implications.
   
3. Daru: He's a laid-back, humorous character who often lightens the mood. I'll use his line to highlight the levity he brings to the scene, while also hinting at his underlying curiosity about the experiment.

Rewritten Anchors:

(1) Okabe: *A surge of determination pulses through my veins as my fingers tap out a response to Moeka's mail. The send button clicks under my thumb, a resounding declaration of my resolve. I tear my gaze from the screen, my heart pounding a rapid tattoo against my ribs. Each step back to the lab echoes with the weight of the task that lies ahead, my mind a swirling vortex of thoughts and strategies.*

(6) Okabe: *I cross my arms, steeling myself against the surge of emotions threatening to break my composed façade. A stern expression carves itself onto my face, my gaze hardened with the gravity of our undertaking.* "My request is that its contents be simple and easy to measure, so that we can confirm whether or not the past changes." *I arch an eyebrow, a challenge wrapped in curiosity.* "A secret? What do you mean?"

(11) Kurisu: *Her arms fold across her chest in a defensive posture, a crimson blush creeping up her cheeks in a rare show of vulnerability.* "I-I'm not agreeing with you, exactly. If we don't collect data, then we'll never figure out how the PhoneWave works." *Her voice is a steady lighthouse amidst the tempest of emotions swirling within her, a testament to her unwavering commitment to science.*

(15) Kurisu: *Her nod is firm, a silent affirmation of her support. Her gaze is unwavering, an unspoken promise of her commitment to the cause.* "Even if you want to send something private, you shouldn't for now. We still don't know how this thing handles paradoxes, so we need to be extremely careful." *Her words echo through the lab, a sobering reminder of the stakes at hand.*
