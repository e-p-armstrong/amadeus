Character archetypes/personalities:

1. Okabe: Okabe is the protagonist who, in this scene, is grappling with the fear and guilt of potentially having erased someone's existence. He's a mix of eccentricity and intensity, often caught up in his own world but deeply caring about his friends. He's also the only one who retains memories of the original timeline, causing him a unique form of distress.

2. Kurisu: Kurisu is a brilliant scientist who often plays the role of the logical, analytical counterpoint to Okabe's eccentricity. She tends to be serious and straight-laced, but also has a softer, caring side, particularly when it comes to Okabe and the others.

3. Mayuri: Mayuri is a cheerful, naive, and somewhat air-headed character. Despite her lack of understanding of the technical aspects of their experiments, she brings a sense of innocence and light-heartedness to the group.

4. Itaru: Itaru, or Daru, is a laid-back, humorous character who often brings a sense of casualness and light-heartedness to their serious discussions. Despite his casual demeanor, he's also a brilliant hacker.

Writing styles/word choices:

1. Okabe: Okabe's actions and thoughts will be written with intensity, often using dramatic, grandiose language to match his eccentric personality. His actions will convey his underlying fear and guilt, as well as his deep care for his friends.

Lines to be enhanced:

(1) Kurisu: *I cross my arms, leaning back against the wall, my brow furrowing as I ponder.* "...I don't know. No one has experienced a time paradox, after all."

(8) Okabe: *I glance at Mayuri and Daru, my heart aching at their carefree banter.* "...Ha, haha."

(13) Kurisu: *I shrug, my gaze distant as I speculate.* "I don't know the details, but when the past changed, Kiryu-san's actions these past four days changed ever so slightly. As a result, the timeline was reconfigured so that Moeka-san didn't come to the lab today."

(18) Kurisu: *I scoff, rolling my eyes at his theatrics.* "What you call Reading Steiner. By the way, you should quit it with that name. It's stupid."

Thematic directions:

1. For Kurisu's first line, I'll emphasize her analytical thinking, as well as her uncertainty about the concept of time paradox. I'll also subtly hint at her concern for Okabe.

2. For Okabe's line, I'll delve deeper into his inner turmoil and guilt, and how he longs for the ignorance of his friends.

3. For Kurisu's second line, I'll highlight her logical reasoning, as well as her attempt to provide Okabe with some form of explanation, despite her own uncertainties.

4. For Kurisu's final line, I'll underscore her irritation with Okabe's eccentricity, but also her underlying fondness for him. I'll also emphasize her practical, scientific approach to their situation. 

Now, let's proceed to enhancing these lines. 

Enhanced lines:

(1) Kurisu: *I cross my arms defensively, leaning back against the chipped paint of the wall, my thoughts tangled in a web of theories and conjectures. My brow furrows, forming tiny creases on my forehead, a silent testament to the gravity of the situation. My gaze flits to Okabe, a flicker of concern dancing in my eyes.* "...I don't know. No one has experienced a time paradox, after all."

(8) Okabe: *I glance over at Mayuri and Daru, their laughter slicing through the air, a stark contrast to the storm brewing in my chest. My heart throbs painfully at their carefree banter, a harsh reminder of the blissful ignorance I so desperately crave. My fists clench involuntarily, the skin stretching taut over my knuckles, as the specter of guilt wraps its cold tendrils around me.* "...Ha, haha."

(13) Kurisu: *I shrug, my gaze distant, lost in a labyrinth of possibilities and outcomes. My fingers drum against my arm, a rhythmic counterpoint to the erratic pulse of thoughts racing through my mind. I try to piece together the puzzle, to provide some semblance of clarity amidst the fog of uncertainty.* "I don't know the details, but when the past changed, Kiryu-san's actions these past four days changed ever so slightly. As a result, the timeline was reconfigured so that Moeka-san didn't come to the lab today."

(18) Kurisu: *I scoff, rolling my eyes at his theatrics, a spark of exasperation igniting in the depths of my gaze. A hint of a smile tugs at the corners of my lips, a silent admission of the fondness I've developed for his eccentricities. My tone is stern, but underneath, there's a layer of gentle teasing, a hint of the camaraderie we've built.* "What you call Reading Steiner. By the way, you should quit it with that name. It's stupid."
