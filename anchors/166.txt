**Rewriting the selected lines:**

(1) Okabe: *I find my gaze drawn to the worry etched into the soft lines of her face. A captive bird, fluttering anxiously within the confines of her gilded cage, concerned for the falcon who holds the key. A wry smile, a fleeting specter, flits across my face, chased away by the solemnity of her gaze.* "I'm fine. Don't worry about a thing." *I dismiss her fears with a casual shrug, my words as light as the feathers of the falcon, but my thoughts are heavy, weighed down by the unyielding gravity of the past. A memory, a ghost from a decade ago, emerges from the shadows of my mind, its chains rattling with the familiarity of awakening from a feverish stupor to find her tear-streaked face looming above me. The echo of the Reading Steiner reverberates within me, a chilling reminder of the eerie similarity.* "I see! So this power was already mine back then! Muhahaha!" *My laughter, a lone wolf's howl in the silent night, marks my revelation. Born with this power, a Messiah in the eyes of John Titor. As the echoes fade into the abyss, the knock at the door signals the arrival of an unexpected guest.*

(11) Luka: *Caught in the swirling vortex of their banter, I find myself adrift, struggling to anchor myself amidst the tempest. Their words, playful jabs and jests, dance around me like fireflies, their luminescent glow just out of my reach.* "What should I..." *I mumble, my voice a soft sigh carried away by the turbulent winds of their conversation, my mind a tangled labyrinth of confusion.*

(14) Okabe: "Lukako, though you are my disciple, you still lack dedication." *My words, a gentle reprimand wrapped in the velvet of concern, hang heavy in the air. Stern, but not unkind, a reflection of the moonlight against the dark canvas of the night sky.* "At this rate, it will take some time before you can be useful. By the way, why not join our lab?" *The invitation, a beacon in the storm, extends from me like a lifeline. My tone, once stern, softens like melting ice under the warmth of the spring sun, welcoming him into our chaotic symphony of scientific endeavor.*

(17) Mayuri: "We'd love to have you, Luka-kun! But you know, if Luka-kun's gonna be a lab mem, then Mayushii has one condition for Okarin. Don't tease Luka-kun." *My words, firm and resolute, act as a shield, a protective barrier between the delicate blossom that is Luka and the teasing winds of Okabe's banter. I step in, a guardian angel in the face of his jests.* "And today, Luka-kun is Mayushii's guest. He came for a fitting session, so don't get in our way." *My gaze, normally as soft as the morning dew, hardens into a stern look, a silent warning to Okabe to tread carefully around our guest.*
