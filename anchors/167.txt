Planning:

Lines to enhance:

(8) Okabe: *I step forward, placing a hand on Lukako's shoulder.* "Listen, my pupil. To change your clothes is to change your very being. This costume might help you grow stronger. Put it on at once!"
This line serves as a turning point in the scene where Okabe tries to convince Luka to try on the costume. I will embellish it to display Okabe's mentor-like persona and his persuasive tactics.

(15) Mayuri: *I grab Lukako's arm, pulling him towards the changing room with an excited squeal.* "Come on, Luka-kun! Transform! Tra-ns-form♪"
This line showcases Mayuri's excitement and determination to see her creation on Luka. I will enhance it to bring out her bubbly personality and her affectionate relationship with Luka.

(18) Luka: *I squeal, trying to pull away from Mayuri's eager hands.* "Wahh! Mayuri-chan, please don't touch me there! I'll change by myself! Please wait outside!"
This line underscores Luka's discomfort and embarrassment. I will develop it to emphasize his shy and reserved nature.

(23) Itaru: *My eyes widen, my smirk growing wider.* "Then it's reverse rape!? Whoa, that's downright criminal!"
This line shows Itaru's humorous take on the situation. I will enhance it to highlight his casual, laid-back attitude and his knack for making light of tense situations.

Writing:

(8) Okabe: *I stride forward, my boots clicking against the cold, hard floor beneath us. I extend my hand, resting it reassuringly on Lukako's trembling shoulder, my fingers gently squeezing in a bid to lend him my strength. My gaze meets his, unyielding and resolute.* "Listen, my pupil. To change your clothes is to change your very being. This costume might help you grow stronger. Put it on at once!"

(15) Mayuri: *My heart beats in rhythm with the excitement that bubbles within me, a symphony of joy and anticipation. I reach out, my fingers latching onto Lukako's arm, a lifeline in the sea of my enthusiasm. My voice rings out, the words tumbling from my lips like a chant, a sweet serenade of transformation.* "Come on, Luka-kun! Transform! Tra-ns-form♪"

(18) Luka: *A gasp escapes my lips, a high-pitched squeal that echoes off the walls of the room. My body jerks back instinctively, my hands flailing in an attempt to ward off Mayuri's eager touch. My words tumble out in a desperate plea, my voice barely a whisper in the flurry of movement and noise.* "Wahh! Mayuri-chan, please don't touch me there! I'll change by myself! Please wait outside!"

(23) Itaru: *My eyes widen, a spark of amusement twinkling within their depths. My lips curve upwards into a smirk, the edges tinged with humor and intrigue. I lean back, my arms folded across my chest, my words rolling off my tongue with a light-hearted ease.* "Then it's reverse rape!? Whoa, that's downright criminal!"
