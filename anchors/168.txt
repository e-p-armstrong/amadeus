Rewritten lines:

(1) Luka: *I gingerly pull at the delicate frills of my outfit, the fabric foreign and unsettling against my skin. Heat creeps up my neck, painting my cheeks a vivid shade of embarrassment. My heart pounds a turbulent rhythm in my chest, echoing my internal turmoil. I feel their eyes on me, each gaze another prick of unease.* "I-it's so embarrassing... I'm a guy... I shouldn't be dressing like this..."

(6) Okabe: *My hand instinctively finds its way to the back of my neck, massaging the tense muscles there as I grapple with my thoughts. The room suddenly feels too small, their stares too heavy. I feel the weight of the situation settle on my shoulders, a familiar sense of dread creeping into the corners of my mind. In an act of desperate distraction, I pull out my phone, pressing it to my ear with more force than necessary.* "Ah, yeah, well..."

(12) Kurisu: *With a quiet sigh, I step into the chaos that is the lab, my arrival going largely unnoticed. My lips press into a thin line of disapproval, a silent critique that goes unspoken. The laughter and playful teasing grates on my nerves, an obnoxious symphony that echoes in the confined space. The scene before me is one of juvenile chaos, a scene I've grown all too familiar with.* "Can you stop that vulgar laughter? I can hear you from outside. It's embarrassing."

(15) Kurisu: *I cross my arms, a physical barrier that matches the defiance in my gaze. The air between us crackles with tension, a silent battle of wills taking place in the heart of the lab. His words, casual and dismissive, only fuel my determination. I stand my ground, defending not only my position but also the innocent caught in the crossfire.* "I'm not your assistant. Don't make me repeat myself. Anyway! You're the worst, toying with such a weak and innocent girl. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?"
