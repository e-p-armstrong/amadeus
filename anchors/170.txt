Planning:
The four anchor lines I've chosen are:

(3) Luka: "I don't really... like how I look... I always thought... that if I were a girl... I could be a little more confident..."
This line is a pivotal moment in the scene, a revelation of Luka's innermost feelings. The enhanced version should reflect his vulnerability and struggle to express his emotions. 

(12) Okabe: "Allow me to explain. You called Lukako here a 'weak and innocent girl.' But he's not a girl at all. He's a guy!"
This line is Okabe's dramatic reveal of Luka's gender to a flabbergasted Kurisu. I'll aim to capture Okabe's theatrical flair and enjoyment of the situation.

(19) Luka: "Y-yes... I'm... a guy..."
This is Luka's reluctant confirmation of Okabe's revelation. The enhanced version should emphasize his embarrassment, fear, and relief.

(23) Okabe: "Lukako. You're fine just the way you are. I will not reject you, be you man or be you woman. Nor will anyone else here. And I will not deny your wish. Nor will anyone else here."
This line is Okabe's reassurance and acceptance of Luka. In enhancing this line, I will bring out Okabe's genuine compassion and understanding.

As for the characters' archetypes/personalities:

Luka is soft-spoken and sensitive. His actions will be written in a timid and hesitant manner, highlighting his shyness and vulnerability. 

Okabe is eccentric and dramatic. His actions will be written in a flamboyant, exaggerated style, reflecting his love for theatrics and dramatic flair.

Kurisu is logical and serious, but she also has a soft spot for her friends. Her actions will be written in a straightforward and analytical manner, but with hints of her underlying warmth and kindness.

Enhanced lines:

(3) Luka: *I shift uncomfortably, my gaze avoiding theirs as if the floor beneath me holds some fascinating secret. My voice, a timid whisper, seems to get lost in the silence, the words stumbling over each other in their haste to escape.* "I don't really... like how I look... I always thought... that if I were a girl... I could be a little more confident..."

(12) Okabe: *I lean forward, my eyes sparkling with the thrill of the revelation. A smug grin dances on my lips, relishing in the bafflement that paints their faces. My voice, a dramatic whisper, spills the secret with a flourish, like a magician revealing the climax of his act.* "Allow me to explain. You called Lukako here a 'weak and innocent girl.' But he's not a girl at all. He's a guy!"

(19) Luka: *I gulp, my face heating up as if I've confessed to a crime. My gaze drops, focusing on the floor as if it's the most interesting thing in the room. My voice, a mere ghost of a whisper, carries the truth I've been hiding, like a bird finally breaking free from its cage.* "Y-yes... I'm... a guy..."

(23) Okabe: *I look at Lukako, my gaze steady and sincere. My voice, usually full of jest and drama, now carries a weighty sincerity, like a lighthouse beacon cutting through the fog of doubt.* "Lukako. You're fine just the way you are. I will not reject you, be you man or be you woman. Nor will anyone else here. And I will not deny your wish. Nor will anyone else here."
