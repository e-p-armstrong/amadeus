(13) Okabe: *I straighten my posture, my heart pounding with exhilaration as the lab echoes with the resonating timbre of my voice.* "It's too late to hide behind your goody-two-shoes mask, Christina. Your fate is to become a mad scientist, for you are an experiment-loving girl!" *My words hang in the air, a theatrical ultimatum wrapped in a veil of mock severity. I watch her, my eyes gleaming with anticipation, the corners of my mouth tugging upward into a knowing grin.*

(18) Itaru: *I swallow hard, feeling a sudden weight pressing down on me. My hand, previously idling on my lap, shoots up into the air, cutting through the room's jovial atmosphere like a cold winter gust.* "Hold on, man! What are you going to do if the experiment works?" *My voice, usually so calm and unassuming, rings out with a hint of desperation, echoing my deep-seated concern for our naive meddling with the fabric of reality.*

(24) Luka: *I feel a lump in my throat, my heart pounding like a drum against my chest. The room around me seems to blur as I gather every ounce of courage I possess, raising my hand as if it weighs a ton.* "Um... I'll take responsibility..." *My voice is a whisper, barely audible, yet it carries the weight of my resolve, the echo of a silent plea for understanding and acceptance.*

(39) Kurisu: *I inhale sharply, my mind racing with a thousand thoughts. I feel the heavy weight of responsibility looming over me, a phantom pressure that tugs at the edges of my resolve. My hand shoots up, a solitary beacon of defiance in the face of our collective madness.* "Here." *My voice is firm, my eyes locked on Okabe, a silent testament to my determination to draw a line in the sand.*
