## Brainstorming and Planning

Characters and their archetypes/personalities:

1. Okabe: Eccentric, self-proclaimed mad scientist. Often dramatic and theatrical in his actions. Tends to take charge.
2. Kurisu: Genius newcomer. Serious, analytical, often the voice of reason. Has a dry sense of humor.
3. Mayuri: Loyal childhood friend. Innocent, naive, and kind-hearted. Often has a cheerful and positive demeanor.
4. Itaru: Resident tech expert. Laid-back, often makes light of serious situations. Has a slightly perverted sense of humor.
5. Luka: Soft-spoken newcomer who dreams of being a girl. Shy, gentle, and very respectful.

Lines to be enhanced:

(2) Okabe: "Very well. Lukako, you are officially Lab Mem Number 006. Henceforth, pledge your allegiance to the lab, and devote all your strength to the enrichment of our science."

(6) Okabe: "So you were born in 1993..." *I begin to pace, my mind racing.*

(17) Kurisu: "I'll microwave your brain if you don't shut up."

(29) Okabe: "Useless, all of you! This lab is a disgrace!"

Thematic Directions:

Line 2: Theatricality of Okabe's character, the importance he places on the lab and its members. Show his excitement and anticipation for the upcoming experiment.
Line 6: Okabe's struggle to think of a solution, his frustration and determination.
Line 17: Kurisu's frustration with Itaru's flippant attitude, her seriousness about the experiment.
Line 29: Okabe's disappointment and frustration, his high expectations for the lab members.

## New Lines

(2) Okabe: *My gaze lingers over each of my fellow lab members before finally settling on Lukako. The corners of my mouth twitch into a grin as I raise my hand, the lab's fluorescent lights casting an exaggerated shadow on the wall behind me. My voice booms through the room, filled with a theatricality that only I can muster.* "Very well. Lukako, you are officially Lab Mem Number 006. Henceforth, pledge your allegiance to the lab, and devote all your strength to the enrichment of our science."

(6) Okabe: *A furrow forms on my brow as I cast a contemplative glance towards Lukako. My heart beats a frantic tattoo against my ribs, the adrenaline of the impending challenge fueling my thoughts. I begin to pace the room, the worn floorboards creaking beneath my weight, each step echoing the ticking clock in my mind.* "So you were born in 1993..." 

(17) Kurisu: *I grit my teeth, my gaze flitting towards Itaru, his flippant attitude a stark contrast to the gravity of our predicament. The frustration bubbling within me spills over, my voice laced with a biting edge, the sharpness of my words slicing through the room's tension.* "I'll microwave your brain if you don't shut up."

(29) Okabe: *I glance around the room, my gaze meeting the faces of my fellow lab members, their expressions a mirror of my own frustration. A sigh escapes my lips, tinged with disappointment and a hint of bitterness. My voice rises, bouncing off the cluttered walls of the lab, a harsh declaration of my discontent.* "Useless, all of you! This lab is a disgrace!"
