New Anchors:

(1) Okabe: *I surge with the thrill of discovery, my heart pounding against my ribs like a frantic drummer. With a swift, theatrical sweep of my arm, I bring my hand crashing down on the table, causing a small tempest among the scattered papers and gadgets. A sea of diagrams and notes ripple under the impact, a testament to our relentless pursuit of knowledge.* "The round table doesn't matter now. More importantly, the purpose of today's meeting... Is to explore methods of true physical time travel, not just D-Mail, with the objective of sending someone to the past like SERN has."

(4) Kurisu: *I fold my arms tightly over my chest, a protective barrier against the reckless enthusiasm radiating from Okabe. My gaze hardens, a piercing glare meant to ground his lofty ambitions in the sobering reality of our limited resources and understanding.* "Don't be ridiculous. SERN has the best equipment in the world, and even after nine years, they still haven't succeeded. We can't possibly hope to accomplish something like that."

(10) Okabe: *I feel an electric pulse of defiance surge through me, pushing back against the skepticism in the room. My heart throbs, a drumbeat of determination echoing within my chest, a resonating affirmation of our potential.* "Humanity's first time-traveling email. For we who have achieved that miracle, nothing is impossible!"

(27) Kurisu: *I cast a measured glance at Okabe, my gaze hardened with a steely mix of skepticism and concern. My voice, a cool counterpoint to his heated enthusiasm, is laced with a hint of bitter resignation, a reluctant acceptance of his stubborn persistence.* "If you want to become GelOkarin, I'm not stopping you."
