**Enhanced Lines:**

(3) Kurisu: *My fingers tighten around my arms as I stare at the machine, its metallic surface gleaming under the harsh fluorescent lights. My heart is pounding in my chest, a steady rhythm that echoes the urgency of my words.* "I'm telling you to know your limits. If you're going to uncover the secrets of the universe, you need personnel, equipment, and funding to rival SERN's. It's one thing to set lofty goals, but this impoverished lab has no resources to speak of." *I pause, my gaze drifting over each of their faces, their expressions a mirror of our dire situation.* "I've been thinking. Maybe we should bring the PhoneWave to a proper research institution and entrust it to a specialist. SERN's keeping their time machine research top secret, so if we make an official announcement, it'll benefit the future of mankind."

(6) Okabe: *A spark ignites in my eyes as I interrupt her, my finger pointed accusingly at her. The adrenaline surges through my veins, fueling my determination and defiance.* "And we've hacked into SERN. Those heartless bastards will do anything, even experiment on human beings. And behind them is a power greater than all the nations of the Earth. If we make the PhoneWave (name subject to change) public, they might have us erased."

(10) Mayuri: *My fingers tangle in the fabric of my dress, the soft material providing a small comfort amidst the tension. My heart feels heavy in my chest, a weight that only grows heavier with each word spoken. My voice, barely more than a whisper, echoes the fear that grips my heart.* "Mayushii's kinda scared..."

(14) Okabe: *A wild laugh escapes my lips, the sound echoing off the walls of the lab. The thrill of the unknown, the danger, the chaos, it sends a rush of exhilaration through my veins. My heart pounds in my chest, matching the rhythm of my laughter.* "Muhahaha! No way I'm giving up such an awesome machine! I am Hououin Kyouma! The insane mad scientist who rules space and time! What I desire is -- that's right -- CHAOS!"
