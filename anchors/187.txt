(2) Okabe: *As if trying to manually wring answers from the depths of my mind, my hand instinctively rises to my chin, fingers curling around its contour. My eyes drift into the distance, the visible world fading into a blur as I plunge into the labyrinth of my fragmented memories.* "But from my perspective, we sent several more."

(9) Kurisu: *My eyes narrow into thin slits, the weight of skepticism pressing heavily onto my gaze. My lips, pressed into a thin, rigid line, become the silent testament of my growing frustration. As a scientist, the world of facts and data is my realm, and Okabe's claims, shrouded in the mist of uncertainty, challenge my very core.* "Oh, right. That's what you claim, but Hashida, Mayuri-san, and I don't remember either of those."

(15) Okabe: *A lump forms in my throat, hard and unyielding, as my fingers curl into the fabric of my lab coat, the white material crumpling under the strain.* "I... think so." *I reach for my phone, the device cold against my trembling fingers. As I dial Lukako's number, I find myself holding my breath, as if the very air around me could shatter the fragile hope I'm clinging onto.*

(27) Okabe: *My heart plummets into the abyss of my chest, a cold, numbing sensation spreading through my veins as my grip on the phone tightens, the plastic creaking under the strain.* "The IBN 5100 was at the shrine though, right? Is it there now?"
