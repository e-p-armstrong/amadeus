Each tick of the clock hammers home the gravity of the situation, each echo a stark reminder of the stakes at play.* "...Damn. Okay. Sorry for calling you so suddenly."

(4) Okabe: *I straighten, my gaze hardening, my mind whirling with the possibilities. The room seems to shrink, the walls closing in as the weight of our mission bears down on me. I swallow, the sound deafening in the silence, as I steel myself for the next step.* "Mayuri, I need to contact Faris."

(6) Okabe: *I glance around the room, my gaze flitting over my friends' carefree faces, their laughter grating against my raw nerves. A wave of frustration surges within me, hot and bitter, the contrast between their light-hearted chatter and the gnawing concern eating at me too stark to ignore.* "You people don't have a care in the world, do you!? There's some crazy stuff happening here!"

(14) Okabe: *I reach out, my fingers trembling as I snatch the phone from Mayuri, the screen cold and unyielding beneath my touch. I glance down at Faris' smiling face, her image a stark contrast to the knot of tension coiling in my stomach. I swallow hard, my throat dry as I steel myself to speak, my voice a low rumble of determination.* "It's me. Hououin Kyouma."
