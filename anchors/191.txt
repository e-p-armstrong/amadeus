Planning:
Characters:
1. Itaru (Daru): A hikikomori (a shut-in), Daru is a skilled hacker and Otaku, with a love for all things "moe" (adorably cute). His actions and thoughts will be filled with references to Otaku culture, and his sense of humor. He's dramatic and tends to overreact.
2. Okabe: The self-proclaimed "mad scientist," Okabe is dramatic, eccentric, and prone to bouts of paranoia. He often refers to a mysterious "Organization" and plays along with delusions of grandeur. His actions will be filled with theatricality, conspiracy theories, and paranoia.
3. Mayuri: The heart and soul of the group, Mayuri is innocent and endearing. She has a childlike sense of wonder and is often the voice of reason. Her actions will be filled with naivety, fascination, and innocent wonder.

Lines to enhance:
1. (3) Itaru: Daru's reaction to Okabe's revelation about Faris' real name. His actions will highlight his dramatic nature and his love for Faris' professional persona.
2. (9) Mayuri: Mayuri revealing Faris' real name. Her actions will emphasize her hesitance and carefulness about keeping secrets.
3. (14) Okabe: Okabe's realization of their destination. His actions will be filled with paranoia and suspicion.
4. (21) Okabe: The group's introduction to Faris' personal space. His actions will capture the awe and curiosity.

Enhanced Lines:
(3) Itaru: *My heart feels as though it's been punctured, the air rushing out in a gasp that tastes like disbelief.* "Uwahh, you're the worst! Why do you have to crush my dreams like that, man?" *I clasp my hands over my ears, trying to shield myself from the harsh reality, my eyes squeezed shut as if denying sight could also deny truth.*

(9) Mayuri: *My heart pounds in my chest, a drum echoing the gravity of the secret I'm about to reveal.* "Okay. Feris-chan's real name is Akiha Rumiho-chan!" *The words tumble from my lips, spilling into the air between us, as I watch their faces for a reaction, hoping I've done right by my friend.*

(14) Okabe: *I mutter the name under my breath, the syllables rolling off my tongue like a secret code.* "Akiha..." *A spark of recognition ignites within me, burning away the fog of confusion.* The same characters as in Akihabara. Appropriate. *My eyes trace the towering form of the building before us, its steel and glass structure reflecting our own stunned faces back at us.* "Our destination turns out to be this high-rise apartment building next to UPX."

(21) Okabe: *As we step into the room, a sense of awe washes over me. We're led into a room, where Faris stands before a large window, her silhouette framed against the sprawling cityscape beyond.* "She lives... here?" *Every detail of the room screams of a life far removed from our shared reality, a stark contrast to the playful persona we've come to know.*
