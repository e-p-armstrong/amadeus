Lines to Enhance:

(1) Faris: *I smile coyly, my fingers gently tracing the contours of Okabe's cheek.* "That's because..." *I pause for dramatic effect, grinning at the bewildered look on Okabe's face.* "Faris is Faris, nyaâ™ª"

(6) Okabe: *I cross my arms, doing my best to hide my own vulnerability.* "I don't care about any of this!" *I point an accusatory finger at Faris.* "Do not defy me, Faris NyanNyan, or I'll paint your expensive wallpaper with blood. You called me to your home so you could show off your status and try to gain leverage in our negotiations. But it's futile. For you are dealing with the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!"

(11) Faris: "Honestly, Faris didn't want to talk so much about herself, nya. Most people, when they learn who I am, stop seeing me as Faris, nya. They only see the Akiha name. Faris and Akiha Rumiho want to be seen as separate purrsons, nya."

(19) Okabe: *I cross my arms over my chest, doing my best to maintain my composure.* "Faris, you said there would be a price to pay in exchange for your help acquiring an IBN 5100. What is your price? Do not test the limits of my good will. If I unseal my right arm for even an instant, everything will be destroyed, and nothing will remain... just so you know."
