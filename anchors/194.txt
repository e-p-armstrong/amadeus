Planning: 

In this scene, we have four characters with distinct personalities. 

- Okabe is the eccentric, theatrical leader who sets a serious yet dramatic tone. He is protective of the lab's secrets but also open to newcomers if they can meet his unique requirements. 
- Itaru is the practical and slightly timid character who often acts as the voice of reason. He is welcoming but also cautious and somewhat sceptical of Okabe's theatrics. 
- Mayuri is the cheerful and innocent character who brings a sense of lightness and positivity to the scene. She is easily worried but also easily reassured, and is always excited about the prospect of new members. 
- Faris is the playful, curious outsider who is eager to join the lab. She is intrigued by the time machine and ready to meet any challenge to gain access to it. 

I will focus on the four most critical lines, which represent turning points in the scene: 

(1) Faris's request to use the time machine, revealing her ulterior motive for visiting the lab. 
(6) Okabe's response, setting the condition for her to become a lab member. 
(11) Okabe's dramatic description of the blood oath, showing his theatrical nature and raising the stakes. 
(18) Faris's surprise action of taking the blood oath, demonstrating her determination and adding a moment of tension to the scene. 

My thematic direction will be to enhance the playful yet serious atmosphere of the scene, emphasising each character's unique personality and their reactions to the unfolding events. I will add more depth and detail to their actions, thoughts and expressions to make the scene more vivid and engaging. 

Enhanced lines: 

(1) Faris: *With a mischievous sparkle in my eyes, I lean forward, the corners of my lips curling into a playful grin that belies the gravity of my words.* "Well, I guess I'll tell you, nya. My price..." *A chuckle ripples through me, a ripple of mirth that doesn't quite reach my eyes, belying the seriousness beneath the feline facade.* "Is to let me use your time machine, nya."

(6) Okabe: *With a stern gaze fixed on Faris, I clasp my hands behind my back, assuming the posture of a seasoned commander addressing his troops.* "The time machine is our lab's greatest secret. If you want to use it, then you must become a lab mem."

(11) Okabe: *A slow, mischievous grin snakes its way across my face, my eyes gleaming with a devilish glint that mirrors the storm brewing outside.* "There's no contract. We only require that you perform... the blood oath."

(18) Faris: *Nodding solemnly, I muster all the determination I possess, my voice steady, a firm resolve reflected in my eyes.* "Very well, nya. I shall take the blood oath, nya..." *With a swift, fluid motion, I seize the small knife from my desk, slashing it across my wrist in a dramatic display of commitment.*
