Enhanced lines:

(2) Okabe: *I shake my head, my voice echoing with authority and confidence, reverberating through the cluttered lab.* "It doesn't actually have to run the entire duration." *I draw a mental map of our previous experiments, feeling the familiar thrill of discovery, my fingers tapping an impatient rhythm on the table.* "The mail reaches the past if you send it as soon as the discharge begins. In accordance with the Butterfly Effect, the remaining seconds should be canceled out. The experiment never happened." *A smirk tugs at the corners of my mouth, a sense of satisfaction blooming within me as I remember our previous triumphs. My fingers dance over the phone's buttons, dialing Kurisu's number with practiced ease.*

(11) Kurisu: *I chuckle softly, the sound muffled by the static of the phone line. My voice is laced with amusement, a playful edge that contrasts with my usual analytical tone.* "You were talking crazy, so I got scared and hung up." *I toss my hair over my shoulder, my eyes sparkling with suppressed laughter. I can almost see Okabe's indignant expression, his eyes wide behind his glasses, his mouth open in disbelief.*

(20) Okabe: *I quickly relay the necessary information, my mind buzzing with the thrill of the impending experiment. My heart pounds a drumbeat of anticipation against my ribcage.* "Okay, it's ready." *My voice carries a sense of urgency, my words punctuated by the rapid beat of my heart.* "Alright, thanks. Wait a bit." *I turn to Faris, my eyes meeting hers, a silent question hanging in the air.* "Finished writing what you want to send?" *I watch as Faris nods, a sense of relief washing over me.* "What did you write? You sure it's something that'll change the past?"

(25) Faris: *I feel a surge of frustration, my cheeks flushing a fiery red. My voice rises in volume, each word a defiant challenge.* "What's that supposed to mean!? No one said anything about science, nya! I'm using the time machine for myself, not science, nya!" *I cross my arms over my chest, my cat-ear headband twitching with my irritation. My eyes flash with determination, my heart pounding with the thrill of rebellion.*
