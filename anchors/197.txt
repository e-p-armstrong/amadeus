Enhanced lines:

(1) Okabe: *My teeth grind together, each nerve in my body strung taut as a wire as Kurisu's voice drills into my eardrum through the phone. A bitter taste floods my mouth, the metallic tang of frustration. The plastic casing of the phone creaks under my tightening grip, mirroring the pressure building within me. I can almost hear the crack of my resolve, echoing in the hollow silence of my mind.* "Don't rush me, dammit!"

(3) Okabe: *I can feel my blood turning to ice as Mayuri's words sink in. The world around me seems to blur as I stare at her in disbelief. The soft glow of the lamp casts eerie shadows on her innocent face, the very picture of betrayal. A lump forms in my throat, choking me, the sour taste of defeat threatening to spill from my lips.* "Wh-what? Even Mayuri's on Faris's side?"

(5) Okabe: *My voice comes out in a shaky whisper, my words hanging heavy in the air. I can feel the weight of my surrender pressing down on me, my spirit crumbling like a sandcastle against the relentless tide. A sigh escapes my lips, the sound echoing in the silence of the room. I can feel the eyes of my friends on me, their gazes piercing through my facade.* "W-wait! Fine. Activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change)." 

(19) Mayuri: *My voice wavers, my plea hanging in the air like a fragile thread about to snap. I can feel the tension in the room, the expectant silence pressing down on me. My gaze flickers to Faris, her triumphant smile feeling like a dagger in my chest. I can barely hear my own voice, the words sounding distant, as if they were coming from somewhere far away.* "H-hey, could you wait one... no, two or three turns, nya? Please, nya?"
