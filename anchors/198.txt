(1) Itaru: *As the imposing figure of Faris-tan's dad looms nearby, I find my fingers unconsciously scratching the back of my neck, an old habit I resort to when I'm nervous or awestruck. My eyes dart towards him, then back to my friends, caught between the urge to greet him and the fear of embarrassing myself. I swallow, my voice hitching slightly as I manage to ask,* "Whoa, Faris-tan's dad... Shouldn't we say hello?"

(11) Okabe: *I turn my gaze towards the bustling streets of Akiba, my eyes distant and thoughtful as they take in the sea of faces, each engrossed in their own little worlds. I can't help but see them as ignorant masses, desperately seeking a fleeting respite from the gnawing pain of existence. The world around me blurs into a kaleidoscope of colors and sounds, but all I can hear is the deafening silence of my own thoughts.* "Nothing. I was just looking at Akiba, watching the ignorant masses scurry about in search of momentary surcease from the pain of existence."

(13) Okabe: *As we bid our goodbyes and venture into the sweltering heat of the setting sun, I feel a bead of sweat trickle down my cheek. The relentless crowd in front of Akiba Station, a motley mix of locals and foreigners, all lured by the siren call of electronics and otaku goods, feels like a living, breathing entity of its own. In the midst of this chaos, I yearn for the cool comfort of Faris's air-conditioned apartment and the homey simplicity of our lab. I turn around to consult Daru and Mayuri about our plan, only to find a void where Mayuri had been standing.* "Huh? Where'd Mayuri go?"

(18) Mayuri: *I halt my steps, turning around to wave at Okabe with a giggle, my eyes sparkling with anticipation and excitement. My fingers absent-mindedly twirl a strand of my hair as I break into a wide grin, oblivious to the confusion my sudden disappearance had caused. My heart is already at Nakano Broadway, lost among its countless wonders.* "Ehehe. Sorry. All I could think about was going to Nakano."
