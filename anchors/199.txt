Brainstorming and planning:

The characters involved are Okabe Rintaro, Itaru "Daru" Hashida, and Mayuri Shiina. Okabe is the protagonist who is currently facing a major dissonance between his memories and reality, which is causing him distress. Daru is Okabe's otaku friend who's a bit of a pervert but also smart and logical, while Mayuri is Okabe's childhood friend, who is innocent, cheerful, and a bit air-headed. 

For Okabe, I'll use descriptive and intense language to portray his internal struggle and growing panic. For Daru, I'll use casual and laid-back language, with a bit of humor. For Mayuri, I'll use soft and sweet language to portray her innocence and cheerfulness.

The lines I'm choosing as anchors are:

(7) Okabe: This is the first instance where Okabe's confusion becomes apparent. This line can be used to set the tone for Okabe's struggle with the shifting reality.

(9) Okabe: This line is a major turning point in the scene, where Okabe realizes that his memories do not match the current reality. 

(15) Okabe: This line signifies Okabe's desperate attempt to hold onto his memories and his disbelief at the changes.

(25) Okabe: This is the final line of the scene where Okabe has come to terms with the changes and is filled with a sense of loss.

Rewriting:

(7) Okabe: *I feel a knot of confusion tightening in my gut, a disconcerting sense of disorientation clouding my thoughts. My gaze flickers between the two of them, their casual banter sounding alien in my ears.* "What are you guys talking about? If you want doujinshi, why not go to Toranoana? It's right over there."

(9) Okabe: *A confident smirk tugs at the corner of my lips, the familiar landscape of Akihabara etched in my memory. I stretch out my arm, pointing to the store that's always been there. But as my eyes follow my finger, my smirk fades, replaced by a gasp of disbelief. My heart hammers in my chest, each beat echoing the growing dread in my mind as I fail to find Toranoana.* "Wha...?" *I rub my eyes, desperately willing them to adjust to the reality that doesn't align with my memories.* "Where the hell did Toranoana and Animate go!?"

(15) Okabe: *A cold sense of dread takes hold of my heart, squeezing it with an iron grip. My voice rings out, echoing my disbelief and panic. The words tumble out, a desperate plea for validation.* "But Akiba is the holy land of moe! The whole world knows that!"

(25) Okabe: *A wave of despair washes over me, draining the color from the world around me. My fists clench, the cold reality sinking its teeth into my heart. My voice is but a whisper, a mournful lament for the lost landscape of my memories.* "Chaos has forsaken this place..."
