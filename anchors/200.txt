Character Archetypes/Personalities:

1. Okabe - Eccentric, dramatic, perceptive. As the only one aware of the worldline shifts, Okabe carries a burden that is both isolating and confusing. His actions will reflect his struggle to make sense of the changed reality and his guilt over causing it. His dialogue is often laden with a sense of dramatic flair, and his thoughts should follow suit.
2. Mayuri - Innocent, cheerful, and a little airheaded. Mayuri's actions will reflect her innocence and confusion about Okabe's odd questions. She's not privy to the changed worldline, and her innocence is a stark contrast to Okabe's burdened persona.
3. Itaru (Daru) - Laid-back, smart, and a bit of a joker. Daru often lightens the mood with his casual attitude and humor. His actions will reflect his relaxed nature and his knack for bringing a lighter touch to serious situations.
