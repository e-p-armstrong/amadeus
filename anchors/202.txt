1. Okabe: A self-proclaimed mad scientist with a flair for the dramatic. He's eccentric and often insensitive, but deeply cares for his friends. His words are often grandiloquent and theatrical.

2. Kurisu: A brilliant scientist who is often the voice of reason in the group. She's quick-witted and isn't afraid to call out Okabe on his eccentricities. She's compassionate, especially towards Luka.

3. Luka: A gentle, timid individual who struggles with their gender identity due to a past event involving time-travel. They're soft-spoken and easily affected by Okabe's words.

4. Mayuri: Okabe's childhood friend who's known for her bubbly personality. She's kind-hearted and empathetic, often acting as the group's moral compass.

Lines to Enhance:

(16) Luka: This line is the emotional climax of the scene, where Luka finally speaks up about their feelings. The enhancement should emphasize their pain and vulnerability.

Enhanced Lines:

(4) Kurisu: *I snap my book shut with a force that echoes through the room, a declaration of war against the brewing storm. I throw Okabe a pointed glare, my eyes crackling with the electricity of a brewing tempest.* "Fine, I'll be blunt. There's no way I'm swimming with two perverts like you! If it's just the girl members, I'll happily go."

(9) Okabe: *With a dramatic sweep of my arm that belongs more on a theatrical stage than in this humble lab, I point at Luka. A twisted smile curls on my lips, completely oblivious to the frigid chill creeping into the room.* "Didn't we tell you earlier? Lukako is a bonafide guy!" *My laughter echoes hollowly, the chilling silence that follows my words slicing through the joviality like a cold blade.*

(12) Kurisu: *I step forward, my gaze like a laser cutting through Okabe's ignorance. A deep breath fills my lungs, my fists clenching at my sides, the knuckles white against the backdrop of the escalating tension.* "Okabe!" *The name bursts from me like a bullet, the echo of my disappointment lingering in the air.* "If you want to give me stupid nicknames, that's fine -- I mean, it's not, but... What you said just now is below the belt. I didn't take you for the kind of guy who thinks it's funny to hurt people's feelings, but I guess I was wrong. You're a real jerk, Okabe."

(16) Luka: *I slowly rise from the sofa, my voice a fragile whisper lost in the storm that rages around me.* "It's okay." *My head remains bowed, my hands trembling, the world around me blurring through the veil of unshed tears.* "So that's how Okabe-san sees me..."
