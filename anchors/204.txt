Rewritten Anchors:

(1) Okabe: *A low chuckle bubbles up from my chest, echoing in the silence of the lab. My fingers drum against the tabletop, each tap a testament to the rhythm of my genius.* "Heh heh heh... as I already explained, we changed the past. Lukako was a guy, but he wanted to be a girl, so we sent a D-Mail to make his wish come true. And it worked! I knew the worldline had changed. My magic eye, Reading Steiner, saw the shift in time. But I chose to believe my mundane senses instead. I should have had more faith in my powers! I won't make that mistake again."

(4) Kurisu: *My grip tightens around the spine of the book, each word of Okabe's grand speech chipping away at my patience. I steady my voice, a stalwart lighthouse amid the storm of his theatrics.* "Sit down before I hit you again."

(6) Mayuri: *My eyebrows knit together, a silent plea for understanding. My head tilts to the side, the cogs of my mind turning, desperate to keep pace with their relentless debate.* "Shredding Gar?"

(12) Okabe: *My laughter rings out, a defiant bell in the face of Kurisu's criticism. I run a hand through my hair, my grin unwavering, my spirit unbroken.* "Heh heh heh... looks like you've still got that Mongolian Spot on your butt. Eh, Christina? Names are all about feeling! My creativity, comparable to the great Da Vinci himself, cannot be held by the shackles of grammar! Muhah--" *My words are cut short as Kurisu's book connects with my head, a painful punctuation to our lively debate.*
