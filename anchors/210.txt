Character Archetypes/Personalities:
1. Okabe: Eccentric, melodramatic, and likes to act as a mad scientist. He often refers to himself as 'Hououin Kyouma' and plays along with his self-created narrative of being pursued by an 'Organization'.
2. Itaru: Laid-back, a bit of a pervert, and a dedicated otaku. He often expresses disappointment or frustration in a light-hearted manner.
3. Mayuri: Innocent, cheerful, and somewhat air-headed. She often tries to maintain a positive atmosphere.
4. Kurisu: Intelligent, logical, and somewhat tsundere. She often tries to bring everyone back to reality and is usually the one to question Okabe's eccentric behavior.
5. Luka: Shy, timid, and polite. He often stutters and apologizes.

Enhanced Lines:

(10) Itaru: *My shoulders slump, the weight of my disappointment sinking me deeper into the worn-out cushions of the lab's couch. The words leave my lips in a sigh, a breathy admission of defeat.* "You've gotta be kidding me! I was looking forward to that time machine meet..."

(18) Luka: *My fingers curl into the hem of my apron, my knuckles turning white from the pressure. My gaze remains stubbornly fixed on the floor, unable to meet anyone's eyes. I can feel the heat rushing to my cheeks, a burning testament to my embarrassment.* "That's probably the smell of... Mayuri's cooking..."

(29) Okabe: *My fingers tighten around the edge of the table, my knuckles turning a stark white against the worn-out wood. My gaze sweeps over the chaotic scene, the lab filled with smoke and the unmistakable scent of a culinary disaster. A wave of dizziness washes over me, a disorienting fog that blurs the edges of my reality.* "I'm getting dizzy. This isn't the future I was hoping for."

(35) Okabe: *My fingers reach for the lab coat draped over the back of my chair, pulling it on with a sense of urgency. The fabric clings to my skin, a familiar weight that grounds me in the midst of chaos. I close my eyes, my voice dropping to a whisper, a solemn invocation of my alter ego.* "Is this the choice of Steins Gate? El Psy Kongroo..."
