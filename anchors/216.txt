Enhanced lines:

(3) Okabe: *A smirk tugs at the corner of my mouth, a facade hiding the underlying unease that coils in my stomach like a restless serpent. My fingers dance over the surface of the table, tracing an imaginary battle plan.* "Heh. Is that so? If you think the Four Guardian Kings can stop me, just wait and see. Akiba will be drowning in blood before nightfall." *My words, a daring challenge to the invisible adversaries, hang heavy in the air, a promise echoing in the silence of the makeshift lab.*

(7) Okabe: *My fist clenches with a fervor that belies my desperation, knuckles white as they bear the weight of our predicament. My gaze hardens, a reflection of the steel in my resolve.* "No, it's not over yet. If I can just acquire the item, I can turn the tide! Have you still not located an IBN 5100!?" *The question, imbued with an urgency that threatens to shatter the calm facade, reverberates through the room, a desperate plea for hope in a sea of uncertainties.*

(9) Okabe: *My throat constricts, each swallow a desperate attempt to quell the rising tide of panic. My heart pounds, a relentless drum echoing the ticking seconds of the dwindling time.* "Please hurry. I'm running out of time." *My plea, a whisper barely louder than a breath, is carried on the wings of urgency and cloaked in the chilling mantle of fear.*

(11) Okabe: *Annoyance bubbles up, the abrupt end of the conversation leaving a bitter taste on my tongue. With a huff, I shove my phone into my pocket, the cool metal a stark contrast to the warmth of my palm.* "Yeah, I can't die yet... El Psy Ko--" *My words hang unfinished in the air, an incomplete mantra swallowed by the click of the disconnected call. I wipe the sweat off my brow, a futile attempt to erase the gnawing worry that clings to my every thought.*
