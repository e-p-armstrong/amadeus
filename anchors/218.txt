Brainstorming/Planning:

Characters and their traits:
1. Okabe: Paranoid, dramatic, serious, intelligent. His prose should be detailed and slightly frantic, with a touch of grandiosity.
2. Itaru: Cheerful, laid-back, tech-savvy. His actions should reflect his jovial nature, and his thoughts should demonstrate his fascination with technology.
3. Mayuri: Innocent, naive, cheerful. Her actions and words should be simple and light-hearted, reflecting her lack of scientific understanding but genuine interest.
4. Kurisu: Serious, intelligent, focused. Her prose should be direct and grounded, reflecting her practical nature.

Lines to enhance:
1. Okabe: Line 1
2. Itaru: Line 2
3. Okabe: Line 7
4. Kurisu: Line 17

Thematic Directions:
1. Line 1: Highlight Okabe's paranoia and obsession with their discovery. The prose should reflect his frantic thoughts and the high stakes of their situation.
2. Line 2: Reflect Itaru's fascination with the technical aspect of their discovery. His excitement should contrast Okabe's paranoia.
3. Line 7: Convey Okabe's fear and realization of being possibly watched by SERN. The prose should be intense and filled with suspense.
4. Line 17: Capture Kurisu's seriousness and the weight of her interruption. Her prose should be direct and filled with gravitas.

Enhanced lines:

(1) Okabe: *My fingers dance a frantic ballet across the keyboard, each stroke a testament to the forbidden knowledge we've unearthed. The glow of the screen bathes my face in an ethereal light, reflecting the surreal speed of our connection.* "There's only one step..." *I murmur, my mind a whirlwind of thoughts, each more terrifying than the last.* We're directly connected to SERN, bypassing any intermediate servers. This machine, dubbed AKIHABARA_PC, is our direct line to France. But why?

(2) Itaru: *I recline, my chair creaking under the weight of my enthusiasm. A grin unfurls across my face, as wide and open as a child's on Christmas morning.* "And the transfer rate is hundreds of times better than usual. Crazy fast! You can't even get these numbers domestically, man."

(7) Okabe: *A chill traces its icy fingers down my spine, my mind spinning with grim possibilities.* "SERN did it themselves." *I mutter, my voice a mere whisper in the thick silence. I glance at Itaru, who swallows hard, his face ashen and slick with sweat, mirroring my own rising fear.* We are in the open. SERN could be watching our every move. Or maybe they have been expecting us for years. The thought is chilling.

(17) Kurisu: *I push open the door to the development room, the gravity of my expression seeping into the room, an omen of dark tidings.* "Okabe."
