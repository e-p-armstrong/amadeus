Planning and Brainstorming:

The characters involved are:

1. Okabe: The self-proclaimed mad scientist, who is often over-dramatic and eccentric, but truly dedicated to their research. He is also the leader of the group, guiding the conversation and making connections.

2. Kurisu: A brilliant scientist who is analytical and logical, often playing the role of the voice of reason among the group. She is also reserved and cautious.

3. Itaru: The tech-savvy member of the group who is often nervous and uncertain, but incredibly passionate about his work.

4. Mayuri: The innocent and naive member of the group, who often does not understand the scientific jargon but is always interested and supportive.

Lines chosen for enhancement:

1. (1) Okabe: "So, if the LHC was created to generate mini black holes-- Then the PhoneWave (name subject to change) must also produce mini black holes!"
2. (6) Kurisu: "Like I said, I don't know what."
3. (12) Okabe: "And that, my fellow lab members, brings us to the question. Can the PhoneWave (name subject to change) beat SERN to true physical time travel?"
4. (16) Okabe: "As for the lifter, we already know it exists. We just need to figure out what it is."

The thematic direction for each line:

1. Okabe's first line will focus on his realization and the excitement that comes with it. His actions will emphasize his enthusiasm and eccentricity.
2. Kurisu's line will be filled with frustration and uncertainty. It will show her struggle to understand the unknown.
3. Okabe's second line will be heavy with the weight of the challenge they face. It will reflect his determination and leadership.
4. Okabe's third line will display his confidence and belief in their ability to solve the problem, demonstrating his unwavering faith in their group.

Enhanced lines:

(1) Okabe: *My heart thunders in my chest, each beat a drumroll for the revelation that's about to burst forth. I can't help the manic grin that stretches across my face, my fingers drumming an erratic rhythm on the table as the pieces of the puzzle fall into place.* "So, if the LHC was created to generate mini black holes-- Then the PhoneWave (name subject to change) must also produce mini black holes!"

(6) Kurisu: *The frustration gnaws at me, a bitter taste of uncertainty that sours my tongue. I cross my arms, my gaze unfocused as I wrestle with the enigma before us. I'm a scientist, I should be able to figure this out. But the answer eludes me, slipping through my fingers like sand.* "Like I said, I don't know what."

(12) Okabe: *I stand, my gaze sweeping over the cluttered lab, our makeshift battlefield against the world's secrets. My voice booms in the silence, a war cry cloaked in a question. It's not just about beating SERN, it's about proving our worth, showing that we, too, can conquer time.* "And that, my fellow lab members, brings us to the question. Can the PhoneWave (name subject to change) beat SERN to true physical time travel?"

(16) Okabe: *I lean forward, my hands splayed on the table, each finger a pillar of determination. My voice is steady, filled with conviction, a solid rock amidst the storm of uncertainty. We've come so far, solved so many riddles. This is just another one, a final hurdle before the finish line.* "As for the lifter, we already know it exists. We just need to figure out what it is."
