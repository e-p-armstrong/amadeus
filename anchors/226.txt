Character archetypes/personalities:

Okabe: Eccentric, confident, insightful. He's a "mad scientist" with a penchant for theatrics but also has a deeply compassionate side. 

Kurisu: Intelligent, vulnerable, and stubborn. A brilliant scientist, she struggles with her emotional side, especially when it comes to her estranged father. 

Given these traits, Okabe's actions and thoughts will often be bold, dramatic, and somewhat over-the-top, while also revealing his deep concern for Kurisu. Kurisu, on the other hand, will be more introspective, hesitant, and emotionally charged in her actions and thoughts.
