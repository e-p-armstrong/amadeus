New Anchors:
(1) Kurisu: *I find my gaze drifting towards Okabe, my fingers unconsciously coiling around a wayward lock of auburn hair. The lab's clutter, usually a comforting chaos, now seems to amplify the silence between us. My heart pounds an unsteady rhythm against my ribs, a silent testament to the gravity of my question.* "Um, Okabe? That offer... I can take you up on it, right?"

(9) Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, my gaze hardening into a defiant glare. The lingering taste of uncertainty is washed away by a surge of determination, the kind that rises when one's back is against the wall. The fluorescent lights overhead cast a cold, unforgiving light on our shared reality.* "What? You're not going to back out, are you? You already promised. I'm taking you whether you like it or not, okay!?"

(19) Mayuri: *My fingers trace the hem of my dress, a soothing rhythm against the swell of emotions threatening to spill over. I cast my gaze downward, the cold linoleum floor offering a bland distraction from the bright brilliance of Okabe and Kurisu's intellectual camaraderie. A small sigh escapes my lips, a whisper of my insecurities.* "That's why you're shining so bright now, Okarin. Chris-chan is really a big help to you, I know... But I can't do anything to help..."

(22) Okabe: *I feel a pang of concern for Mayuri, her sadness pulling me away from the window. My gaze lingers on the starless sky, a canvas of inky blackness punctuated by the occasional blinking satellite. The distance between us and the cosmos seems a fitting metaphor for the gap between Mayuri and the world of science we have immersed ourselves in.* "Mayuri. Aren't you going to look at the stars?"
