1. (1) Okabe: *I trace the cool edge of the lab table with a steady hand, my gaze locked onto the time leap machine, its metallic sheen a testament to countless hours of tireless dedication. The weight of our creation presses heavily upon my shoulders, a silent reminder of the responsibility we bear.* "That's right. She's erased. In other words, you relive the week. You can do things the same, or you could do something completely different. And you'll keep your old memories of the week that disappeared."

2. (4) Mayuri: *My hands come together, fingers intertwining in an anxious dance as I grapple with the enormity of the concept. The world as I know it is shifting, the boundaries of reality stretching and bending in ways I never thought possible.* "So I redo the week, okay... but what if I decide to go to Ikebukuro with my friends instead of coming to the lab today? What happens to the Mayushii talking with Okarin now?"

3. (8) Mayuri: *I lift my gaze, my eyes glistening with the sheen of unshed tears, a silent testament to the poignant realization that dawns upon me. The thought of my existence being overwritten, of my moments being erased without a trace, sends a pang of sadness through me.* "That would be kinda sad..."

4. (13) Okabe: *My gaze follows hers, landing on the empty seat that Kurisu usually occupies. A rush of understanding hits me, a tidal wave of realization that sweeps over the scientific jargon and illuminates the heart of the matter - the emotional toll of our invention. It's not just about altering the past, it's about erasing memories, erasing moments, erasing ourselves.*
