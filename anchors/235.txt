Character archetypes/personalities:

Okabe: Eccentric, dramatic, considerate, and protective. He's a self-proclaimed mad scientist who is caring towards his friends. For Okabe's lines, I'll aim to inject some of his eccentricity and theatricality, yet underline his genuine concern for his friends.

Mayuri: Sweet, innocent, and enthusiastic. She's a dedicated and talented costume maker. For Mayuri, I'll keep the language simple and light-hearted, reflecting her upbeat and positive personality.

Kurisu: Sharp-witted, somewhat cynical, and pragmatic. She's a genius who's often the voice of reason amidst Okabe's dramatics. Kurisu's lines will be filled with dry humor and skepticism, showcasing her intelligence and slightly sarcastic nature.

Selected Lines for Enhancement:

(1) Okabe: "Mayuri, go home before it gets too late. Your parents will worry."

(9) Okabe: "It must be my overwhelming charisma... No, wait, that makes me sound like a good person, so that can't be it... Of course! Mayuri's parents are so afraid of my insanity that they sent me their only daughter as a hostage!"

(14) Mayuri: "Um, I told Mom and Dad that Chris-chan would be here. Then they said okay."

(18) Okabe: "Environment matters, Christina. This is a place of science and research, so you should have no trouble concentrating on your work. Trust the great Hououin Kyouma. Also, it may surprise you to learn that I have equipped this lab with a system that stimulates brain function. So if you were wondering where my incredible genius comes from, now you know! It's because I sleep in this room every night!"
