Enhanced Lines:

(5) Okabe: *A dry chuckle echoes in the room, the sound a hollow accompaniment to the dread gnawing at my insides. My hand runs through my unruly locks, a futile attempt to alleviate the mounting pressure. A flicker of resignation crosses my eyes, quickly replaced by a spark of defiance.* "In other words, you're sending me to die."

(10) Okabe: *A sigh slips from my lips, the weight of the task bearing down on me. My resolve hardens, a quiet determination settling in my gaze. The words tumble out, draped in an undertone of theatrical flair, a testament to the character I've created.* "...Fine. But hear this. I will not die! Like the immortal phoenix, I will return, no matter how many times it takes!"

(11) Mayuri: *My attention lifts from the delicate fabric in my hands, my gaze filled with a naive hope that tugs at the heartstrings. The words spill out, simple yet profound, a desperate plea wrapped in the innocence only I possess.* "Don't die. Okay?"

(16) Okabe: *My gaze sweeps over the antiquated technology surrounding me, the gears in my mind spinning in overdrive. The question lingers, a tantalizing possibility that tugs at the edges of my understanding. A dismissive smirk plays on my lips as I reject the proposal with a nonchalant wave of my hand.* "No thanks. I'm not some kind of retro TV otaku. I'd rather buy an LCD."
