Planning:
The lines I'm going to enhance are (1), (2), (3), and (7). 

1. Suzuha: She's a time traveler, firm, and serious. She's trying to prevent a dystopian future and her actions should reflect her determination, her conviction, and her urgency. I'll focus on her resolve and her unwavering gaze, emphasizing her belief in her accusation against Kurisu. 

2. Okabe: He is a passionate scientist, often acting eccentric and theatrical. He is shocked and in denial, so his actions should reflect his confusion and disbelief. I'll highlight his internal struggle, his racing thoughts, and his desperate attempt to make sense of Suzuha's accusation. 

3. Suzuha: Again, I'll focus on her determination, her unwavering gaze, and her stern demeanor, emphasizing her earnestness in her warning to Okabe. 

7. Tennouji: He is the landlord, unaware of the lab's activities, but annoyed by the disturbances. He is stern and quick to anger. His actions should reflect his frustration and his firm demand for order. I'll emphasize his anger, his booming voice, and his stern warning to Okabe.

Enhanced lines:

(1) Suzuha: *I lock eyes with Okabe, my gaze as unyielding as the steel of a drawn sword, my voice a chilling wind that cuts through the tension-filled room.* "Listen to me. She's using you all. Makise Kurisu is connected to SERN."

(2) Okabe: *A cold shiver courses down my spine, freezing my thoughts in place as Suzuha's words echo in my ears.* "What!?" *My mind is a whirlwind, thoughts colliding and scattering, desperately trying to piece together a reality that doesn't shatter my trust in Kurisu.*

(3) Suzuha: *My gaze remains fixed on Okabe, an unwavering beacon amidst the storm of his disbelief.* "You're saying she's a spy?" *My voice is barely a whisper, yet it carries the weight of irrefutable truth.* "The credit for inventing the time machine was hers." *I step back, crossing my arms over my chest, a silent wall of conviction.* "Don't let your guard down."

(7) Tennouji: *I burst from the confines of my shop, my face ablaze with anger, a human embodiment of a raging tempest.* "OKABE!"
