- (6) Okabe: *A soft chuckle escapes my lips as I gently pat Nae's head, the warmth of her innocence seeping into my fingertips.* "Indeed." *The thought of pointing the finger at Tennouji flits across my mind, but I suppress it, swallowing the bitter pill of silence for the sake of this precarious situation.*
