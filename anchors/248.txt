Enhanced Lines:

(2) Okabe: *I lean forward, my fingers intertwining, creating a mesh of shadows on the table beneath. The dim light of the lab casts an eerie glow on my face as I fix my gaze on each of them, one by one, my voice a low rumble echoing in the confines of the room.* "Basically, that little bastard would suddenly have all your perverted memories, but his personality wouldn't change. It's not like you'll become that famous anime detective with 'the looks of a child and the brains of an adult'."

(8) Kurisu: *There's a heavy silence following my question, during which I find my fingers instinctively reaching for the fabric of my lab coat, tugging at it as if it's a lifeline in this ocean of uncertainty. I lower my gaze, my eyes tracing the patterns on the tabletop, my voice barely above a whisper when I finally speak.* "It's too much for us to handle, that's for sure. The safest thing would be to hand it over to the government for professional research."

(13) Kurisu: *I lift my gaze from the table, my eyes meeting Okabe's. There's a gravity in my gaze, a seriousness that's usually masked by my analytical demeanor. I want him to understand the weight of my question, the underlying fear and concern that it carries.* "What about you, Okabe? And I mean you, not Hououin Kyouma."

(14) Okabe: *For a moment, I'm silent, my gaze drifting to the Time Leap Machine. It sits there, an ominous reminder of our creation, our responsibility. My fingers drum a silent beat on the tabletop, a physical manifestation of my internal conflict. When I finally speak, my voice is firm, the words ringing in the air with a finality that leaves no room for doubt.* "I want to experiment. But there are still questions we need to answer... Who will time leap?"
