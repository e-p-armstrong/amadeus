1) Okabe: *I find myself lost in thought, fingers absentmindedly tracing the stubble on my chin as I navigate the treacherous labyrinth of uncertainty. My eyes, narrowed slits of contemplation, flicker with the subtle dance of fear and curiosity. The whir of machines becomes a distant echo, a haunting symphony that underscores the gravity of my question.* "What if there's an error somewhere, and the data itself gets fractalized? Let's say I send my memories an hour into the past. My memories would be replaced by fractalized data. In other words, data full of tiny holes. Couldn't that cause memory loss?"

8) Kurisu: *I recline, my posture mirroring the distant gaze that's settled in my eyes. My fingers drum a silent rhythm on the table, a physical manifestation of the chaotic symphony of thoughts playing in my mind. The room seems to shrink, the walls closing in as I wrestle with the infinite possibilities of our actions.* "We don't know what happens when you time leap. If it's the many-worlds interpretation like Titor said, then the instant you time leap, it creates two possibilities -- one where you shift to another worldline, and one where you travel back in time on the same worldline. Of course, there must also be a worldline where the current you doesn't disappear. That would likely correspond to the present that we are experiencing right now."

11) Kurisu: *I instinctively cross my arms, a defensive barrier to shield me from the raw intensity of our conversation. My patience, a thin veil worn down by the relentless onslaught of questions, barely masks the flicker of impatience in my tone. Yet beneath the surface, there's a keen determination, a steadfast resolve to make sense of the enigma we're entangled in.* "I'm talking hypothetically. Titor doesn't matter right now. If it's the Copenhagen interpretation, then every possible state propagates through space as a wave function. When a particular state is observed, the remaining states collapse and that state is fixed."

15) Okabe: *I shake my head, my gaze fierce and unyielding as I grapple with the nebulous concept. The room seems to shrink, each breath becoming a battle as the weight of our discussion presses down on me. Yet, amidst the chaos, there's a spark of exhilaration, a thrill that courses through my veins as I delve into the unknown.* "Not necessarily. It might be me. It might be someone else. It could even be God."
