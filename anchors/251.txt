Character Personalities:

1. Kurisu: She's intelligent, focused and a bit sarcastic, wrestling with feelings of gratitude towards Okabe which she is uncomfortable expressing. She is also somewhat stern and serious, but she isn't devoid of humor.

2. Okabe: Okabe is eccentric, dramatic, and tends to overplay his role as a mad scientist. He is also caring and protective of his friends, though he might not express it directly.

Writing Styles:

1. Kurisu's internal monologues will be a mix of scientific thought and emotional introspection, in line with her character. Her actions will be precise, controlled, reflecting her scientific mindset.

2. Okabe's internal monologues will be grandiose, filled with dramatic flair. His actions will be exaggerated, loud, and somewhat comical, reflecting his eccentric personality.

Lines to Enhance:

(1) Kurisu: Her confession of gratitude towards Okabe is a key moment, revealing her emotional turmoil. I'll add more depth to her internal struggle and the way she delivers the confession.

(6) Okabe: His statement of his role and responsibilities as a lab founder is a central part of his character. I'll enhance this line to reflect his eccentricity and dedication to his friends.

(9) Kurisu: Kurisu's response to Okabe's dramatic self-righteousness is a moment of humor and connection between them. I'll enhance this line to highlight her amusement and fondness for him.

(14) Okabe: His expression of concern about the potential consequences of their invention gives the scene tension. I'll enhance this line to highlight his worry and the gravity of their situation.

Rewritten Anchor Lines:

(1) Kurisu: *I swallow hard, the knot in my stomach tightening as I grapple with the words that have been dancing on the tip of my tongue. My gaze is firmly fixed on the ground, as though the worn pavement could offer the courage I so desperately seek.* "No, I'm not upset. 'Humans are temporal beings.' That's a Heidegger quote. I was actually relieved when you made the decision not to use the machine. If you hadn't been there, I might not have been able to stop myself. Thank you." *The words tumble out, raw and unfiltered, echoing in the silence that follows, their weight almost tangible.*

(6) Okabe: *I throw my arms wide, a smirk tugging at the corners of my lips, the world seemingly shrinking around us as I embrace my self-proclaimed role with theatrical flair.* "Of course. I only did what I had to. I am the founder of the Future Gadget Lab, Hououin Kyouma. My first priority is to protect the welfare of my lab mems. So I have no need for your thanks." 

(9) Kurisu: *I shake my head, the corners of my lips quirking upward in a reluctant smile, my eyes shimmering with unspoken amusement. His dramatic declarations, so absurd yet so earnest, never fail to pull a reaction out of me.* "I'm speechless. You're too self-righteous."

(14) Okabe: *I frown, my heart pounding against my ribcage, the gravity of our situation washing over me like a tidal wave. The world we know could change in an instant, and the responsibility of that potential chaos rests heavily on our shoulders.* "Going public with the Time Leap Machine will send the world into an uproar. We also plan to expose SERN, remember? You may not be able to go back to America for some time."
