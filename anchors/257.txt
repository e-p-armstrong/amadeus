Enhanced lines:

(1) Moeka: *I feel my voice rising, an icy threat reverberating in the stillness of the room. My fingers, cool and detached, enclose around the gun with a chilling certainty. I lift it slowly, the weight of cold, indifferent metal dwarfing the weight of my decision. Its muzzle, a silent promise of impending doom, directs itself towards Mayuri.* "Shiina Mayuri is not needed."

(4) Okabe: "Stop!" *My body propels itself towards Moeka, fuelled by a frantic desperation. My heart echoes a frantic rhythm against my ribs, matching the chaotic symphony of fear that fills the room. A force collides with my chin, a sharp burst of pain exploding across my senses.* "Gah!" *I crumble to my knees, my world blurring into a haze of agony and despair.*

(7) Okabe: *The world around me slows to a crawl, the sharp crack of a gunshot echoing like a death knell in the air. Blood splatters across my face, its warmth a grotesque contrast to the cold reality setting in. I catch Mayuri's lifeless body, her frailty a stark reminder of the life that was extinguished. The world loses its color as I cradle her, time stretching into an agonizing eternity.*

(11) Kurisu: *I feel my heart shatter, the pieces sharp and jagged. The words leave my lips, whispered prayers that fall on deaf ears. Each syllable carries a piece of my soul with it, echoing the devastation that has taken residence within me.* "No... no!"
