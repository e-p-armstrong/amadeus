New enhanced lines:

(1) Okabe: *The world around me shudders, twisting and warping like a distorted reflection in a pool of water. Reality fragments, shatters, then reassembles in a jigsaw puzzle of incongruity. I blink, my vision blurring then sharpening, the harsh lights of the lab piercing my eyes. A sharp chill snakes down my spine, my cellphone cold and alien against my ear. The Time Leap Machine looms before me, a silent sentinel of my temporal journey. I gasp, my breath a hollow echo in the cavernous silence of the lab, my fists clenching and unclenching, a physical manifestation of my racing heart. I take a shuddering breath, the air filling my lungs like an icy balm, then another, and another, each one a step towards regaining control. Sweat trickles down my forehead, an irritating, persistent distraction. I wipe it away, but my movements feel sluggish, disconnected, like I'm a marionette on strings. Exhaustion pulls at my limbs, a heavy anchor threatening to drag me under. But I resist, focusing instead on the familiar rhythm of my heart, the steady rise and fall of my chest. This is my reality, and I must reclaim it.*

(9) Okabe: *A surge of urgency propels me forward, my mind a whirlpool of fear and desperation. Every cell in my body screams for answers, yearning for the familiarity of the known. I stumble towards Kurisu, my voice a raw scrape in my throat.* "Where am I?" *I demand, my words desperate pleas for understanding.*

(11) Okabe: *Time seems to stretch and warp, the seconds ticking by like hours. I reach out, my hands closing around Kurisu's shoulders, my grip tight, almost frantic. I pull her close, her scent a comforting anchor amidst the chaos. My words tumble out, a barrage of questions, each one more desperate than the last.* "What time is it now!? What month? What day!?" *I demand, my voice echoing the panic coursing through my veins.*

(15) Okabe: *The words hang in the air, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. The 13th, a little past 5... The numbers echo in my mind, a mantra of success. Relief floods through me, a soothing balm for my frayed nerves. But with it comes apprehension, a shadow lurking at the edges of my triumph. I've leapt through time, a feat once thought impossible. But at what cost?* "...Did it work?"
