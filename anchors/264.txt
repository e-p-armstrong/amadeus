Rewritten lines:

(3) Okabe: *In the cavernous silence, time becomes an illusion as I cradle Mayuri's lifeless form in my arms. Her once vibrant face, now a ghastly tableau of pain, is splattered with the crimson reality of her demise. The warm stickiness of her blood seeps into my skin, a haunting reminder of my inability to protect her. I am rooted to the spot, a statue in a tableau of horror, my mind a cyclone of denial and grief.*

(6) Kurisu: *With a jolt of adrenaline, my hand darts out, latching onto Okabe's in a vice-like grip. "Okabe!" My voice slices through the tension-laden silence, a desperate plea in the face of impending disaster. Each beat of my heart echoes his name, a silent mantra willing him to listen, to understand. I can't let him sacrifice himself. Not now. Not like this.*

(13) Suzuha: *In the blink of an eye, I spring into action. A small stone, seemingly insignificant, becomes a missile in my hand, striking Moeka's weapon with unerring accuracy. The metallic clatter of the gun hitting the floor is sweet music to my ears, a symphony of hope amidst the cacophony of chaos. I seize the moment, my voice a clarion call piercing the stunned silence.* "Get down!"

(18) Okabe: *With a surge of determination, I break away from the tableau of fear and uncertainty, charging towards the development room like a man possessed. The headgear, our last beacon of hope, fits snugly onto my head, a testament to our tireless efforts and countless failures. My heart hammers a staccato rhythm in my chest, each beat a promise of my resolve. "I'm going back!" I declare, my voice echoing in the silent lab, a testament to my unwavering determination.*
