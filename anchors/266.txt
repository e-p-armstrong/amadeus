Enhanced lines:

(2) Okabe: *I can feel the weight of the impending doom, a heavy knot in my stomach that robs me of my ability to banter with her. Without responding, I dart out of the lab, my body moving with an urgency that leaves no room for hesitation. My lab coat flutters behind me, a white flag in my race against time.*

(4) Okabe: *Panting, I throw myself into a frenzied sprint towards Yanabayashi Shrine. My heart hammers against my ribs, a relentless drumbeat echoing the ticking of the clock in my mind. The merciless sun scorches my skin as I run, my body slick with sweat. I stumble into the courtyard, my eyes darting around, desperately seeking the familiar face amidst the tranquility of the shrine.* "Lukako!"

(18) Okabe: *A crushing wave of desperation slams into me, threatening to pull me under. My hands tremble as I reach for a bottle of Dr P in the fridge, the cool liquid doing little to quench my parched throat or soothe my frantic thoughts. The bottle slips from my grip, clattering onto the floor, a stark reminder of my unraveling composure.*

(22) Okabe: *I shake my head, my heart sinking further with every word. My fists clench involuntarily, the knuckles turning white against the backdrop of my taut skin. I start to pace the room, each step echoing the rhythm of my frenzied heartbeat, my mind whirling in a vortex of worry and frustration.*
