Rewritten lines:

(1) Kurisu: *My heart pounds in my chest as I force myself to take a step forward, my gaze locking onto the chair clenched in Okabe's trembling hands. My voice, steady as a rock amidst a turbulent sea, breaks the heavy silence.* "Are you trying to break the machine? You don't have to break it, Okabe. We already decided not to experiment. Remember?" *I plead, my eyes begging him to see reason as I mask my concern with a thin veil of calm.* "Anyway, put the chair down."

(4) Okabe: *A shiver of dread courses through me, a chill that has nothing to do with the ambient temperature. I turn away from Kurisu, a coward's retreat, my eyes darting to the ground as if it could swallow me whole. My voice, once filled with confidence, now trembles like a leaf caught in a storm.* "I... I can't..."

(6) Okabe: *Ignoring Kurisu's plea, I turn on my heel and bolt from the lab. My footsteps echo hauntingly through the deserted streets, each step a stark reminder of my solitude. As I reach the pedestrian overpass, I squat on the cold, unfeeling concrete, allowing the relentless onslaught of city sounds to drown my thoughts. I'm adrift in a turbulent sea of guilt and fear, the reality of Mayuri's impending death a monstrous wave threatening to capsize me.*

(14) Okabe: *I keep my gaze firmly planted on the ground, a feeble shield against the weight of Kurisu's concerned gaze. Each word that leaves my mouth feels like a stone, heavy with the gravity of my guilt and desperation.* "...Help me."
