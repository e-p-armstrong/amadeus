Enhanced Anchor Lines:
1. (1) Okabe: *With a heart pounding like a war drum in my chest, I take a deep breath, steeling myself for the journey that lies ahead. My gaze lingers on the cluttered lab, the familiar chaos seeming strangely poignant now. The weight of my decision hangs heavy in the air, an invisible shroud that threatens to suffocate me.* "In a few seconds, it won't have happened."
2. (2) Kurisu: *Handing him the headgear with a quiet reverence, my mind is a whirlpool of thoughts. The cold metal feels like a promise and a curse all at once. I search his face, seeking some reassurance in his resolve, my heart aching at the sight of his determination.* "I see. That's how it looks from your perspective. What does it look like from my perspective? What happens here after you leap?"
3. (7) Okabe: *A spark of understanding flickers in my eyes as I take in her words. I can see the gears turning in her mind, the thirst for knowledge that drives her. It's a side of her I've come to admire, her dedication to science, even in the face of uncertainty.* "Because you can't collect data if you can't record the change?"
4. (10) Kurisu: *I take a deep breath, each word a command, a strategy to ensure our success. My voice is firm, decisive, echoing off the cold walls of the lab. I trust him, trust his resolve, and it's a trust that's been forged in the fires of countless trials.* "After you leap back to this afternoon, just sit tight and don't do anything until I complete the Time Leap Machine. If you accidentally prevent me from completing the machine, it will likely wreak havoc with the timeline. As soon as I finish, declare that we will not experiment. Then send everyone home. Ask me to stay. Tell me the truth. If you say you came from the future, I'll probably believe you."
