Planning/Brainstorming:

Lines to be enhanced:
- Line 1: This line establishes Kurisu's confidence and belief in her scientific work. Her words reveal her pride and conviction in her theory, as well as her eagerness to test it. I can enhance this by adding more detail about her body language, her tone of voice, and the emotions behind her words.

- Line 3: This is a light-hearted moment where Kurisu tries to ease the tension by suggesting a passphrase. The randomness of the passphrase she chooses shows her quirky side. I can enhance this by showing her nervousness and her attempt to lighten the mood through her actions.

- Line 9: This is a crucial moment where Kurisu shows her concern for Okabe. Her actions and words reveal her deep care and support for him. This can be enhanced by adding more detail about her actions, her tone of voice, and the emotions behind her words.

- Line 20: This line shows Kurisu's accomplishment and satisfaction at completing the time leap machine. She's proud of her work, yet there's also a sense of trepidation about what's to come. I can enhance this by adding more detail about her actions, her tone of voice, and the emotions behind her words.

Writing Styles/Word Choices:
- Kurisu: As a scientist, Kurisu is analytical and logical. Her thoughts and actions should reflect her scientific mindset, but also show her underlying emotions. I'll use words that suggest precision, clarity, and focus, but also include some emotional language to show her feelings.

- Okabe: Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, but he's also a caring friend. His thoughts and actions should reflect his eccentricity, but also his concern for his friends. I'll use words that suggest creativity, eccentricity, and concern.

New Enhanced Lines:

(1) Kurisu: *I lift my chin, a smirk playing on my lips as my gaze remains locked on the glowing computer screen, my reflection dancing in the digital light. The scent of overheated wires and stale coffee lingers in the air, a testament to countless hours of relentless work.* "Who knows me better than myself?" *I push back from the desk, my chair squeaking in protest, the faint hum of the lab equipment a familiar symphony in the background. My voice echoes with conviction, a testament to the hours of meticulous calculations, sleepless nights, and unyielding determination.* "Don't forget. It was my mad skillz that turned the PhoneWave into a time leap machine. When you told me about your time leap, I took it as proof that my theories were right." *The words roll off my tongue, each syllable laced with a sense of achievement and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge.* "I was happy it succeeded. I really was. I didn't doubt it was true for a second."

(3) Kurisu: *My fingers fidget with the hem of my lab coat, the cotton fabric soft under my touch, as I try to inject some lightness into the tense atmosphere.* "Just to be safe, I should probably give you a passphrase. What I want the most right now is my own fork." *The words come out in a rushed whisper, an attempt to veil the vulnerability in my voice, the slight tremor betraying my calm exterior.*

(9) Kurisu: *I reach out, my fingers lightly brushing his shoulder, a silent plea laced with a thousand unspoken words.* "Be careful. And remember..." *The words hang in the air, heavy with the weight of our shared secrets. My voice is a bare whisper, the words forced out through the knot in my throat, each syllable a testament to the depth of my concern.* "I'm always on your side."

(20) Kurisu: *I connect the final cords, the soft click echoing in the silent room, a victorious symphony to my ears. A thrill of accomplishment courses through my veins, my heart pounding in sync with the rhythmic hum of the machine.* "You win, Mayuri. Congratulations. But I'm finished too." *The words spill out, a triumphant declaration against the deafening silence. My voice echoes in the room, the word 'complete' reverberating like a triumphant battle cry, a testament to the countless hours, relentless dedication, and sleepless nights.* "Complete."
