(4) Okabe: "But I can travel to any time I had a cell phone, can't I!?" *I slam my palm onto the worn surface of the table, my veins pulsating with a wild surge of desperate hope. The echo of the impact reverberates through the room, a stark punctuation to my words. My heart pounds a frenetic rhythm against my chest, each beat a plea for a lifeline, for a glimmer of hope in the shadowed uncertainty.*

(10) Okabe: "So how come I can only leap 48 hours?" *My voice is a mere thread of sound, a ghost of my usual confidence, fading into the sterile air of our makeshift lab. I feel the cold tendrils of reality creeping in, insidious and unyielding, wrapping around my heart and squeezing, the echo of Kurisu's words hanging heavy between us.*

(16) Okabe: *A cold dread seizes my heart, each word from Kurisu's lips a hammer striking against the walls of my hope.* "So what you're saying is..." *The words trail off into a choked whisper, swallowed by the oppressive silence. I feel the weight of her revelation settling deep within me, a sinking stone in the pit of my stomach.*

Desolation sweeps over me like a tidal wave, crashing against the shores of my crumbling resolve.* "We can't do anything!? Even with the Time Leap Machine, we can't stop SERN from killing Mayuri five hours from now!?" *Each word is a plea, a cry into the void, the bitter sting of defeat lingering on my tongue.*
