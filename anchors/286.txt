## Brainstorming/Planning:

The characters in this scene are:

Okabe: He's the eccentric leader of the lab with a flair for the dramatic. He's a deep thinker and often gets caught up in his thoughts. He's also very protective of his friends. I'll use word choices and styles that reflect his analytical mind and dramatic nature. His actions will be thoughtful and calculated.

Mayuri: She's innocent and loving, often struggling to grasp complex concepts but always caring about her friends. Her dialogue will be simple and straightforward, and her actions will reflect her naivety and kindness.

Kurisu: She's a genius scientist who is analytical and rational. She often tries to bring logic and reason to the situations they find themselves in. I'll use precise and analytical language for her, and her actions will be controlled and deliberate.

Suzuha: She's a time-traveler from the future who is on a mission to change her dystopian present. She's serious, determined, and carries a lot of weight on her shoulders. Her language will be direct and purposeful, and her actions will reflect her determination and seriousness.

Daru (Itaru): He's the tech-savvy joker of the group, often bringing levity to tense situations. His language will be casual and laid-back, and his actions will often be humorous or light-hearted.

I'll choose lines (12), (17), (21), and (27) as the anchors. These lines contain key revelations and arguments that shape the understanding and direction of the scene.

(12) Suzuha: "Well, the gist is what I posted on @channel. I came from the future, the year 2036. In my time, the world is a dystopia ruled by SERN. There's no war, no conflict, but no freedom either."

(17) Suzuha: "I'm part of the Resistance fighting to free humanity from SERN's control. I came to the past to change my present. From your point of view, I guess I should say the future. To change the future."

(21) Kurisu: "SERN is a research institution. They don't have political power. I explained that to John Titor several times online."

(27) Suzuha: "SERN is still a research institution in 2036. The world is actually ruled by SERN's secret backers, the Committee of 300."


## Writing:

(12) Suzuha: *Drawing in a deep breath, I steel myself, my gaze hardening as I prepare to lay bare the harsh reality of my world.* "Well, the gist is what I posted on @channel. I came from the future, the year 2036. In my time, the world is a dystopia ruled by SERN. There's no war, no conflict, but no freedom either." *My words hang heavy in the air, a stark portrait of a future ruled not by the chaos of war, but by the iron grip of control.*

(17) Suzuha: *I lift my chin, determination burning in my eyes as I declare my purpose, my voice ringing with an unwavering resolve that brooks no argument.* "I'm part of the Resistance fighting to free humanity from SERN's control. I came to the past to change my present. From your point of view, I guess I should say the future. To change the future." *My fists clench at my sides, a physical testament to the battle I'm ready to wage against the oppressive future.*

(21) Kurisu: *Crossing my arms, I counter with logic and reason, my voice cool and analytical, a beacon of rationality amidst the spiraling chaos of this revelation.* "SERN is a research institution. They don't have political power. I explained that to John Titor several times online." *My gaze remains steady, despite the turbulence around me, challenging the notion with the unyielding truth of facts.*

(27) Suzuha: *I straighten, my voice steady as I unveil the true puppet masters of the dystopian future, my eyes shadowed with the weight of their malevolence.* "SERN is still a research institution in 2036. The world is actually ruled by SERN's secret backers, the Committee of 300." *The name reverberates through the room, a grim echo of a future dictated by unseen hands.*
