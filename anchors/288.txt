Enhanced lines:

(2) Kurisu: *I find myself leaning forward, my fingers nervously tapping against the worn table surface. The corners of my eyes crinkle with an irrepressible excitement that ignites a fire in my chest, sparking curiosity that propels my words.* "Does that mean you know how the universe works? You claimed that the Everett-Wheeler model -- the many-worlds interpretation -- is correct."

(7) Okabe: *I interrupt, my voice a low murmur in the charged silence, a thoughtful hum resonating in the air around us. My fingers drum rhythmically on my chin, a physical manifestation of the gears turning in my mind.* "Attractor Fields..."

(10) Suzuha: *With a slow, deliberate movement, I rise, my gaze sweeping over the lab before settling on Mayuri's sewing table. The room seems to hold its breath as I walk over, my boots clicking against the cold, concrete floor. I pick up a ball of red yarn, its softness a stark contrast to the weight of my words.* "The universe is made up of worldlines and attractor fields." *I drop the ball, letting the yarn unravel as I hold one end, a vivid metaphor for the vast, tangled web of time and space.* "The universe is like this piece of yarn..."

(17) Okabe: *A soft chuckle escapes my lips, a playful glint dancing in my eyes as I lean back in my chair. My mind spins the scientific jargon into a familiar narrative, weaving a tale that draws parallels between the complexities of time and the intricacies of a visual novel.* "No, he's right. It is like an eroge. Each heroine's route is an attractor field, and the small choices within are the individual worldlines. But at the end, they all enter the true route for the grand ending."
