Lines to enhance as anchors:

(4) Okabe: The gravity of the situation sinks in, and the harsh truth sends a chill down my spine. As I grapple with the realization, the words escape my lips, trembling with the weight of what they carry. "So the reason I can't save Mayuri... is that her death is the event upon which this attractor field converges?" My heart aches as the implications of my words settle in. "That means... That means the world really is killing Mayuri."

(20) Suzuha: My gaze wanders to the room filled with their confused faces, and I voice the truth, my voice steady despite the gravity of the situation. "That's because the Alpha worldline we're on represents a world where Y2K didn't occur." I can almost see the gears in their minds shifting, adjusting to this new piece of information, their eyes widening with the implications.

(32) Okabe: My heart pounds in my chest as Suzuha's words hit me like a punch. My mind reels, my thoughts racing as I clutch at the straws of hope she's just offered. "...Don't tell me!" I gasp out, my eyes wide with shock, my voice shaking with the enormity of the realization. "Reading Steiner!?"

(35) Suzuha: I look at Okabe, seeing the spark of realization in his eyes, the sudden understanding that dawns upon him. "That's the key. Your power is the key to freeing the world from SERN's rule." My words echo in the room, heavy with the weight they carry, and I can see the change they bring about in him. "You have the power of a god."
