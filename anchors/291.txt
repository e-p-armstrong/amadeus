Enhanced lines:

(6) Okabe: *A sudden understanding washes over me like a tidal wave, its force leaving me breathless and disoriented. My heart pounds in my chest, each beat a harsh reminder of our foolish oversight.* So that's what it is! *I clench my teeth, the metallic taste of regret lingering on my tongue.* "Dammit, Daru! Why didn't we use the IBN 5100 earlier!?"

(13) Suzuha: *I draw in a deep breath, the air filling my lungs with a sense of purpose, a promise of a mission yet to be completed. My gaze is unwavering, my voice steady as the ticking of a clock.* "I'm going to 1975 to obtain one."

(16) Okabe: *My gaze flits to her burnt hand, my heart aching at the sight of the blood staining my handkerchief. The fabric is a haunting reminder of the pain she's enduring, a silent testament to the cost of our actions.* "Right... your time machine's broken."

(20) Kurisu: *I cross my arms, my mind whirling with possibilities like a well-oiled machine. The gears of my thoughts click into place, each revelation a stepping stone towards the solution we so desperately need.* "Maybe we can use the Time Leap Machine to go back before Amane-san's time machine broke."
