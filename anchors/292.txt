Here are the enhanced lines:

(1) Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, my heart pounding in my chest like a desperate drumbeat. Each rhythmic thud echoes the ticking clock in my mind, the countdown to our doom. My fingers tap restlessly on the table, a silent melody of impatience and desperation. The taste of failure is bitter on my tongue, but the thought of giving up is even more unbearable. I thought we had a glimmer of hope...*

(4) Okabe: *My eyes drift to the hands of the clock, each tick a cruel reminder of our dwindling time. The room is heavy with silence, a tangible manifestation of our shared dread. The weight of their gazes feels like a physical burden on my shoulders. I force a smile, my lips curving upward in a mockery of mirth.* "You're all hungry, aren't you? You should be."

(19) Okabe: *I look at the two women in front of me, their faces reflecting the gravity of our situation. I feel a surge of determination, a fire kindling in my chest. The room seems to shrink, the walls closing in as I lean forward, my voice steady and resolute.* "Listen, you two. I'm going to leap to 2 PM on the 11th. After Titor explains herself again, we'll start repairs on the time machine. Our goal is to have it working by this time today."

(23) Okabe: *I look at Suzuha, my gaze unyielding. My voice is firm, each word echoing in the small room. "Titor. We're counting on you to get us an IBN 5100. Never forget. I'm not doing this for you, and I'm not doing it for the future. My mission is to save Mayuri. Call me self-righteous if you want. However... I'm doing this my way." I look between Kurisu and Suzuha, meeting their gazes. Kurisu and Suzuha give an encouraging nod in agreement. My fists clench at my sides, a symbol of my unwavering resolve.* "Good. Then let's begin."
