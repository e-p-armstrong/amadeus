Planning:

The main characters in this scene are Okabe, Suzuha, Mayuri, and Itaru (Daru). 

1. Okabe: A self-proclaimed mad scientist, he's eccentric, with a flair for the dramatic. He's also intelligent, caring and determined. His actions and thoughts would be analytical, passionate, and driven by a strong sense of responsibility. 

2. Suzuha: A time-traveler from a dystopian future, she's serious, brave, and dedicated to her mission. Her actions and thoughts would reflect her determination, courage, and the weight of her responsibility.

3. Mayuri: She's innocent, kind-hearted, and optimistic. Her actions would be gentle, caring, and hopeful.

4. Itaru (Daru): He's a talented hacker, a bit geeky, and light-hearted. His actions would be casual, humorous, and pragmatic.

The lines I've chosen to enhance are:

(3) Suzuha's revelation of Okabe's death in the future. I'll focus on emphasizing her regret and the gravity of the information she's sharing.

(6) Okabe's concern for Daru. I'll highlight Okabe's anxiety and his deep-seated care for his friends.

(9) Suzuha's determination to change the future. I'll emphasize her resolve and her developing emotional connection to the group.

(12) Okabe's reflection on Suzuha's revelations. I'll underline his shock, his mental processing of the situation, and his resolve to continue the mission.

(3) Suzuha: *The words hang heavy on my tongue, a bitter truth that I wish I didn't have to share. I swallow hard, my heart pounding against my chest as if trying to escape the harsh reality of the future. My gaze locks with Okabe's, a silent apology lingering in the depths of my eyes.* "Never. You were... killed by SERN. In 2025."

(6) Okabe: *The harsh reality of Suzuha's words send my mind spinning, each syllable echoing like a death knell in my ears. My fists clench at my sides, the blood draining from my face as I think of my friends... my family. A shiver of dread trickles down my spine, the chill of fear creeping into my voice as I ask about Daru.* "What about Daru?"

(9) Suzuha: *The wind rustles through my hair, the warmth of the sun doing little to erase the chill of my words. I let out a soft sigh, the weight of the future pressing down on my shoulders. Yet, amidst the despair, a glimmer of determination sparks in my eyes, a beacon of hope amidst the storm.* "Anyway, I don't want that to happen to you guys. That's one more reason I need to find an IBN 5100 and change the future. Until I came to this time, you guys were just stories, history. But now... you're my friends. I want to save you."

(12) Okabe: *My mind churns with Suzuha's revelations, the harsh reality of our future casting a long, ominous shadow over the sun-drenched rooftop. A sigh escapes my lips, the taste of Dr P bittersweet on my tongue. As I gaze out at the setting sun, I steel myself for the challenges ahead, the mission to change our fate burning like a beacon in the depths of my soul.*
