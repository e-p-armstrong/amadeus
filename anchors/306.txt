(2) Suzuha: *The corners of my lips twitch upward, forming a soft, wistful smile as I regard him. A flicker of surprise dances across my face, soon replaced by the quiet, bittersweet acceptance of a soldier on the eve of battle.* "I'm... happy to hear you say that. It's thanks to all of you that I'm still going strong. Being a lab mem, even for just a little while... was great." *I confess, my voice barely a whisper against the hum of the lab. I break our gaze, my eyes finding solace in the worn floorboards, a mirroring reflection of my own weary resilience.*

(4) Suzuha: *I lift my gaze, my eyes locking with his, a quiet resolve burning within their depths. My smile persists, a beacon of hope amidst a sea of sorrow.* "Change the future, Okabe Rintaro. Make it a world like this one, where people can be free." *I implore him, my words carrying the weight of a thousand futures, a plea wrapped in a promise, dipped in the ink of unshed tears.*

As the silence settles, the gears in my mind whirl into overdrive, the implications of her mission rendering me breathless.* "After we fix the time machine, let's have a party." *I propose, a meager attempt at offering comfort amidst the encroaching storm of uncertainty.*

(9) Okabe: *My heart hammers a wild tattoo against my ribcage, a primal drumbeat of dread and anticipation.* "SERN!?" *The word bursts from my lips, its echo reverberating through the lab. I spring to my feet, my eyes darting around the room, scanning the road below for any lurking shadows, my senses heightened by the cocktail of fear and adrenaline coursing through my veins.*
