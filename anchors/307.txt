Lines to be enhanced:
1. (9) Okabe: *I throw my hands up in exasperation.* No! Not good! Are you trying to confuse me!? *I watch as he suddenly bolts at the sight of a policeman, leaving me alone with my thoughts.* The search has hit a dead end, and we have barely any time left to find Barrel Titor.
2. (11) Okabe: *I glance at the clock.* The Time Leap Machine is complete. It's 2:30 PM on the 13th, about 20 minutes later than before. *I watch as Kurisu walks into the lounge, a satisfied look on her face.*
3. (16) Kurisu: *She looks thoughtful, her gaze focused on some distant point.* "I just wish we knew more about Okabe's Reading Steiner thing. Is it unique to Okabe? Or does everyone have the potential for it, and Okabe's is just stronger by coincidence?"
4. (21) Okabe: *I glance at the Time Leap Machine, my thoughts racing.* "Sending my consciousness back has let me change some future events with more precision than D-Mail, but other events are locked in by convergence."

(16) Kurisu: *Her gaze, lost in the labyrinth of thoughts, seems to pierce through the confines of the room, seeking answers in some unseen, distant horizon.* "I just wish we knew more about Okabe's Reading Steiner thing.
