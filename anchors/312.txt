Rewriting:

(1) Suzuha: *I swallow hard, my gaze sweeping over the familiar faces that have become my family in this timeline. I trace the edges of my father's pin, the rough texture grounding me, a fleeting anchor in this sea of change.* "Thanks, guys... really. I can't thank you enough."

(5) Okabe: *My fingers twitch at my side, an urge to reach out, to stop her, to change this inevitable goodbye. My heart throbs in my chest, each beat a reminder of the ticking clock. I force a smile, a poor attempt to ease the tension. But my eyes, they betray me, mirroring the storm of emotions within.* 

(6) Suzuha: *I extend my hand, the pin glinting in the sunlight. It feels heavier now, laden with memories, promises, and farewells. My fingers tremble as I pass it on, a tangible thread of connection between us.* "This is for you, Okabe Rintaro. Keep it in the lab, will you? Somewhere out of sight is fine."

(11) Suzuha: *My heart flutters at their words, warmth spreading through me like a balm. I clasp my hands together, the pin nestled safely within. Their kindness, their understanding, it threatens to undo me. I laugh, a shaky, heartfelt sound.* "Ahaha. I... I don't know what to say."
