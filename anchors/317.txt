Based on the characters' personalities and the scene's context, I have chosen the following lines to enhance:

(3) Itaru: *I stagger back as if hit, my eyes widening in shock.* "Y-you mean I could have great-grandkids? I don't know if I'm ready for that, man..."

(6) Okabe: *Suddenly, a knock on the door cuts through our idle chatter. Everyone's eyes turn to me. With a strange mixture of anticipation and anxiety, I slowly reach out and turn the doorknob.*

(13) Okabe: *I run a hand through my hair, struggling to keep my face neutral.* "She said she went back to her hometown. She's probably gone for good."

(15) Okabe: *Watching Tennouji's reaction, I can't help but feel a spark of hope. The future is changing. Isn't this proof?*

The reasons for my choices are as follows:

(3) Itaru: This line captures Daru's bewilderment and anxiety about the strange situation he finds himself in. By enhancing this line, I can convey more of his personality and the emotional complexity of his situation.

(6) Okabe: This line serves as a turning point in the scene, where the lab members' idle chatter is interrupted by an unexpected visit. Enhancing this line will build up the suspense and anticipation in the scene.

(13) Okabe: In this line, Okabe is lying to Tennouji about Suzuha's whereabouts. I can use this opportunity to delve into Okabe's internal struggle as he lies to his landlord.

(15) Okabe: This line reveals Okabe's hope and optimism about the future. Enhancing this line will allow me to explore his character's depth and his hopes for the future.

Now, I will proceed to enhance the selected lines:

(3) Itaru: *The words hit me like a punch to the gut, sending a shockwave through my system. My heart hammers in my chest as I reel from the implications, my eyes widening in disbelief.* "Y-you mean I could have great-grandkids? I... I don't know if I'm ready for that, man..." *The reality of the situation begins to sink in, the surreal nature of time travel tangling my thoughts into knots of confusion and apprehension.*

(6) Okabe: *The sudden knock on the door slices through our idle chatter like a knife, causing a hush to fall over the room. All eyes turn to me, their gazes heavy with a mix of anticipation and anxiety that mirrors my own. With a shaky breath, I reach out, my hand hovering over the doorknob for a moment before I muster the courage to turn it.*

(13) Okabe: *I run a hand through my hair, the strands slipping through my fingers as I grapple with the lie on the tip of my tongue. It feels like sandpaper against my conscience, grating and coarse.* "She said she went back to her hometown. She's probably gone for good." *The words tumble out, each one heavy with the weight of the truth I'm concealing.*

(15) Okabe: *As I watch Tennouji's reaction, a spark of hope flickers in the depths of my chest, casting a warm glow against the cold dread that has nestled there. The future is shifting, turning on its axis, and for the first time, I dare to believe that we might be able to change it.* "Isn't this proof?" *I murmur to myself, the words a whispered prayer in the silence of my thoughts.*
