Characters involved:
1. Okabe Rintaro: The protagonist and the leader of the Future Gadget Laboratory. He's eccentric, often paranoid, and uses grandiose speech, referring to himself in the third person as Hououin Kyouma. Okabe is highly intelligent and a natural-born scientist, always curious and driven to understand the world around him. His actions and thoughts will be filled with tension, determination, and a hint of madness.
2. Tennouji Yuugo (Mr. Braun): The landlord of the building where the Future Gadget Laboratory is located. He is a tough, intimidating, and somewhat gruff character. His lines will be simple and straightforward, reflecting his down-to-earth personality.

Lines chosen for embellishment:
1. (3) Okabe: *My heart skips a beat, the words hitting me like a freight train.* "Passed away!?" *A wave of dizziness nearly sweeps me off my feet as the weight of the revelation sinks in. I swallow hard, forcing myself to ask the next question despite the lump in my throat.* "...How old was she?"
2. (5) Okabe: *A bitter laugh escapes me, the irony not lost on me.* "Thank you for taking care of this letter, Mister Braun."
3. (8) Okabe: *I glance at Tennouji, who clearly doesn't understand our reaction, and we're not about to explain. I thank him again. He grumbles a bit and leaves. As soon as he's gone, I break the seal and open the envelope. Inside is a handwritten letter. The characters are slightly messy, as if her hand was shaking as she wrote it. Our eyes, transfixed, begin to read.*
4. (12) Okabe: *Each 'I failed' is a punch to the gut, Suzuha's despair resonating in the depths of my soul, the gravity of her failure weighing heavily on my heart.*

Enhanced lines:
1. (3) Okabe: *The world around me seems to tilt on its axis, my heart caught in a vice as Tennouji's words, sharp as a dagger, pierce through the fog of my disbelief.* "Passed away!?" *I reel, the room spinning as the magnitude of his words crashes over me, a tidal wave of sorrow and regret. I steady myself, the taste of iron heavy on my tongue, my voice barely more than a whisper as I dare to ask,* "...How old was she?"
2. (5) Okabe: *A hollow, bitter laughter bubbles up from the abyss within me, the edges of my vision blurring as the cruel twist of fate unveils itself.* "Thank you for taking care of this letter, Mister Braun." *I manage to choke out through the haze of my disbelief, my words a thin veil for the torrent of emotions threatening to consume me.*
3. (8) Okabe: *I steal a fleeting glance at Tennouji, his confusion evident, yet our secrets remain ours. With a murmured word of gratitude, I watch as he departs, his retreating figure a fading specter in the dim light. No sooner has the door closed behind him than I find myself reaching for the envelope. I break the seal with trembling fingers, my heart pounding in sync with the deafening silence of the lab. As I unfold the letter, the characters dance before my eyes, their jagged, uneven strokes a testament to the trembling hand that penned them. And then, I begin to read...*
4. (12) Okabe: *With each 'I failed', I feel an icy fist clench tighter around my heart, the echoes of Suzuha's despair reverberating through the confines of my soul. The walls of the lab seem to close in on me, the weight of her failure pressing down on me, a suffocating blanket of regret and sorrow. I'm left gasping for breath, her despair a haunting melody that plays on an endless loop within the confines of my mind.*
