Brainstorming:

The characters involved are Okabe, Itaru (Daru), Kurisu, and Tennouji (Mister Braun).

Okabe is passionate and animated, driven by his desire to change the past and save his friends. He's feeling anger, despair, and a sense of urgency. His actions and thoughts should be intense and expressive.

Itaru is a talented hacker, but a bit socially awkward. He's grappling with guilt over his mistake. His actions and thoughts should be nervous and regretful.

Kurisu is a calm and composed scientist, trying to mediate the situation. Her actions and thoughts should be steady and rational.

Tennouji is a friendly yet somewhat gruff older man. His actions and thoughts should be straightforward and practical.

The selected lines to rewrite and enhance are:

(1) Okabe: "Daru... didn't you fix the time machine?"
(3) Okabe: "Missed something!? Whatever you missed cost your daughter 24 years of her life!"
(5) Kurisu: "Calm down, both of you. Hashida did everything he could. He doesn't deserve your anger, Okabe."
(8) Okabe: "Gh..." "Mister Braun!"

(1) Okabe: *The words erupt from my chest, sharp and accusatory, as if they can somehow change the harsh reality we're facing.* "Daru... didn't you fix the time machine?" *My hands ball into fists at my sides, my knuckles white against the dark room, the weight of our failed experiment heavy in the air around us.*

(3) Okabe: *My voice rises, a tempest of frustration and fear, each word a thunderclap echoing in the room.* "Missed something!? Whatever you missed cost your daughter 24 years of her life!" *My gaze bores into Daru, the harsh reality of our actions laid bare.*

(5) Kurisu: *I step forward, my voice a steady beacon in the storm of emotions swirling around us.* "Calm down, both of you. Hashida did everything he could. He doesn't deserve your anger, Okabe." *My gaze shifts from Okabe to Daru, my words a lifeline thrown into the turbulent waters of their confrontation.*

(8) Okabe: *A low growl vibrates in my throat, the sound a raw testament to my frustration.* "Gh..." *My fists clench tighter, the tendons in my hand straining against the skin. I whirl around, my gaze landing on the familiar figure of Mister Braun outside.* "Mister Braun!" *My voice pierces the tension-filled room, the urgency in my words propelling me towards the door.*
