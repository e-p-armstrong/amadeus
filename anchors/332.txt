(1) Okabe: *As the bald man and his lackeys bristle at my words, I feel a shiver of danger creep up my spine. I take in the hostile glares, the clenched fists, the tension in the air, and decide that discretion is the better part of valor. With a nod and a wave, I excuse myself, leaving them in my wake. My mind is a whirlwind of thoughts and worries as I navigate the labyrinthine streets of the city, my heart pounding in sync with the rhythmic thrum of life around me. I stop by the assembly hall, pestering the staff with my inquiries about Faris, but my efforts yield nothing. With a frustrated sigh, I pull out my phone and dial Daru's number, only to be met with disappointment lacing his voice.* "Maybe she went home already?" *The possibility sends a fresh wave of anxiety through me. I return to Faris's apartment building, my fingers hovering over the intercom, a knot of apprehension tightening in my stomach.*

(5) Okabe: *A glimmer of hope ignites in my chest as the intercom goes silent. I hold my breath, the seconds stretching into an eternity as I wait for the response. Then, with a mechanical click, the door's automatic lock disengages, granting me access to the elevator hall. Relief washes over me, its soothing balm easing the tension in my shoulders. I step inside, the cool air of the building enveloping me, a stark contrast to the city's relentless heat. The elevator ride is a blur, my thoughts consumed with Faris and the task at hand.*

(7) Okabe: *As the apartment door swings open, I'm greeted by a sight that hits me like a sledgehammer. There, sitting on the sofa, is Faris, hugging her knees close to her chest. Her usual vibrant energy, her infectious laughter, her cat-like playfulness â€“ all of it is replaced by an unsettling stillness. Her eyes, once bright and full of life, now stare blankly at the floor, lost and distant.* "Faris! Finally. There's something I need to ask you."

(11) Okabe: *Her words, so unlike the cheerful banter I'm used to, hit me like a punch to the gut. The reality of her distress sinks in, the weight of it threatening to pull me under. But I don't have the luxury of time. I shake off the creeping despair, steeling myself for what I need to do.* "Listen, Faris!" *I step forward, reaching out to grip her shoulders. Her eyes blink open, but they're glazed over, the spark in them reduced to mere embers.* "A couple of days ago, you used the time machine we invented to send a D-Mail. Do you remember that?"
