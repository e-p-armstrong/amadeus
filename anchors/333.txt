Rewriting:

(1) Okabe: *Her sudden closeness throws me off balance. The warmth of her body seeping through our clothes, her heartbeat throbbing against my chest, her soft breaths tickling my skin - it's too much, too sudden. The faint scent of her shampoo, mixed with a hint of something uniquely hers, invades my nostrils, grounding me in the reality of the moment. A glance at her eyes, usually sparkling with mischief, now shimmering with desperation, tightens a knot in my stomach.* "W-whoa! What!?"

(10) Faris: *She nods, her eyes glazed over as if she's looking past me, into the murky depths of her memory. Her voice takes on a dreamy quality, the confusion and fear in her eyes replaced by a childlike curiosity.* "Umm, Faris got on the time machine and it went zoom and..."

(15) Okabe: *A knot of confusion and concern twists in my stomach, my mind racing to piece together the puzzle of her words. The cold, hard facts contradict her memories, creating a whirlpool of uncertainty. I run a hand through my hair, a feeble attempt to anchor myself in the midst of this chaos.* "What's going on here?"

(28) Faris: *She buries her face deeper into my chest, her sobs sending tremors through her body. Each word she utters, muffled by the fabric of my shirt, is like a dagger to my heart. The playful Faris I know is nowhere to be found, replaced by this vulnerable girl clinging to me for support.* "Even though Faris is trying her bestest to remember for you... You called me a liar... it hurts, nyan."
