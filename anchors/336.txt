(1) Okabe: *My heartbeat becomes an insistent drum in my ears, each throb demanding attention, as if trying to impart the urgency of my plea. I feel my voice rise, climbing an octave higher, resonating with a desperate plea for comprehension.* "Are you listening!?" *My fingers instinctively find their way to Faris's shoulders, the slender frame trembling under my touch like a frightened kitten. Her scent of vanilla and strawberries fills my nostrils, a stark contrast to the gravity of my words.* "Faris?"

(5) Okabe: *A sharp, stabbing pain shoots through my shin, a quick and cruel reminder of Faris's refusal to hear me out. I wince, grinding my teeth against the surge of discomfort, the taste of blood mingling with the bitterness of frustration on my tongue.* "Hgg...!" *As she turns her back to me, her silhouette a defiant challenge in the harsh city lights, a surge of desperation wells up in my chest.* "W-wait! I said wait! I need you to win, no matter what!"

(7) Okabe: *I feel a knot of dread tighten in my stomach as I see her start to move away, her lithe form disappearing into the crowd. It's a race against time, and I can't afford to lose her, not now.* "Please hear me out!" *Ignoring the throbbing pain in my shin, I force myself in front of her, my desperation mirrored in the wide, terrified eyes that meet mine.* "Faris, please." *The words catch in my throat, a plea hanging in the air between us, as heavy as a death sentence.* "Mayuri's life depends on it!"

(9) 4℃: *As the crowd begins to gather, curiosity piqued by the spectacle, I make my entrance. Each step I take resonates with the chiming of my silver accessories, a symphony of sound that announces my arrival.* "You seem to have an awful lot of time on your hands. Eh, Champion?" *I remove my sunglasses with a dramatic flourish, the world around me bathed in a new light as my gaze meets theirs.* "Heh. Swooping down unto the street, I am the black peacock of the RaiNetter realm. The name's 4℃. That's Shido, you get me? I'm the leader of the Viral Attackers."
