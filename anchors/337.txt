## Brainstorming/Planning

Characters involved:

1. Faris: Eccentric, quirky, and playful. She often uses cat mannerisms and is generally nonchalant. Her actions will reflect her whimsical nature and aloofness. I will use imaginative and playful language to mirror her unique persona.

2. Okabe: Desperate, passionate, and assertive. He is usually intense and dramatic, often displaying a sense of urgency. His actions will be described in a way that reflects his desperation and determination. I will utilize strong, fervent language to mirror his persona.

3. 4℃: Proud, assertive, and slightly absurd. He has a somewhat inflated sense of self-importance and likes to boast about his status in the "RaiNet realm". His actions will reflect his pride and self-righteousness. I will use grandiose and exaggerated language to mirror his persona.

Lines to enhance:

(1) Faris: *I swish my imaginary tail, annoyance flickering in my eyes as I mimic the pout of a displeased cat.* "Why is everyone getting in Faris's way, nya? I can't hear myself think, nya!"

(4) Okabe: *My eyes plead with her, my hands reaching out in a futile attempt to convey the urgency of my words.* "I'm begging you, please listen to what I'm saying!"

(7) 4℃: *I bristle at his dismissal, my fists clenching at my sides as I take a step closer to him.* "The hell you say! Don't you know I'm the black nobleman of the RaiNet realm!?"

(10) Okabe: *I glance at the promotional posters adorning the walls, their blue and white motif standing in stark contrast to 4℃'s claim.* "Oh, I get it. You just like to say 'black.'"

Thematic direction: I will highlight the tension and absurdity of the scene, emphasizing the desperation of Okabe, the playful aloofness of Faris, and the self-importance of 4℃.

## Writing

(1) Faris: *With an elaborate flourish, I swish an imaginary tail, an air of whimsy lending grace to my movements. Annoyance flickers in my eyes, twinkling like distant stars against the velvet of a night sky, as I embody the essence of a displeased cat. My lips curve into a playful pout, a silent protest against the cacophony that is drowning out my thoughts.* "Why is everyone getting in Faris's way, nya? I can't hear myself think, nya!"

(4) Okabe: *My hands reach out in a desperate plea, fingers grasping at the empty air between us as if it were the last lifeline in a turbulent sea. My eyes, awash with a mix of frustration and desperation, implore her for understanding, the intensity of my gaze attempting to bridge the chasm that words alone could not. My voice, heavy with urgency, treads the fine line between a plea and a command.* "I'm begging you, please listen to what I'm saying!"

(7) 4℃: *A surge of indignation courses through me, stoking the fire of my pride into a blazing inferno. My fists clench at my sides, each muscle coiling like a spring ready to unleash its pent-up energy. I take a defiant step closer to him, my posture echoing the grandeur of a nobleman defending his realm.* "The hell you say! Don't you know I'm the black nobleman of the RaiNet realm!?"

(10) Okabe: *My gaze drifts towards the promotional posters adorning the walls, their vibrant hues of blue and white standing in stark contrast to 4℃'s claim. I feel a dry chuckle bubble up from my chest, its sound echoing the absurdity of the situation. The irony does not escape me: the man who claims black as his symbol, standing amidst a sea of blue and white.* "Oh, I get it. You just like to say 'black.'"
