Character Personalities:

1. Okabe: Eccentric, dramatic, witty and determined. He is a self-proclaimed mad scientist who often uses theatrical speech and actions. Okabe's actions would be grand, almost exaggerated, and his thoughts would be strategic and analytical.

2. 4℃ (Shido): Proud, temperamental, easily provoked. He can be overly reactive, often responding with anger and threats when provoked. His actions would be expressive, filled with tension, and his thoughts would be defensive and prideful.

3. Faris: Friendly, playful, naive. She is known for speaking in a cat-like manner and is generally carefree and cheerful. Her actions would be curious and innocent, and her thoughts would be cautious yet trusting.

Just you wait!" *With a final glare, I stomp away, the sting of embarrassment still fresh in my mind.*
