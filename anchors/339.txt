Enhanced Lines:
1. (1) Itaru: *With a fiery passion igniting my eyes, I thrust my fists into the air, each punch slicing through the electrifying atmosphere. My voice erupts from the depths of my chest, a booming declaration that resounds over the cacophony of the crowd.* "You gotta cheer for Faris-tan too!"

2. (7) Okabe: *I find myself caught in the dazzling display of flashing cameras, each burst of light painting fleeting shadows across the sea of faces. I watch as they illuminate the hall, a symphony of light and sound, all vying for a single moment with the adored catgirl. It's a spectacle that leaves me speechless.*

3. (14) Itaru: *I turn to Okabe, my eyes gleaming with pride and admiration. Each word that escapes my lips is a testament to Faris's strength, a ballad of her unmatched skill.* "In this tournament, duels take place between two-man teams. But since there's nobody strong enough to be Faris-tan's duel partner, she goes alone. Two heads are obviously better than one, but Faris can win despite her handicap! That's why I love her!"

4. (16) Itaru: *I shrug, my eyes clouding over as I delve into the realm of uncertainty. The Viral Attackers are a mystery, a shadow lurking in the corners of the tournament. Their reputation is one of aggression, but the specifics elude me.* "Hmm. I don't know all the details, but apparently they're a pretty aggressive team. But other than that, there's a bunch of suspicious rumors about them. They've got a lot of followers, you see. And apparently, they don't mind using those followers to interfere with their opponents during duels. About half the teams they faced in the championships were no-shows. And that's not all. Apparently, they even go around beating up otaku in Akiba and Ikebukuro. Long story short, RaiNetters really hate them."
