Planning and Brainstorming:

Characters and their personalities:

1. Itaru: An otaku and hacker who is passionate about games and anime. His speech is often filled with references and enthusiasm about his interests. He is a supportive friend but can be a bit oblivious at times.

2. Okabe: A self-proclaimed mad scientist with a dramatic flair. He is serious, intelligent, and has a tendency to get deeply involved in what he's doing. He is protective of his friends and has a strong sense of justice.

3. 4â„ƒ: A taunting and arrogant opponent who enjoys belittling others. He has a flamboyant way of speaking and takes pleasure in creating a show.

Considering these personalities, I will choose lines that allow me to highlight these character traits while also adding tension and emotion to the scene.

The lines I choose to enhance as anchors are:

- (3) Itaru: In this line, I can express Itaru's deep understanding of the game and his surprise at Faris's unexpected move. This will highlight his passion for the game and his close observation of Faris's playing style.

- (9) Okabe: This line allows me to show Okabe's protective nature and his attention to detail. I can enhance the sense of tension and urgency in the scene.

- (12) Itaru: This line allows me to emphasize Itaru's concern for Faris and his frustration with the Virals. I can also hint at his knowledge of the game's strategies.

- (14) Itaru: In this line, I can express Itaru's frustration and his understanding of the sneaky tactics used in the game.

Rewritten Anchors:

(3) Itaru: *I blink, my breath hitching in my throat as my gaze remains locked on the screen, the fluorescent light casting an eerie glow on my transfixed expression.* "I can't believe it," *I whisper, the words tumbling out in a rush, my fingers instinctively curling around the edge of the table. My heart pounds with a mixture of excitement and disbelief, the unexpected development in the game throwing my predictions off balance.* "She took a Virus Card... She almost never goes on the offensive. Maybe the Virals are enough of a threat to warrant a change of strategy."

(9) Okabe: *My gaze shifts to Faris, my pulse quickening as a flicker of red light dances near her eyes.* "A laser!" *I burst out, my voice echoing in the tense silence. My finger points towards her, my hand trembling with a surge of adrenaline. The realization hits me like a punch to the gut, the stakes of the game suddenly rising to a whole new level.*

(12) Itaru: *My eyes squint at the screen, my heart pounding like a drum in my chest.* "Seriously?" *I murmur, my voice barely audible over the hum of the crowd. My mind races, thoughts whirling in a chaotic dance as I try to comprehend the possible sabotage. A sense of dread settles in my stomach, a grim reminder of the harsh reality of the game.*

(14) Itaru: *I shrug, my lips pressing into a thin line as a wave of frustration washes over me.* "They must be timing it so that the referee doesn't see," *I say, my voice laced with bitterness. My hands clench into fists, the unfairness of the situation gnawing at me. The game that I love so much, tainted by the deceitful tactics of the Virals.*
