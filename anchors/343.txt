# Writing

(1) Okabe: *My gaze fixes on Faris, my heart hammering a rhythm of worry in the hollow of my chest. Her silence is an anomaly in our usual camaraderie, a stark contrast to the playful banter we often share. I've done my part, cleared the interference, hoping that it would bring back the Faris I know. But she remains a statue, her face a mask of concentration that sends a shiver of unease down my spine.* "What!?" *The word explodes from me as she averts her gaze, her eyes distant and troubled. A wave of panic engulfs me, my thoughts spiralling into a whirlpool of fear. Is it another laser? Is she in danger?*

(2) 4℃: *A cruel smirk paints itself on my face, my voice dripping with mockery as I weave my web of chaos.* "Hey, Champion. They say your eyes can see into a man's soul. They say you have the power to read minds, which makes you a cheater even my pure black evil heart can't abide." *My words hang in the air, a poisonous cloud that taints the atmosphere with suspicion and doubt. I revel in the turmoil I'm causing, the conflict feeding the flame of my victory.*

(5) Okabe: *A surge of protectiveness claws its way up my chest, a primal instinct to shield Faris from the storm of accusations. My heart pounds a fierce tattoo against my ribs, each beat echoing the urgency of the situation.* "Faris!" *My voice rings out, a beacon in the silent room, a plea for her to fight back.*

(8) Faris: *I finally break my silence, my voice a barely audible whisper that brushes against the tension-filled air. My gaze remains averted, a shield against the prying eyes that seek to unravel me.* "...ctory" *With a soft, almost defiant smile, I lift my gaze to meet Okabe's, my determination burning bright in the depths of my eyes.* "...I use Change Directory. Nya."
