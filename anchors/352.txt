Enhanced Lines:

(7) Okabe: *I feel the familiar flutter of adrenaline in my veins, a mad symphony of fear and resolve playing in my chest. I draw in a deep, shaky breath, my body bracing for the imminent onslaught.* "Very well... then prepare yourselves! Releasing restriction si--" *The words barely escape my lips when 4℃ lands a swift kick in my solar plexus, cutting me off like an abrupt end to a melody.* "Gweh..."

(9) Okabe: *4℃'s hand clamps around the top of my head, his grip a vice of malice and power. The world spins as I'm jerked forward, each knee strike a brutal punctuation in this cruel sentence. Finally, he lets go, releasing me to gravity's mercy. I hit the ground, each cough a plea for mercy as 4℃ starts laying into me with a fury of kicks, each one a thunderclap of pain.*

(15) Okabe: *I feel myself recede, the world blurring as a tidal wave of agony crashes over me. Each punch, each kick, each jeering laugh becomes a distant echo. I retreat into myself, my consciousness a tiny island in a sea of torment. There is no thought, no resistance, only the ebb and flow of pain.*

(20) Okabe: *Suddenly, the cacophony is punctuated by the guttural growl of a car's exhaust. A limousine cuts a swath through the chaos, barreling into the alleyway like a bullet. The scent of burnt rubber fills the air, a bitter testament to the urgency of its arrival. The limousine skids to a halt, tire tracks etched into the asphalt like a promise of salvation. The back door swings open, a dark gateway to safety.*
