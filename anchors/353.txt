Enhanced Lines:

(1) Okabe: *I swallow hard, the bitter taste of regret creeping up my throat, the memory of my failure wrapping around me like a vice. Shadows of the past cast a pall over my soul, their ghostly whispers echoing in the hollow chambers of my heart.* "I wasn't able to do anything against those guys. I was pathetic..."

(4) Okabe: *A pang of guilt stabs through me, a sharp reminder of our conversation at the ramen shop. The words, like shards of broken glass, embed themselves in my conscience, each syllable a painful echo of the wish I had granted.* "The wish Faris made... ...was to save Papa, who died ten years ago, nya."

(5) Faris’s Dad: *His eyes, soft pools of affection, rest upon his daughter, a smile, gentle as a summer breeze, gracing his face. The bond they share, as tangible as the air around us, cloaks the room with warmth, his love for her a beacon that cuts through the gloom.* "I always keep my promises to you, Rumiho. I made that decision long ago."

(10) Okabe: *My heart lurches at his words, the steady rhythm disrupted by a sudden surge of hope. It's a lifeline thrown into the turbulent seas of my despair, the mere possibility of a solution igniting a spark in the darkest corners of my mind.* "You... gave it away?"
