Brainstorming:

1) Faris's Dad: He's a loving father who has regrets and carries a heavy burden. His actions will be filled with remorse, a sense of responsibility, and a weariness that comes from many years of guilt.

3) Faris's Dad: This line will carry the weight of his confession, the regret, and the relief of finally sharing this burden. His actions will reflect the heaviness of the past and the hope for a better future.

7) Okabe: He's a mad scientist, a leader, and a protector. His actions will reflect his guilt, frustration, and determination to set things right.

10) Faris: She's a lively, cheerful girl with a hidden past. Her actions will reflect her vulnerability, gratitude, and an underlying sadness.

Enhanced lines:

(1) Faris's Dad: *A sigh escapes from my lips as I shake my head, the burden of regret settling heavily on my shoulders. The memory of my decision, made in a moment of desperation, haunts me. Each word feels like a stone in my heart, sinking deeper with every beat.* "I don't think Hashida-san, who entrusted the IBN 5100 to me, could ever forgive me for what I did..."

(3) Faris's Dad: *The past unfurls before my eyes, an old wound reopened. A ghost of a smile plays on my lips as I remember my little Rumiho, innocent and helpless. A shudder runs through me as I recall the cold fear that gripped my heart, the unbearable weight of the decision I had to make.* "This is an old story... a story from before my company got as big as it is. Rumiho was kidnapped. The kidnapper demanded an unthinkable ransom. Maybe I should have mortgaged the company instead. But at that moment, someone appeared, like a godsend, offering a large sum of money to buy my IBN 5100. I sold it, which gave me enough to prepare Rumiho's ransom."

(7) Okabe: *Conflicting thoughts whirl in my mind as I shake my head. The weight of my decision settles heavily on my chest, the bitter taste of regret lingering on my tongue. My fist clenches and unclenches, mirroring the turmoil within me. My gaze lands on the door, my eyes heavy with the weight of unshed tears.* "No, thank you. That won't be necessary." *I pause, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Oh, Faris. Still awake?"

(10) Faris: *My heart flutters in my chest as I sit down, a faint blush coloring my cheeks. My fingers twine together in my lap, a silent plea for comfort. The memory of the chase, the fear, the relief, they all come rushing back. I take a deep breath, steeling myself for the words I'm about to say.* "...Um. Thanks for earlier. When the Viral gang started chasing me, I was really scared."
