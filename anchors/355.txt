Planning and Brainstorming:

This scene is emotionally loaded, and it's important to keep the characters' personalities intact. Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, whose dramatic flair often masks his compassion and sensitivity. He's thrown off by the sudden emotional vulnerability from Faris, a usually playful and cheerful character. Faris is presenting her true self, Rumiho, who carries the weight of her father's tragic death and the guilt of her harsh last words to him. Her playful façade slips away, revealing her profound sadness and gratitude towards Okabe.

Lines to be enhanced:

(3) Okabe: *I blink in surprise, my gaze fixating on her. The person sitting in front of me isn't a cat-eared maid, and she isn't the RaiNet Champion. She's just a normal girl... Wh-what?*

(8) Faris: *She sighs, her shoulders dropping slightly, her gaze falling to her lap.* "Anyway, Kyouma, I can't thank you enough. Thank you, honestly... You know, Kyouma... You're my prince."

(12) Faris: "I want you to call me Rumiho."

(20) Faris: *Her voice breaks, and I can see the tears glistening in her eyes.* "I couldn't believe the world would be so cruel to me. 'I hate you, Papa! You should just die!' Those were the last words I ever said to him. ...And that's how our relationship ended, forever."

Rewritten lines:

(3) Okabe: *My eyes widen in disbelief, my gaze glued to the unfamiliar sight before me. The playful, cat-eared maid, the undefeated RaiNet Champion, they seem to dissolve into the air, leaving behind a girl, a normal girl, raw and vulnerable. It's as if I've been pulled into an alternate reality, where everything is familiar yet unsettlingly different. What's happening?*

(8) Faris: *With a sigh that seems to drain the life out of her, her shoulders slump, and her eyes lose their spark, falling to her lap.* "Anyway, Kyouma, I can't thank you enough. Thank you, honestly... You know, Kyouma... You're my prince." *Her voice is barely a whisper, each word laden with a sadness that tugs at my heartstrings. She speaks my name, not with the usual playful lilt but with a reverence that catches me off guard.*

(12) Faris: *She looks up at me, her eyes reflecting a desperate plea.* "I want you to call me Rumiho." *Her voice is so soft it's almost lost in the stillness of the room. Her name, Rumiho, hangs in the air, a ghostly echo of a girl hidden behind a playful façade, a girl longing to be seen, to be acknowledged.*

(20) Faris: *Her voice cracks, a dam breaking, and I see the glint of tears in her eyes, each one carrying the weight of her pain.* "I couldn't believe the world would be so cruel to me. 'I hate you, Papa! You should just die!' Those were the last words I ever said to him. ...And that's how our relationship ended, forever." *Her confession is a dagger to my heart, the raw emotion in her words painting a picture of a tragedy that's too cruel to bear.*
