Lines to be enhanced:
1. (1) Faris: "I loved him... so why? Why did I say those things to him? I always felt guilty because of what I said. I always wished I could go back in time... change what happened."
2. (5) Faris: "No. Let me finish. I'm okay now. Papa came to save me... so I know how much he really loves me. I really enjoyed having this time to spend with him. It was like a gift to us from heaven. But now you need to change things back to the way they were."
3. (11) Faris: "A-actually... I'm not okay at all... I remember how things were before the world changed... But I also remember how everything was after the world changed, you know? I'm actually kind of freaking out right now. What happened before the change and after the change are all mixed up inside me. I don't know which one is real anymore. But if I try to fight it, it'll just make you sad, won't it? I don't want to make you sad. You are my prince, after all."
4. (15) Faris: "Hey, is it okay if I cry a little? Before we change things back, is it okay... if I cry for Papa?"

What happened before the change and after the change are all mixed up inside me. I don't know which one is real anymore. But if I try to fight it, it'll just make you sad, won't it?
