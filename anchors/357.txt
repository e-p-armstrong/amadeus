Enhanced lines:

(1) Okabe: *I gaze at Faris, her face still luminous in the dim light, wet trails from fallen tears carving paths down her cheeks. The sadness in her eyes is mirrored in my own, a silent testament to the heavy decision we're about to make.* "Faris..."

(4) Faris: *I linger at the threshold, my hand resting lightly on the worn knob, feeling the cold metal seep into my skin. I steal a glance back at Okabe, my heart aching for the burden he carries.* "Let me be alone with Papa for a while, nya."

(5) Okabe: *I sink into the cold, unyielding chair, my gaze drawn to the intricate patterns on the worn floor. The oppressive silence of the room is broken only by the dull hum of the PhoneWave, its relentless rhythm a cruel reminder of our task. I navigate the digital interface, confirming the settings, my finger hovering above the send button like a guillotine above its victim, the weight of our decision bearing down on me.*

(10) Faris: *I delicately input the cancellation D-Mail, each press of a button sending a pang through my heart. The dread of losing the memories of a life so dearly cherished and the fear of a familiar world slipping away gnaw at my resolve.* "Um... when we change things back, will my memories of this world disappear, nya?"
