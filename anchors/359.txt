Planning:

1. Line (2) Okabe: "I'm sorry."
   - Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, often wearing a facade of confidence and eccentricity. However, beneath this front, he is deeply caring and burdened by guilt over the timeline alterations. I'll depict his inner turmoil and remorse through his actions, highlighting the heaviness of his heart and the difficulty he has in expressing his feelings. 

2. Line (3) Faris: "Kyouma? T-this is really bold of you, nya... Mayushii's in the next room. She'll find out, you know? Nyahaha..."
   - Faris is cheerful and lively, often using a playful "nya" in her speech. But beneath her bubbly exterior, she is intuitive and sensitive to her friends' emotions. I'll emphasize her surprise and confusion in response to Okabe's sudden embrace, whilst hinting at her underlying intuition.

3. Line (4) Okabe: "I'm sorry... They're back..."
   - This line is a pivotal moment for Okabe, as he confronts the reality of his actions. It's crucial to depict the immense grief and guilt he feels, the pain of the sacrifices made, and the haunting reminders of the timeline alterations.

4. Line (6) Okabe: "Lukako, someone should have donated an old computer to the shrine several years ago. Can you ask your dad about it for me?"
   - Okabe is trying to move forward, despite the weight of his guilt. This line should showcase his determination and focus, even when wrestling with the painful consequences of his decisions.

Enhanced Lines:

(2) Okabe: *Without warning, my hands reach out, pulling Faris into a tight embrace that feels like a futile attempt to hold onto a past that's fading fast. My heart feels heavy, like an anchor sinking into the abyss of regret, my voice a mere echo in the cavern of guilt.* "I'm sorry."

(3) Faris: *Caught off guard, I stiffen in his arms, a blush creeping onto my cheeks, the playful "nya" dying on my lips. A flurry of confusion swirls in my mind, my heart pounding a rhythm of surprise and curiosity.* "Kyouma? T-this is really bold of you, nya... Mayushii's in the next room. She'll find out, you know? Nyahaha..."

(4) Okabe: *With a sigh that feels like it's carrying the weight of the world, I release her from my grasp, my whispered apology hanging in the air like a ghost.* "I'm sorry..." *As I watch her walk away, I turn towards the cityscape, my heart sinking as I take in the sight of the familiar stores.* "They're back..." 

(6) Okabe: *I take a moment, my gaze meeting Luka's - a mirror reflecting my own turmoil. My voice is steady, a determined soldier marching through the battlefield of guilt and regret.* "Lukako, someone should have donated an old computer to the shrine several years ago. Can you ask your dad about it for me?"
