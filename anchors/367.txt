Planning:

Okabe is a complex character, torn between the need to save his friend Mayuri and his responsibilities as a scientist. His actions and thoughts should reflect his struggle, his desperation, and his deep-seated sense of responsibility. His words should be direct and straightforward, reflecting his determined and pragmatic nature. 

Kurisu, on the other hand, is a brilliant but emotionally guarded scientist. She's also clearly struggling with her feelings for Okabe. Her actions and thoughts should be subtler, hinting at her inner turmoil and her unspoken affection for Okabe. Her words should be careful and measured, reflecting her desire to maintain a professional demeanor despite her feelings.

I'll pick lines (2), (7), (11), and (16) as the "anchors". These lines are pivotal to the progression of the scene and contain significant emotional weight.

(2) Here, Kurisu is wrestling with her feelings for Okabe and her duty as a scientist. This line will serve as a testament to her internal struggle.

(7) This line shows Okabe's attempt to lighten the mood, and at the same time, subtly tease Kurisu about her feelings for him. I'll aim to convey his playful side and his underlying affection for Kurisu.

(11) Here, Okabe's desperation and frustration are at their peak. This line will serve to highlight his urgency and his unyielding determination to save Mayuri.

(16) This line shows Kurisu at her most vulnerable, suggesting a morally questionable course of action and expressing self-loathing as a result. I'll aim to capture her desperation and self-conflict.

(2) Kurisu: *I draw a shaky breath, my mind racing as I grapple with the unspoken tension between us. My finger taps rhythmically against my chin, an outward sign of my inner turmoil.* "Well, you tripped a romance flag, so... Hmm..." *My gaze flickers around the room, seeking refuge from the intensity of his gaze.* "...Ah!" *Heat floods my cheeks, a telltale sign of my discomfort. I turn away, my voice barely a whisper, as if afraid that speaking louder would shatter the fragile balance of our relationship.* "B-by the way, Okabe. Is there... someone you like? Wh-why aren't you answering?"

(7) Okabe: *I suppress a smirk, my eyes sparkling with mischief. The corners of my mouth twitch upwards as I prepare to poke fun at her.* "Why are you mad? Also, your face is red." *I chuckle, my laughter echoing in the tense air, a reminder of the fleeting moments of levity in our shared struggle.*

(11) Okabe: *I bite back a bitter laugh, my heart heavy with the weight of our situation.* "Mayuri dies in two days. I don't have time to play boyfriend." *I force the words out, my voice a harsh whisper, echoing the desperation clawing at my insides.*

(16) Kurisu: *A heavy silence settles over me, my heart pounding in my chest as I grapple with the words I'm about to utter.* "...Only consider this as a last resort. If you're willing to hurt Urushibara-san, you can always take the information by force. She'll forget after the worldline changes, won't she? In that case, I think it's a valid option. But only when compared to Mayuri's death." *My voice trembles, each word a testament to my self-loathing.* "I hate myself for suggesting this."
