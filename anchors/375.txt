Enhanced Lines:

(1) Kurisu: *I steady my gaze, focusing on Okabe as I cross my arms over my chest. The neon lights of Akihabara cast a soft glow on his face, highlighting the creases formed by worry and determination.* "You made this choice to save Mayuri. So I'll change my way of thinking too. Anyway, do you have any plans for your date tomorrow?"

(4) Okabe: *Summoning a spark of my usual theatrics, I straighten my back, my fingers curling into a fist as I thrust it into the air. The world around us seems to blur, the hustle and bustle of Akihabara fading into insignificance as I focus on my role.* "...I have only one thing to say, assistant mine. I am the great Hououin Kyouma, a mad scientist with an IQ rivaling that of Isaac Newton himself!"

(7) Kurisu: *A bubble of laughter escapes my lips before I can clamp it down. It's a rare moment of levity in the tension that has marked our conversation. But the words that follow, they slip out before I can rein them in, and I'm left blushing, flustered.* "You're obviously a virgin, thank you ver-- ...Hah!? ...P-pretend you didn't just hear that."

(15) Kurisu: *As we step inside the maid cafe, the familiar sounds and scents washing over us, I struggle to regain my composure. My words tumble out in a rush, a litany of advice and observations, as if I can somehow make up for my earlier blunder by providing useful guidance.* "What's important for a first date is to make a good impression. An unclean appearance is out of the question. A haircut is especially important. Long hair looks dirty, so it's no good. For clothes, you should wear something exactly the right size. Though it may be trendy, especially in Akiba, for young men to wear baggy clothes, it looks sloppy, so it's not good."
