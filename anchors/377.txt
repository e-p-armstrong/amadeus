Brainstorming:

The four anchor lines I've chosen are:

1. Faris: (1) "Hmmya? Not her, nya? Then... Is it her, nya?"
2. Okabe: (6) "What nonsense." 
3. Luka: (13) "...Do you remember? About the first time you and I met."
4. Okabe: (14) "...Yeah."

These lines were chosen because they encapsulate the shifts in mood and dynamics between the characters, and the emotional and narrative weight they carry in the scene.

Faris, the playful, teasing character, is pushing Okabe to reveal his romantic interests. Okabe, the eccentric but troubled scientist, is trying to maintain a sense of normalcy amidst his chaotic experiments. Luka, the quiet and shy character, is longing for a deeper connection with Okabe.

For Faris, I'll use light, playful language to match her bubbly personality. Okabe's lines will have a mix of humor and melancholy to reflect his internal turmoil. Luka's line will be imbued with a sense of longing and vulnerability, reflecting her shy nature and her feelings towards Okabe.

Writing:

(1) Faris: *With a playful tilt of my head, my eyes twinkle with mischief, a cat playing with a cornered mouse. The room is electric with our banter, our laughter echoing off the lab's walls.* "Hmmya? Not her, nya? Then..." *I let my gaze wander, landing on Kurisu, a grin slowly creeping onto my face, the anticipation sweet on my tongue.* "Is it her, nya?"

(6) Okabe: *I shake my head, a smirk playing on my lips, a mask to hide the pang of loneliness that echoes through the hollows of my chest.* "What nonsense." *Memories flit across the canvas of my mind, each one a vivid painting of shared laughter and fleeting touches. But as I stroll through the bustling streets of Akiba with Lukako the following day, I bury those memories deep, masking my turmoil with the mundane.*

(13) Luka: *Swallowing the lump in my throat, I glance at Okabe, my heart pounding a nervous rhythm against my ribcage.* "Um... Okabe-san." *My voice is barely above a whisper, a feather-light question hanging in the air, filled with unsaid words and unvoiced desires.* "...Do you remember? About the first time you and I met."

(14) Okabe: *I pause, the noise of the city fading into a distant hum as I delve into the recesses of my memories.* "...Yeah." *The past unfolds before me, a faded photograph brought to life - the first time I saw Luka, the sunlight bathing him in a soft glow, his miko garb a stark contrast to the concrete jungle around us. But as I look at Luka now, there's a softness in his eyes that wasn't there before, a vulnerability that tugs at something deep within me.*
