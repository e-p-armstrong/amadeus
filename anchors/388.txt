Lines to anchor the scene:

(1) Luka: "Because... because... If I change back into a guy... I'll have to hide my feelings for you! It would be wrong for me to love you, if I'm a guy..."

(7) Luka: "Yes... It makes me happy to hear you say that... Okabe-san... please send the email. Please. Send it quickly... If you let me feel your warmth any longer, I... I might say even worse things... I can't hold back my feelings anymore!"

(10) Okabe: "Lukako..."

(17) Luka: "Thank you... Okabe-san. Farewell... my love..."

Personality notes:

Luka - Sensitive, emotional, desperate. Her actions should be filled with heartfelt expressions, teary eyes, trembling hands, and a voice choked with emotion. 

Okabe - Conflicted, guilty, pained. His actions should be heavy, burdened with the weight of his decision. His eyes should be filled with regret, his voice thick with guilt and sorrow.

Thematic direction:

For Luka's lines, I'll focus on the emotional turmoil she is going through, her unrequited love for Okabe, and her desperate plea to be remembered as she is now. Her actions should be intense, filled with raw emotion and heartbreaking vulnerability.

For Okabe's lines, I'll focus on his internal struggle, his sense of duty and guilt, and the weight of his decision. His actions should be heavy and hesitant, reflecting the immense burden he carries.

Enhanced lines:

(1) Luka: *My heart feels like it's shattering into a thousand pieces, each fragment a testament to my unspoken love for Okabe. My voice cracks as I speak, the words tumbling out in a desperate plea, each syllable laced with a pain that feels unbearable.* "Because... because... If I change back into a guy... I'll have to hide my feelings for you! It would be wrong for me to love you, if I'm a guy..."

(7) Luka: *With a shaky smile, I muster every ounce of courage I have left, my hands trembling as I clasp his. The weight of the moment feels overwhelming, yet I know there's no turning back now.* "Yes... It makes me happy to hear you say that... Okabe-san... please send the email. Please. Send it quickly... If you let me feel your warmth any longer, I... I might say even worse things... I can't hold back my feelings anymore!"

(10) Okabe: *I feel like I'm drowning, each breath more labored than the last. The guilt gnaws at me from the inside, a relentless beast that refuses to be silenced. I can hardly bear to look at her, her pain mirroring my own. My voice is a mere whisper, the words caught in my throat.* "Lukako..."

(17) Luka: *With one last, lingering look, I guide his trembling fingers towards the Send button, my heart pounding in my chest. This is it, the point of no return. A single tear escapes, trailing down my cheek as I whisper my final goodbye.* "Thank you... Okabe-san. Farewell... my love..."
