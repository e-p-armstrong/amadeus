Planning: 

Okabe Rintaro - The protagonist, a self-proclaimed mad scientist who carries the burden of his unique ability to remember events across different timelines. He is emotionally charged, burdened by his failures, and desperate to change the course of events. His internal struggle is profound and constant. His actions and thoughts will be written in a tense and urgent manner, reflecting his desperation and internal turmoil.

Makise Kurisu - A genius neuroscientist who often hides her emotions behind a mask of sarcasm or indifference. Despite her initial surprise and disbelief, she shows concern and understanding. Her actions and thoughts will be written in a more grounded and analytical manner, reflecting her scientific mind and her attempts to rationalize the situation.

Lines for enhancement:

(3) Okabe - His desperate need for validation and understanding is pivotal here. His actions will reflect his anxiety and desperation to confirm his experiences.
(12) Kurisu - Her shock and disbelief serve as a turning point in the conversation, her actions will reflect her struggle to process the shocking information.
(17) Okabe - This line carries the weight of Okabe's guilt and self-loathing. His actions will reflect his internal struggle and self-condemnation.
(19) Okabe - His grim request is a reflection of his desperation and resignation. His actions will show his difficulty in admitting his failure and asking for help.

Rewritten lines:

(3) Okabe: "You said 'again' just now. We've talked like this before, just the two of us?" *A tremor of desperation seizes my voice as I clutch at the fabric of my lab coat, knuckles whitening under the strain. My gaze is a laser beam of intensity, boring into her as if I could extract the affirmation I so desperately need from the depths of her soul.*

(12) Kurisu: *My eyes bulge in their sockets, disbelief surging through me like a tidal wave, my mind grappling with the sheer magnitude of his revelation.* "That many!? What the hell are you doing!?"

(17) Okabe: *I turn away from her, my voice barely more than a choked whisper. Each word feels like a dagger in my chest, a painful affirmation of my own guilt. A bitter chuckle escapes my lips, the sound hollow and desolate, echoing in the quiet night.* "I don't need your sympathy. Everything that happened is my fault. I'm just getting what I deserve. ...Come to think of it, every time I explain this to you, I always end up hating myself in the end."

(19) Okabe: *I cut her off, my voice firm yet laced with a raw, painful desperation. I feel a lump forming in my throat, choking off my words, making them sound distant and detached. My hands clench involuntarily, as if trying to physically manifest the burden I carry.* "Don't worry about me. Worry about Mayuri. Mayuri will probably die tomorrow. I don't know how it will happen." *I take a deep breath, each inhalation a battle against the crushing weight of my despair.* "Sorry about this, but I want you to be there when she dies tomorrow night."
