Character Archetypes/Personalities:

1. Kurisu: A brilliant scientist who is often sarcastic and hides her concern behind a veneer of calm and rationality. She's also a bit awkward in expressing her feelings, which is why her actions often carry more weight than her words.

2. Okabe: A passionate and stubborn scientist who, despite his eccentricity and dramatic flair, deeply cares for his friends. His determination to save Mayuri manifests in his actions and thoughts, making him seem more serious and focused than usual.

3. Male Staff-Member: An office worker who is just delivering the news, unaware of the emotional impact his words might have.

Lines to enhance and thematic direction:

(3) Kurisu: Her concern for Okabe is evident in this line. I'll enhance it by focusing on her struggle to convey her worry and the emotional weight she feels, watching Okabe shoulder this burden.

(4) Okabe: This line captures Okabe's determination to protect Mayuri and the emotional toll it's taking on him. I'll enhance it by delving into his thoughts, the plans he's formulating, and his resolve to take on this heavy responsibility.

(9) Kurisu: Her sarcasm and attempt to lighten the mood despite the gravity of the situation is a testament to her personality. I'll enhance this line by focusing on her struggle to maintain a semblance of normalcy amidst the tension.

(14) Okabe: This line is a turning point in the scene where Okabe's hope is crushed. I'll enhance it by focusing on his shock and despair at the news, and how it shatters his plan.

Enhanced lines:

(3) Kurisu: *I swallow hard, the words tumbling out before I can stop them. My gaze is locked onto Okabe, studying his face for signs of the strain I know he must be feeling.* "You're carrying an awful burden." *My voice is softer than I intend, a whisper lost in the static hum of our lab, the sentiment heavier than the silence it breaks.*

(4) Okabe: *I raise my eyebrows, a faint smile playing on my lips as I try to brush off her concern.* "I told you not to worry about me." *I say, my voice steady even as my mind races, darting through scenarios and contingencies, a maze of 'what ifs' and 'maybes'. My gaze drifts to the lab's wall clock, its ticking a cruel reminder of the ticking time bomb I am racing against.* "It's Mayuri you need to worry about. Tomorrow, I'm going to look for Moeka." *My fingers tighten around the edge of the table as I force myself to stay grounded, to stay focused.*

(9) Kurisu: *I cock an eyebrow, the corner of my mouth quirking up in a half-hearted attempt to inject some levity into the thick tension that hangs in the air.* "Where did all this trust come from?" *I ask, my tone lighter than the heaviness in my chest, my heart pounding a staccato rhythm against my ribs. I can't afford to let the fear seep into my voice, not when Okabe needs me to be strong.*

(14) Okabe: *My heart plummets, dropping like a stone in the pit of my stomach as his words echo in my ears.* "You... don't?" *I ask, my voice barely more than a breath, the question hanging in the air between us like a specter. The world tilts beneath me, the reality of the situation crashing down, shattering my plans like fragile glass.*
