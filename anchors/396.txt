Planning:

The characters involved in this scene are Okabe, Kurisu, and Moeka.

Okabe: He is driven by his desperation to save his friend Mayuri. He is struggling with his own morality as he physically restrains Moeka. He is typically eccentric and dramatic, often taking on the persona of a mad scientist. He is a man of action, not afraid to take risks if it means achieving his goals.

Kurisu: She is intelligent and serious, often acting as the voice of reason within the group. She is concerned for Okabe's wellbeing but also understands the importance of their mission. She is not physically present in this scene, but her presence is felt through her dialogue.

Moeka: She is quiet and introverted, often preferring to communicate through text messages. She is fiercely loyal to FB, her mysterious superior. Despite her timid personality, she is willing to fight to protect her secrets.

I will choose to enhance lines (1), (5), (10), and (17) to serve as the anchors of the scene. 

(1) will set the scene's tone, showing Okabe's desperation and the conflict he feels as he takes drastic measures to achieve his goals. 

(5) will illustrate Okabe's determination and tenacity, even in the face of danger. It will show his resolve to save Mayuri at any cost.

(10) will provide a glimpse into Kurisu's character. Her relief at hearing Moeka is alive will show her empathy and her belief in Okabe, despite the chaos.

(17) will conclude the scene, showing Okabe's determination to carry on, and his reliance on Kurisu, despite the dangers they face.

Now, I will rewrite the selected lines:

(1) Okabe: *I can feel my fingers digging into the soft flesh of Moeka's throat. The cold, metallic taste of fear is strong in the air, overpowering the musty smell of the confined space. The tightness in my chest is a constant reminder of the high stakes. The phone, slick with her sweat, slips into my grasp. A wave of guilt washes over me, but I push it aside. There's too much at stake to give in to such emotions.*

(5) Okabe: *The door slams shut behind me with a resounding thud, echoing my pounding heart. The cold metal of the doorknob presses against my back, a stark contrast to the heat of the battle I've just left behind. I can hear her, her feeble attempts to reclaim what I've taken, but I ignore it. My fingers dance over the phone's screen, a ballet of desperation and determination. The message is ready. Mayuri's fate hangs in the balance, a delicate thread I'm holding onto with all my might.*

(10) Kurisu: *The relief that washes over me is almost palpable. I had been holding my breath, the fear of the unknown clawing at my insides. The thought of Okabe taking a life was too much to bear. My fingers relax their death grip on the phone, and I allow myself a small smile. Amidst the chaos, there's a glimmer of hope, a testament to Okabe's humanity.*

(17) Okabe: *My fingers tighten around the phone, the cold plastic serving as a stark reminder of the reality I'm in. My heart hammers against my ribcage, a rhythm of desperation and determination. The warmth of Kurisu's voice on the other end is my lifeline, a beacon in the storm. I take a deep breath, steeling myself for what's to come. This isn't over. I won't let it be. Not yet.*
