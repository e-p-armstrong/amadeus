Character Personalities and Archetypes:

Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, who is eccentric, excitable, and often acts impulsively. His actions and thoughts should reflect this. He is also deeply concerned and protective of his friends, particularly in this high-stakes situation. His thoughts should be frantic and scattered, his actions erratic and full of energy.

Kurisu is a brilliant scientist who is often the voice of reason in Okabe's chaotic world. She is calm, methodical, and analytical. Her actions should be understated, her thoughts logical and precise. However, she also cares deeply about Okabe and their friends, and this should be subtly reflected in her dialogue and actions.

(17) Okabe: *I slide my phone into my pocket, the dull thud echoing in the lonely corridor. My fingers fly over the keyboard, crafting another message, another desperate plea to the past. But still, nothing changes. The world remains stubbornly still, indifferent to my efforts. I rub my eyes, the world spinning as I grapple with the crushing weight of our failure. My heart pounds in my chest, a frantic rhythm that fuels my determination. I pull out my phone again, hoping against hope that this time, it will be different.* "Are you there?"

(21) Okabe: *Reality crashes down on me, a merciless wave that steals the breath from my lungs.* "Nothing... changed?" *My voice is barely a whisper, a feeble protest against the relentless march of time. I close my eyes, the darkness a stark reminder of our failure. The silence is oppressive, suffocating, a physical manifestation of my despair.*
