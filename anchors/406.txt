Enhanced Lines:

(3) Okabe: *A fleeting moment of relief blossoms in my chest, confirmation of FB's existence acting as a temporary balm. But it's swiftly overtaken by a chilling wave of fear, the grim truth of his enmity resurfacing like a specter. My thoughts whirl, spinning around the cryptic words Moeka had uttered. 'Did FB abandon her mission for the IBN 5100?' Tennouji's last words echo in the hollow chambers of my mind, their insidious undertones freezing my blood.* "Doing your duty sets you up for disposal. So we're more like cattle than dogs." *A shiver of dread snakes down my spine, the implications of his words a dark cloud on my horizon. Could it be possible that the mission was abandoned to avoid their inevitable destruction? Yet, even that wouldn't be enough to cheat the cruel hand of fate, would it? We're all just pawns in the grand scheme of things. Suddenly, Nae's words pierce through my muddled thoughts, a sharp blade of reality.* "I won't forgive you, until I kill you with my own hands." *I flinch, instinctively covering my ears as if to shield myself from the harsh truth. The innocent voice filled with venomous hatred haunts me, a reminder of the monster I had unwittingly created. A metallic taste spreads across my tongue as I bite down on my lip, hard. But... that worldline has been undone, hasn't it? I forcefully shake my head, attempting to clear the fog of confusion. I need to focus, prioritize the present. If everything went as planned, the IBN 5100 should be back in my possession. And if that's the case... I don't need to stay on this doomed worldline.*

(10) Kurisu: *She reaches out, her hand coming to rest on my shoulder in a comforting gesture. The warmth of her touch seeps through my lab coat, a gentle reminder of our shared burdens.* "Don't worry about it, Okabe. Send the D-Mail right now. That'll solve everything." *Her voice is soft, laced with concern that she tries to mask with practicality. I can see the faith in her eyes, a steadfast belief in our scientific endeavor. She believes that we can fix this, mend the timeline that we've fractured with our reckless curiosity.*

(11) Okabe: *I close my hand around FB's phone, the cold plastic a stark contrast to the heat of my resolve.* "I can't pretend I didn't see that." *The words spill out, firm and resolute. A grim acceptance of my responsibility for Nae's actions. I am a mad scientist, but I am also a human, capable of guilt and compassion.* "I'm time leaping. Back to the lab." *My voice rings out in the room, determination etched into every syllable.*

(13) Okabe: *She glances at Moeka, her eyebrows knitting together in a silent question. I can see the gears turning in her mind, trying to decipher the enigma that is Moeka. I lean in, my voice barely above a whisper as I try to divert her attention.* "Isn't she our enemy?" "...It's about 7 AM, right?" *My words hang in the air, a pitiful attempt to change the subject. I can't bear to see the confusion in her eyes, the dawning realization of our predicament. I want to shield her from the harsh reality, maintain some semblance of control in this chaotic mess.*
