(4) Nae: *My eyes, cold as the steel blade I had held moments ago, bore into Okabe's pained expression. I shrugged dismissively, the words falling from my lips with a chilling indifference.* "Hmph. What do I care about those fifteen years? There's nothing for me there..." *With a final glance that was more ice than emotion, I released my grip on Okabe's arm, leaving my hands painted with the crimson evidence of his suffering. Turning away, the hollow echo of my victory resonating within me, I left him with my parting words.* "I don't need anything from you now. Just wait in fear and regret, Okabe Rintaro. Until I come for you in fifteen years."

(5) Okabe: *I watched her silhouette fade into the encroaching darkness, the sense of powerlessness gnawing at my insides. I felt a hollow laugh clawing its way up my throat, a bitter tribute to the cruel farce my life had become.* "Hahaha..." *The laugh echoed into the night, a haunting reminder of my failures and the absurdity of my predicament.*

(6) Kurisu: *My heart pounded a frantic rhythm as I rushed to Okabe's side, the grim tableau of him, wounded and alone, etched into my mind.* "Okabe!" *His bloodied arm sent a shudder of fear coursing through me, and I dropped to my knees beside him, my hands trembling as they reached out.* "What happened!? Are you okay!?"

(9) Okabe: *With a grim determination, I reached for the phone Kurisu offered, the device's familiar weight a cold comfort in my hand. My fingers danced over the keys, typing out a message that was both our last hope and my greatest fear.* "Calm down... I'm gonna send the D-Mail now."
