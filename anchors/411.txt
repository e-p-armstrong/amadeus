Lines to Enhance:
1. (1) Kurisu: "Besides, we were already planning to crack SERN's database, weren't we? Fine. Let's see what's in there. If the mail data exists, then it's proof that what you said is true."
2. (5) Itaru: "Done bridging them. I need to tinker with the settings a little, but we should be up and running in about ten minutes."
