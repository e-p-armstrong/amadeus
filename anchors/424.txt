Enhanced lines:

(1) Okabe: *My fists clench tighter, the knuckles whitening under the strain. My heart pounds against my ribcage, each beat echoing the silent proclamation of my resolve. I can feel the weight of the world pressing down on me, but I refuse to bow, refuse to shatter.* "This time..." *I murmur, the words a whispered oath to the silent room, a promise to the ghosts of choices yet unmade.*

(2) Kurisu: *She scoffs, her arms crossing defensively across her chest as she turns away. Her foot taps an agitated tattoo against the worn floorboards, a silent testament to the tempest of frustration brewing within her.* "Hmph!" *She spins back to face me, her eyes a stormy mix of anger and disbelief. Her hands, curled into tight fists at her sides, tremble subtly with the force of her unspoken emotions as she steps closer, her words slicing through the tension-filled air like a sharpened blade.* "There's nothing you can do. It's the choice of Steins Gate. Isn't that what you always say? The equation is proven, Okabe. There's no escape. You're just one man. No matter how hard you try, you can't overcome the will of the universe."

(3) Okabe: *Her words strike me like a physical blow, their cold logic a stark contrast to the fire of my determination. But I refuse to let them shatter me, refuse to let them extinguish the spark of hope within me. I meet her gaze, my own eyes unwavering, filled with a conviction that surprises even me.* "I know... but I'm still going to try!" *I assert, the words ringing out in the silent room, a bold declaration of my unwavering resolve.*

(4) Kurisu: *She grinds her teeth together, the sound a harsh counterpoint to the silence of the room. Her expression hardens, the softness that once resided there replaced by a cold, impenetrable shield of resignation. She turns her back to me, her shoulders rigid with tension.* "Kuh..." *Her voice is a frigid gust of wind, the words falling like shards of ice.* "Have it your way! But I'm not helping. I'm going back to America, and that's that. Goodbye. I don't expect we'll meet again, Hououin Kyouma."
