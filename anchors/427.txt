## Writing:

(7) Okabe: *I nod, a strained smile pulling at the corners of my mouth, the fragile facade of casual indifference teetering precariously.* "Right. So it only left a weak impression. Probably not enough to become a long-term memory." *I inhale deeply, the taste of our shared kiss still lingering on my lips, a stark contrast to the bitter pill of deception I'm forcing down my throat.* I'm lying, of course. *My heart pounds against my ribcage, each beat a thunderous echo of the truth I can't voice.* I've never felt such an intense kiss as that. The shock was like a lightning bolt to the brain. But still, I'm lying. Because if I miss this opportunity, I'll never be able to touch Kurisu again. This is my last chance. *My fingers twitch, itching to reach out, to bridge the gap between us once more.* "So, once more."

(9) Okabe: *I watch her closely, my gaze tracing the contours of her face, lingering on the soft blush that paints her cheeks.* Kurisu fidgets. She usually glares at me harshly, but now she's avoiding my eyes. *A knot of anticipation forms in my stomach, the air between us charged with the weight of unspoken words and lingering glances.* "I don't ever want to forget... so let's make doubly sure." *My hand reaches out, the tremble in my fingers betraying the calm facade I'm desperately clinging to. As I draw her closer, the familiar scent of her hair filling my senses, I make a silent vow—to remember, to never forget.*

(12) Kurisu: *Her eyes, a mirror to the turmoil within, meet mine, her voice barely a whisper against the silence that surrounds us.* "Just a kiss... okay?" *Her lips part, the unspoken plea hanging heavy in the air between us.* "Be gentle... okay?" *Her words are a lifeline, a beacon in the tumultuous sea of emotions that threatens to consume us. And in that moment, I see her—not as the confident scientist, but as Kurisu, vulnerable and afraid, yet willing to take the leap of faith with me.*

(17) Okabe: *My heart hammers against my chest, a deafening symphony of longing and fear. As I pull her closer, the warmth of her body seeping into mine, I drown in the reality of our shared intimacy.* We press our lips together again. Stronger than the first time. Longer than the first time. *Each passing second is a stolen treasure, a fleeting moment of borrowed time. Her taste, her scent, her warmth—they're a balm to the gnawing dread within me.* I never want to let go. We embrace each other tightly, our feelings too powerful to contain.
