Enhanced Lines:

(4) Okabe: *My heart throbs in my chest, the constant drumming echoing the turmoil within me. Unbidden, my feet carry me towards the Time Leap Machine, the harbinger of our joy and sorrow, an innocent tool tainted by our ambition. I squat down, my fingers tracing the icy metallic contours of the microwave, a shiver of regret snaking its way up my spine. The reality of our folly seeps into me, a cold realization. I rise, a newfound determination steeling my resolve. The machine will have to pay for our sins. Once this is over, I'll lay it to rest, bury our mistakes with it.*

(6) Okabe: *My heart pounds a frenzied rhythm against my rib cage, each beat echoing my escalating anxiety. The world around me blurs as I rush towards Itaru, the roar of blood in my ears drowning out all other sounds. My voice comes out as a strangled whisper, the weight of our actions hanging heavily in the air.* "The D-Mail I sent? It's there!?"

(9) Itaru: *With a flourish, I rise from the seat, my heart pounding with a mix of fear and exhilaration. The moment of truth is upon us. I extend my hand towards the open seat, offering it to Okabe like a throne. The room falls silent, the only sound the humming of the IBN 5100, waiting obediently for its master's command.* "Everything's set. One press of the enter key, and that data's gone. I leave that honor to you, Okarin."

(10) Okabe: *The chair beneath me feels cold, a stark contrast to the heat coursing through my veins. My fingers hover over the keyboard, the gravity of the moment pressing down on me. A fleeting image of Kurisu flits across my closed eyelids, a silent goodbye. With a deep breath, I raise my hand, my finger poised like a sword over the enter key, ready to slay the past.* "Victory is at hand!" *My voice rings out, a triumphant war cry, bouncing off the lab walls, filling the room with a sense of closure. I throw my head back, a laugh bubbling up from within me, a testament to our victory.* "With unimaginable brilliance and unwavering conviction, I have defeated our vast and powerful enemy and now stand triumphant on the field of Ragnarok! I give thanks to the comrades... whose sacrifice made this victory possible!"
