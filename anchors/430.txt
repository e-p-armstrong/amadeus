Planning:

The lines I choose to enhance are:

(1) Okabe: "The coming world... is the world I wished for! This is the choice of Steins Gate! Let the world be reborn!"
(3) Okabe: "--"
(5) Okabe: "..."
(8) Okabe: "...No."

Okabe is a dramatic, passionate individual with a flair for theatrics. He's highly intelligent and deeply cares for his friends. In this scene, he's wrestling with the heartbreaking choice he's made. His lines will reflect his struggle with the heavy burden of his decision and the tragic loss he's about to endure.

(1) Okabe: *My heart pounds, its thunderous beats echoing the gravity of the moment. I stare at the contraption before me, the machine we made together, its cold, metallic surface a stark contrast to the warm memories it holds.* "The coming world... is the world I wished for!" *I say, the words tasting like ash on my tongue, a bitter testament to the choice I've made.* "This is the choice of Steins Gate!" *I proclaim, my voice wavering under the weight of the truth.* "Let the world be reborn!" *I command, a desperate plea to the universe, my hand hovering over the key that will set everything in motion.*

(3) Okabe: *My heart skips a beat as the door creaks open. There she is, Kurisu, her fiery hair a beacon in the sterile lab. The sight of her is like a punch to the gut, her presence a painful reminder of the choice I've made. I want to reach out to her, to pull her into my arms and shield her from the inevitable. But all I can do is watch, my hand frozen above the key, as she smiles at me, her eyes filled with a tenderness that threatens to shatter my resolve.*

(5) Okabe: *The world comes back into focus, the swirling vortex of time dissipating to reveal the lab, untouched and unchanged. I look towards the door, half-expecting to see her there. But the room is empty, her absence a deafening silence. I run a hand over the smooth surface of the PhoneWave, its cold metal a stark reminder of the reality I've chosen. A lump forms in my throat as I turn to my friends, their faces filled with confusion and concern. I force a smile, my voice barely a whisper.* "...Hey, who was Lab Mem 004 again?"

(8) Okabe: *Their confusion is palpable, their eyes wide with concern. I shake my head, a bitter smile tugging at my lips. I want to laugh, to shrug it off as a joke, a momentary lapse in memory. But the truth is heavy on my tongue, a crushing weight that threatens to suffocate me. I look at them, my friends, my family, and I swallow hard, my voice barely above a whisper.* "...No."
