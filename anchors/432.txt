Planning and Brainstorming:

The four lines I have chosen to enhance are: (1) Itaru, (3) Okabe, (4) Kurisu, and (7) Okabe. These lines were chosen due to their narrative weight and the emotional depth they offer. 

Itaru (1) is often portrayed as the relaxed, comedic relief character, but he is also a deep thinker, able to grasp the gravity of situations. His statement about the PhoneWave's value will be enhanced to emphasize his mixed feelings about the destruction of their creation and the lost potential it represents. 

Okabe (3) is the protagonist, and his line carries the weight of the trio's decision to dismantle the PhoneWave. This line will be enriched with Okabe's internal struggle, his longing for the ordinary, and his acceptance of the end of an era. 

Kurisu (4) is a central character who is intellectual, rational, but also deeply emotional. Her line will be expanded to showcase her acceptance of her past mistakes and the growth she has experienced. 

Okabe (7) offers a surprising turn of events that rekindles the trio's connection with their past. His reaction to the sight of the satellite will be enriched with his shock, confusion, and the resurgence of unresolved feelings.

Now, to add the anchors to the lines:

(1) Itaru: *I heave a sigh, my eyes tracing the scattered pieces of our once glorious creation. My heart twinges, a pang of regret undercut by a sense of relief. My fingers twitch, yearning for the familiar hum of the machine, the pulsating rhythm of possibilities it once held.* "Man, what a waste. That thing was worth a fortune."

(3) Okabe: *I draw in a sharp breath, the metallic taste of finality heavy on my tongue. I reach out, my fingers ghosting over the skeletal remains of the PhoneWave, the echoes of our past reverberating through my touch. I force a smile for Mayuri, but my heart pulses with a mournful rhythm, a dirge for the dreams we once held.* "Come on. I'll get you a new microwave." *My gaze lingers on the PhoneWave, a monument to our ambition, our folly, our triumphs. Its end marks the death of Hououin Kyouma, the mad scientist. Kurisu's words, like a balm, soothe the raw edges of my regret.*

(4) Kurisu: *I exist now only as a specter in his memories, a lingering echo of our shared past. My voice, a mere whisper against the tide of his thoughts, carries the weight of my acceptance, my growth, my resilience. I am the sum of my past, a mosaic crafted from shards of mistakes and victories.* "I don't want to deny who I've been. Because even my failures are a part of who I am today."

(7) Okabe: *My breath catches, my heart stutters, a primal reaction to the sight of the satellite. It's a ghost from our past, a stark reminder of our dalliances with time. Its presence stirs a whirlwind of emotions, a tumultuous mix of shock, confusion, and an inexplicable sense of longing. The world tilts, reality blurring at the edges, as I grapple with the implications.* "No way..."
