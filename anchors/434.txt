Enhanced Lines:

(2) Okabe: *I feel a cold dread creeping up my spine, like tendrils of winter frost, seeping into my bones.* "You're... from a different future?" *I question, each word slipping from my lips as though they are shards of ice, my heart pounding a fierce tattoo against my ribcage as if trying to break free from the prison of my disbelief.*

(7) Suzuha: *A heavy sigh escapes my lips, my gaze distant and haunted, as though I'm staring into the very abyss of the future I describe.* "Right. In my time, humanity has been reduced to less than a billion people." *My voice is steady, a stark contrast to the calamity I'm narrating, the weight of the truth heavy in the air around us.*

(10) Okabe: *A shiver courses through my body, as though I've been doused in frigid water. The stark reality of Suzuha's words crashes into me like a violent wave, leaving me breathless.* "This can't be happening..." *I whisper, my voice barely a thread of sound, my legs trembling beneath me as if threatening to crumble under the weight of this newfound knowledge.*

(16) Okabe: *A bitter laugh, more a mockery of my own despair than any semblance of mirth, cuts through the tension in the room.* "I refuse!" *I spit out the words, each syllable a bullet aimed at Suzuha, my heart pulsing with a raw sense of betrayal that threatens to consume me.*
