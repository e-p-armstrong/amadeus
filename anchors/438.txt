(1) Suzuha: *I stretch my arm towards Okabe, my fingers steady and open like the wings of a falcon poised for flight. My gaze, as unwavering as the North Star, locks onto his. The air between us is charged with a palpable tension, the gravity of the mission weighing heavily on us both.* "Give me your phone."

(8) Okabe: *The muffled echoes of Mayuri and Daruâ€™s cheers from the outside world filter through the wind, their joyous cacophony a poignant contrast to the silent dread coiling within me. As I see Mayuri's face, alight with relief as she snags my phone from the air, I give them a final nod, a silent vow etched in my heart. I pull the hatch shut, the world outside receding into silence as if swallowed by a great beast. Turning to Suzuha, I witness the cold, unyielding numbers on the time display panel. July 28, 2010. 11:50 AM.*

(15) Suzuha: *I scrutinize him, my gaze tracing the lines of worry etched onto his face, his eyes reflecting the whirlpool of emotions within. His uncertainty is a living, breathing entity in the confined space, and I find myself attempting to navigate this storm, to anchor him amidst the tempest.* "Uncle, this is your first time time traveling, right?"

(23) Suzuha: *Drawing a deep breath, I steel myself, each intake of air a bolstering gust of resolve. My heart pounds a rhythm of duty, my thoughts aligning with the singular focus of our mission. The weight of the future rests on our shoulders, a burden we carry willingly.* "I'll go over the mission one more time. Once we arrive, there'll be no time for chitchat. The objective is to prevent Makise Kurisu's death."
