## Brainstorming and Planning:

The Characters:

1. Kurisu: A brilliant young scientist, Kurisu is often reserved and calm, but in this scene, she displays a rare show of emotion and vulnerability. Her words should be laced with disbelief, hurt, and a desperate need for validation from the man who should have been her most steadfast supporter.

2. Nakabachi: He is a bitter and resentful man, driven by jealousy and a deep-seated inferiority complex. His actions and thoughts should be full of rage and regret. Despite his brutal actions, there is a pitiful desperation to him, a man who has been outshone by his own child.

3. Okabe: He is a protective and caring friend to Kurisu. His actions should be filled with determination, concern, and an overwhelming need to protect Kurisu from her father's violent rage.

Lines to be enhanced:

1. (3) Kurisu: *I gather my courage, taking a step forward and locking eyes with him.* "You're stealing my work? I didn't think even you would do something like-- Ah!"

2. (4) Nakabachi: *I spin around, my palm connecting with her cheek with a loud smack.* "Who do you think you're talking to!?" *With a flick of my wrist, I discard the paper, its contents meaningless to me. My hand closes around Kurisu's throat, squeezing until her gasps fill the room.*

3. (7) Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest as I watch the scene unfold, every fibre of my being screaming at me to intervene. I push off from my hiding spot, charging towards the man with a roar.* "Stop!"

4. (11) Okabe: *I stand tall, my eyes blazing with determination.* "I won't let you kill Kurisu!"

Thematic Direction:

For Kurisu, I want to enhance the feeling of betrayal and shock. Her actions should reflect her disbelief and hurt, while also showing her courage to confront her father. For Nakabachi, I want to emphasize his rage and resentment, but also highlight his pathetic desperation and regret. For Okabe, I will focus on his determination and protectiveness, his actions driven by a fierce need to safeguard Kurisu from harm.

## Writing:

(3) Kurisu: *There's a tremor in my heart as I draw myself up, my gaze piercing into the man who has betrayed me. The taste of bitter disbelief lingers on my tongue, mingling with the cold sting of betrayal.* "You're stealing my work?" *My voice is small, but it carries the weight of a thousand unsaid words, echoing in the stark silence that hangs between us.* "I didn't think even you would do something like-- Ah!"

(4) Nakabachi: *In the throes of my rage, I whirl around, my hand lashing out in a cruel arc. It collides with her cheek, a harsh reminder of the power I still hold.* "Who do you think you're talking to!?" *With a sneer, I discard the paper, the embodiment of my failures and inadequacies. My hand snakes around Kurisu's throat, squeezing, my resentment manifesting in the tightening grip that stifles her breaths.*

(7) Okabe: *There's a beast in my chest, its roar echoing in my veins as I watch the horrifying scene unfold before me. My heart is a war drum, its rhythm urging me to action. With a surge of adrenaline, I propel myself from my hiding spot, a primal instinct overriding any semblance of fear.* "Stop!"

(11) Okabe: *I rise, my spine straight, my resolve unyielding. The world seems to hold its breath as I face the monster before me, my eyes aflame with a fierce determination that would make the gods themselves tremble.* "I won't let you kill Kurisu!"
