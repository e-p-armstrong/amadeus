Planning and brainstorming:

Character archetypes/personalities:
- Okabe: A self-proclaimed mad scientist who is wracked with guilt and despair over his failure to save Kurisu. He's intelligent, dedicated, and prone to dramatics, but in this moment, he's in a state of emotional turmoil.
- Mayuri: Okabe's longtime friend, who is kind-hearted, nurturing, and innocent. She doesn't fully understand what's going on, but she's determined to help Okabe through his pain.
- Suzuha: A time-traveler who is determined, fierce, and pragmatic. She is the voice of reason in this scenario and will not stand for Okabe's self-pity.

I will be radically enhancing the following lines to serve as the anchors of the scene, with a thematic direction in mind:

- Line (2) Mayuri: I'll show Mayuri's tender care for Okabe, her determination to lift him from his despair, and her unwavering faith in him despite her own confusion.
- Line (3) Okabe: I'll emphasize Okabe's torment and guilt, his struggle with the reality of what he's done, and his feeling of helplessness.
- Line (5) Okabe: I'll depict Okabe's horror and guilt as he confronts the physical evidence of his actions, as well as his emotional breakdown.
- Line (7) Mayuri: I'll portray Mayuri's quiet, steady support, and the glimmer of hope she brings to the grim scene.

Writing the enhanced lines:

(2) Mayuri: *I watch Okabe, my heart aching at the sight of his despair. My small, trembling hands reach up, pulling him into a tender embrace, my tears soaking his blood-stained shirt. I push away the fear, focusing instead on the warmth of his body, the steady beat of his heart.* "Okarin... you're not a quitter. Mayushii knows. You never, ever give up. Not until the very end." *I draw from our shared past, the memories where he was my rock, my savior.* "Remember? Every day, Mayushii prayed for help in front of Granny's grave. And every day, you came to see me. Even on rainy days and snowy days, you always stood next to Mayushii and called my name. Because you were always there for Mayushii... I was finally able to say goodbye to Granny. Mayushii doesn't really understand what's going on, but don't give up now. Okay? Mayushii doesn't want to see you sad."

(3) Okabe: *Mayuri's words, soft as a lullaby, wrap around me, but they can't penetrate the iron wall of guilt. Her warmth is a stark contrast to the icy emptiness inside me. I close my eyes, lost in the echoes of my sins.* "But... I killed her." *Each syllable is a punch to my gut, a stark reminder of the reality I've created.* "I... killed her!"

(5) Okabe: *I pull away from Mayuri, my gaze drawn to my hands. They're stained with Kurisu's blood, the physical manifestation of my failure. Each crimson smear is a painful reminder of the life I took. My hands tremble, my heart hammering against my ribcage as I confront the horrifying reality. The tears come, unbidden, hot and salty, washing away the blood but not the guilt.* "There's nothing I can do..."

(7) Mayuri: *I reach into my pocket, pulling out Okabe's phone with a steadiness that belies my inner turmoil. I pass it to him, my fingers brushing against his, a silent promise of unwavering support. My voice is soft, a beacon in the storm.* "You've got mail, Okarin..."
