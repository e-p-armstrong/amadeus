Enhanced Lines:

(1) Suzuha: *My eyes, wide and alert, latch onto Okabe's in a silent exchange of confusion and disbelief. The glow from his phone screen casts an eerie light on his face, highlighting the furrowed brow and parted lips. A chill of surprise courses through me, pricking my skin with goosebumps.* "It actually came through! Just like he said it would!" *The words tumble out, echoing in the lab's stillness, as the weight of the D-Mail's arrival anchors itself in reality.*

(4) Suzuha: *I rise from my hunched position, every muscle in my body taut with tension. My gaze, steady and unwavering, locks onto Okabe. The silence in the room is palpable, a deafening quietude that amplifies the urgency of my words.* "There must be something on. Something you need to see!" *My voice, a raw whisper of urgency, slices through the air, leaving a trail of intensity in its wake.*

(6) Okabe: *With a sidelong glance at Daru, relief washes over me in a cool wave. His impeccable timing, a beacon of normalcy amidst the chaos. My grip tightens around my phone, the plastic cool and reassuring against my palm, as I switch to the TV reception. A news reporter materializes on the small screen, flanked by the monstrous silhouette of a jumbo jet. The sight of the charred plane tail sends a jolt of ice down my spine, crystallizing the dread lurking in my heart.* "Fire on Russian Airlines."

A ghost from my past, a specter that triggers a whirlwind of memories. His face, a haunting reminder of a name, a title. The realization slams into me, a gut-wrenching punch that leaves my heart pounding a frantic tattoo against my ribs.* "Doctor Nakabachi!"
