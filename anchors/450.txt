Anchored lines:

(7) Okabe: *A tremor of understanding ripples through me, a seismic shift in the landscape of my comprehension. My fingers clench tightly around the edge of the table, knuckles blanching to match the sudden pallor of my face. I swallow hard, the words lodged in my throat like shards of glass.* "The Butterfly Effect!" *The realization hits me with the force of a freight train, the implications of our actions spreading out before me in a horrifying tableau. I can almost see the fragile wings of the butterfly, their delicate fluttering setting off a storm of consequences we never could have imagined.*

(12) Suzuha: *The words hang heavy in the air, a confession wrapped in regret and resignation. I can feel the weight of their gazes on me, a tangible manifestation of their shock and betrayal. My heart aches with the pain of what I've done, but the certainty of necessity hardens my resolve.* "Sorry for not telling you everything. But we needed you to fail once. You had to experience Makise Kurisu's death firsthand."

(17) Okabe: *My voice comes out as a low growl, the words ripped from me in a raw demand for answers. My gaze pierces Suzuha, a challenge and a plea wrapped in a single look. I can feel the anger simmering beneath my skin, the confusion gnawing at the edges of my mind.* "Tell me what's going on."

(24) Suzuha: *I meet his gaze squarely, my voice steady despite the storm of emotions raging within me. There's a glimmer of hope amidst the confusion, a beacon in the darkness that I pray he'll be able to see.* "Try again."
