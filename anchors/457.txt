Planning:
For the anchor lines, I will choose lines (3), (7), (14), and (20) because these lines are significant to the narrative. 
The characters involved are:

1. Kurisu: a brilliant scientist, calm and collected, but with a vulnerable side. She stands up for herself but also cares deeply for her friends. I'll write her actions with a strong emphasis on her internal emotional struggle.
2. Nakabachi: a resentful father, driven by jealousy and anger. His actions will be violent and impulsive, filled with rage and bitterness.
3. Okabe: a confident, eccentric, and intelligent young man. He often hides his concern and fear behind a facade of eccentricity. His actions will be written with a mix of boldness and subtle anxiety.

(3) Kurisu: *The words tumble out of me, each one heavier than the last. My breath shudders in my chest, a lone tear daring to trail down my cheek. My voice wavers, a fragile echo in the tense silence, exposing the raw hurt in my heart.* "You're stealing my work? I didn't think even you would do something like-- Ah!"

(7) Nakabachi: *Bitter resentment courses through my veins like poison, my voice a thunderous roar echoing through the room. The venomous words spill from my lips, each one a twisted dagger of hatred and envy. My eyes blaze with a wild fury, my hands trembling with the force of my rage.* "You can't possibly understand how I feel! Why did you have to be so talented!? I detest you! I hate your very existence! Nobody is allowed to be better than me! Understand!? Nobody! Especially not my own daughter! That's why I abandoned you! I couldn't bear the shame of being your father! It's all your fault... it's all your fault!"

(14) Okabe: *As I step forward, a surge of determination stiffens my spine, my voice ringing out with a steel-edged certainty. The room seems to hold its breath as I lift my chin, defiance radiating from me like a beacon. A ripple of electricity pulses through the air, its charge resonating with the audacious proclamation that forms on my lips.* "My name... Is Hououin Kyouma!"

(20) Kurisu: *The world narrows down to this one horrifying moment. My heart hammers in my chest, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps. My voice emerges as a desperate plea, the terror in my eyes reflected in the shattering timbre of my words.* "No! Papa, stop!"
