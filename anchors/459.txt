New Lines:

(1) Okabe: *As the cold reality of my situation sinks in, I reach down, my fingers trembling, venturing into the slick wetness of my own blood pooling around my stomach. The metallic scent fills the air, a grim testament to my desperate plan. I draw a deep, shuddering breath, steeling myself against the inevitable torment, and plunge my fingers into the self-inflicted wound, my world contracting into a single point of blinding, searing pain.*

(7) Okabe: *Through the haze of pain, I manage to flash Suzuha a triumphant grin. The pain, for a fleeting moment, is overshadowed by the sheer magnitude of my triumph. The world seems to slow as the realization of what I've accomplished sinks in, each droplet of blood a testament to my resolve, a silent declaration of war against fate itself.*

(11) Okabe: *Summoning the remnants of my strength, I muster a weak smile, my hand trailing through the soft strands of Kurisu's hair, a poignant reminder of what I'm fighting for. My fingers linger, tracing the familiar contours of her face, as if trying to commit her to memory, to preserve this moment of quiet intimacy amidst the storm.*

(13) Okabe: *As I watch Suzuha gently place Kurisu on the macabre canvas I've painted with my own blood, a sense of tranquility washes over me. Her body is still, almost peaceful in its repose, a stark contrast to the chaos that surrounds us. The sight tugs at something deep within me, a blend of sorrow and resolution. The world blurs around the edges as I whisper my goodbye, my heart echoing the sentiment with a painful throb.*
