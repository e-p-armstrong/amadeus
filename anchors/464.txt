(7) Okabe: *I nod, the single syllable of affirmation falling from my lips as a soft whisper in the quiet room. "...Yeah." A slow sigh escapes me, the air carrying away the last vestiges of resentment that once clung stubbornly to my heart. The icy tendrils of hatred that once coiled around my heart have melted away, leaving only a quiet acceptance in its wake. The unspoken pact of being good neighbors, of respecting each other's secrets, settles comfortably around us, an agreement sealed with a nod and a grateful smile. The warmth that radiates from Moeka, a warmth kindled by Nae's affection, is undeniable and I find myself drawn to it, an unexpected beacon of hope in our shared past. With one last glance over my shoulder, my gaze lingering on their retreating figures, I turn my attention back to the lab, the familiar hum of the microwave serving as a comforting lullaby to my tumultuous thoughts.*

(13) Okabe: *I extend my hand, accepting the chicken from Mayuri, the warmth seeping into my palm a welcome sensation against the cold reality of my past. I bring it to my lips, the taste of the chicken exploding in my mouth, a cascade of familiar flavors that almost brings tears to my eyes. The taste of home, of friendship, of simpler times. It's a stark contrast to the sterile, bland taste of hospital food that's been my companion for far too long. "Where did you get that microwave?" The question slips out, my gaze shifting from the chicken in my hand to the disassembled PhoneWave, the sight of it stirring a whirlpool of memories, each one more poignant than the last.*

(18) Okabe: *I reach out, my hand landing heavily on Itaru's back, the sound of our camaraderie echoing in the quiet room. "That's our super hacka." The words, spoken with genuine admiration and pride, hang in the air, a testament to our shared past and a promise of our shared future. The enthusiasm that bubbles within me is infectious, spreading to Itaru, sparking a fire in his eyes that matches my own. "Now let's keep up that pace and make the next Future Gadget." The challenge, thrown in the open, serves as a beacon, guiding us back to our shared passion, the very thing that binds us together.*

(21) Okabe: *I smirk, my eyes twinkling with mischief and affection, a playful retort dancing on the tip of my tongue. "You think you're my guardian now, Mayuri?" The teasing words, an echo of our shared past, roll off my tongue, a gentle reminder of the roles we've always played. "Hmph, you've certainly come up in the world." The pride in my voice is unmistakable, a testament to the young woman she's become, yet the protective instinct that's been a part of me since we were children refuses to fade. "Have you forgotten? I'm the one who protects you." The words, spoken with a gentle firmness, serve as a reminder of our bond, a bond forged in the fires of our shared past and tempered by the trials of our present.*
