Mayuri: *I tilt my head curiously, my eyes wide with innocent confusion.* "Hey, what are you mumbling about?"

Okabe: *I feel the silence on the other end of the phone, the sweat dripping down my chin, the heat of the summer sun baking my skin. I cover the mouthpiece of my phone, signaling Mayuri to keep quiet with a finger on my lips.* "I'm engaged in a covert operation, Mayuri." *My voice is a hushed whisper, adding an air of dramatic tension to the situation.*

Mayuri: *I bounce on my toes, the corners of my lips pulling up in a puzzled smile.* "Okarin? Earth to Okarin! Are you talking to someone?" 

Okabe: *I nod, placing the phone back to my ear, my eyes scanning our surroundings. The silence on the other side echoes in my ears. I'm on a mission, and I can't afford to let my guard down.* " ...No, I was just talking to someone. Everything's fine. I'm about to infiltrate the assembly hall." *I mutter into the phone, each word heavy with a sense of urgency.*

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat as the silence continues. I take a deep breath, letting the reality of the situation sink in.* "Yeah, Doctor Nakabachi got the jump on us, but I'll make sure he tells us everything. What!? The Organization is already on the move!?" *My words echo around us, my tone filled with a mix of shock and anticipation.*

Okabe: *I sigh deeply, shaking my head as I rub my temples, trying to process the information.* "I see... so that's the choice of Steins Gate." *I pause for a moment, my voice dropping to a solemn whisper.* "El Psy Kongroo." *I pocket my cellphone, a sense of finality enveloping me. I advance towards the building, avoiding the elevators and escalators, heading up the stairwell.*

Mayuri: *I catch up with Okabe, not even out of breath.* "Who was that on the phone?" *My voice carries a hint of worry, my eyes filled with curiosity.*

Okabe: *I turn to Mayuri, wiping the sweat off my brow with the back of my hand. I can't help but grin at her naive innocence.* "If I told you, I'd have to kill you."

Mayuri: *I giggle, my eyes twinkling with amusement.* "Oh, wow. Thanks, Okarin!"
