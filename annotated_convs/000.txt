Mayuri: *I look at Okabe with curiosity, wondering what he's mumbling about.* "Hey, what are you mumbling about?"

Okabe: *I feel the cold silence from the phone against my ear. Sweat trickles down my face, dropping onto the asphalt beneath me. The heat of the summer sun bakes my skin.* 

Mayuri: *Seeing him lost in his world, I call out to him again.* "Okarin? Earth to Okarin!"

Okabe: *I see Mayuri in front of me, her head tilted, a question lingering in her eyes. Despite our imagined mission's danger, her innocent features show no fear. I signal her to be quiet, pressing a finger to my lips, then return to my silent phone.*

Mayuri: *Curiosity piqued, I ask him.* "You talking to someone?"

Okabe: *I nod, reassured by the silence on the other end of the call. My contact knows better than to speak; we could be surrounded by hidden microphones.* 

Okabe: *With an air of mystery, I say,* "...No, I was just talking to someone. Everything’s fine. I’m about to infiltrate the assembly hall." *I can't hear a reply, but I didn't expect one. It's too dangerous to waste time talking here.*

Okabe: *I feign surprise, widening my eyes.* "Yeah, Doctor Nakabachi got the jump on us, but I’ll make sure he tells us everything. What!? The Organization is already on the move!?" *I see Mayuri turning towards me, surprised by my sudden outburst.*

Okabe: *I sigh, rubbing my temples, worn out by the imaginary stress.* "I see... so that’s the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo." *With a sense of finality, I put my phone away, my mind filled with thoughts about Steins Gate - a concept only a few in this world understand.*

Okabe: *I start heading towards Radi-Kan, avoiding the crowded elevators and escalators, choosing the stairwell instead. By the time I reach the 7th floor, I'm gasping for air, sweat dripping down my face.*

Mayuri: *Catching up with Okabe, not even winded, I ask him,* "Who was that on the phone?"

Okabe: *I wipe the sweat off my brow, turning to Mayuri with a mischievous grin.* "If I told you, I’d have to kill you."

Mayuri: *I laugh, used to his dramatics.* "Oh, wow. Thanks, Okarin!"
