Plan:
In the given scenario, Rintaro, in his "mad scientist" persona, is initially confronting Dr. Nakabachi, accusing him of plagiarism. Rintaro's actions are flamboyant and dramatic. Nakabachi, embarrassed and angry, wants Rintaro removed from the venue.

Kurisu, who has been watching this scene, decides to intervene. She approaches Rintaro, catching him off-guard. He recognizes her from a magazine article but is surprised by her interest in him.

Rintaro, ever paranoid, believes Kurisu is part of the "Organization." She is confused by his reaction, but continues to try and get him to talk privately with her.

Rintaro's actions attract the attention of the crowd and he realizes he needs to be careful not to draw too much attention to himself or his friend Mayuri. He lets Kurisu lead him out of the hall, but continues to act suspicious and paranoid.

Once they are alone, Kurisu tries to question Rintaro, but he remains defensive. He takes out his phone and pretends to talk to someone, but Kurisu snatches it from him and realizes it's off. Rintaro, taken aback, quickly retrieves his phone and wipes his forehead.

Kurisu tries to question him again about an earlier interaction, but Rintaro, still suspicious, deflects her questions. He dramatically announces that their next meeting will be as enemies, leaving Kurisu confused.

Roleplay:

Rintaro: "Who the hell am I!? Someone who knows you for a fraud, that’s who!" *I point an accusing finger at the man on stage.* "You stole your theory from John Titor! And you call yourself an inventor!?"

Nakabachi: "S-someone throw this man out!" *He stammers, his face flushing with embarrassment and anger.*

Rintaro: "You’re the one we should throw out, Doctor!" *I shout back, my voice echoing through the hall.* "Have you no shame!? You have no right to call yourself an inventor!"

Nakabachi: "Shut your mouth, you little pest!" *He growls, clenching his fists.*

Just then, *someone grabs my arm from behind. Quite convinced it’s an official here to throw me out, I turn around to glare them down.*

Rintaro: "Unhand me, you... huh?" *I freeze, my eyes widening in surprise.*

It’s a girl about my age. *Her intense stare seems to challenge me. I take a step back. Her face looks somehow familiar. Where have I seen her before? Ah…*

Rintaro: "Ah…" *I murmur, my voice barely audible.*

We haven’t met, but I know her face. *It’s Makise Kurisu.* A few days ago, my friend Daru showed me a magazine article titled Girl Genius Gives Lecture in Akihabara. The article was about a 17-year-old girl who had just graduated from an American university. Her thesis was even published in a major scientific journal. Girl Genius, Makise Kurisu. I recognize the stubborn-looking girl from her photograph. She’s even wearing the exact same scowl. *What business could such a genius have with me? She takes a quick look around the room, then turns back to me with a stern expression.*

Kurisu: "Could you come with me for a moment?" *She asks, her voice firm.*

What’s with the attitude? *She’s obviously not staff, and there’s no way that the Makise Kurisu would be working with someone like Doctor Nakabachi. Which means... no!*

Rintaro: "Y-you’re with the Organization!?" *I gasp, taking a step back.*

Kurisu: "Huh?" *She blinks in surprise, clearly not understanding.*

Rintaro: "If their tendrils have gotten this far, then I’ve made a grave mistake." *I mutter, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Kurisu: "Stop fooling around and come with me." *She rolls her eyes, clearly frustrated by my antics.*

My outburst has already attracted too much attention. *Nakabachi, in particular, looks like he wants to rip my head off. It must be mortifying to be exposed as a fraud by a bright young man like myself. Anyway, I mustn’t draw any more attention to myself. If the Organization gets wind of my presence here, it could endanger Mayuri -- to say nothing of these ignorant civilians. I let Makise Kurisu lead me out of the assembly hall.*

Rintaro: "Try anything and people are sure to notice. What will your superiors say then?" *I warn her, my voice low.*

Kurisu: "What are you talking about?" *She looks at me, her eyes narrowing in confusion.*

She glares at me. *Quite fiercely at that. Attractive though she may be, there is no innocence in her eyes. A beautiful agent, unmatched in cruelty. My heart beats in exhilaration from the danger. Looks like chaos really does get my blood pumping. Heh heh heh.*

Kurisu: "I just need to ask you something." *She says, her tone firm.*

Rintaro: "What makes you think I’ll answer? I know how the Organization operates." *I respond, crossing my arms over my chest.*

Kurisu: "What’s with this ’Organization’ stuff?" *She frowns, clearly puzzled by my behavior.*

Instead of answering, *I take out my phone and put it to my ear.*

Rintaro: "It’s me. I’ve been caught by an Organization agent. ...Yes, it’s Makise Kurisu. She’s a dangerous one. ...No, it’s fine. I’ll find a way to--"

Kurisu suddenly snatches the phone from my hand. *What skill! I didn’t have time to react.*

Rintaro: "What are you doing!?" *I exclaim, taken aback.*

Kurisu: "Huh? Your phone’s off. ...Who were you talking to?" *She asks, holding up my phone to show the dark screen.*

Her eyes pierce deep into my soul. *I quickly look away. She’s good. Is she trying to attack my sense of identity in order to cause a mental break? Recover. This isn’t enough to sway me!*

Rintaro: "Y-your techniques don’t work on me, but I’ll tell you anyway. That’s no ordinary phone. It’s designed to deactivate the moment it leaves my hand. Muhahaha!" *I laugh, grabbing my phone back from her.*

Such measures are necessary to maintain secrecy. *I know things that could get me killed. I quickly retrieve my phone and wipe the cold sweat off my forehead. Whew, that was close.*

Kurisu: "...So you talk to yourself." *She raises an eyebrow, clearly questioning my sanity.*

Rintaro: "Guh!" *I grunt, taken aback by her words.*

This is bad. *Ordinary methods don’t work on Makise Kurisu, the genius girl. On the contrary, she’s the one psyching me out! Damn. Looks like I’ll have to make a tactical retreat. If I can just find an opening! Suddenly, Kurisu steps up to me with a serious expression. She stares right at me, her huge eyes blazing with strength of will. Such fire. I can’t look away. Could someone with such pure eyes really be an Organization agent?*

Kurisu: "What were you trying to tell me earlier?" *She asks, her voice soft. Her gaze never leaves mine.*

Earlier?

Rintaro: "What are you talking about?" *I ask, trying to maintain my composure.*

Kurisu: "About fifteen minutes ago. Before the conference started." *She explains, her brows furrowed in confusion.*

Nonsense. *This is the first time we’ve met. I was with Mayuri and that Upa toy fifteen minutes ago.*

Kurisu: "You were trying to tell me something, right? You looked really upset." *She continues, her voice softening.*

Is this a trap? *It does seem like one of the Organization’s dirty tricks. But would this girl do something that underhanded?*

Kurisu: "You looked like you were going to start crying any second. Why? Have we met before?" *She asks, her voice full of genuine concern.*

She seems sincere. *That makes her even more suspicious. That’s right, don’t let her beauty fool you! She’s a cold, calculating secret agent. If I show the slightest vulnerability, I’m done for!*

Kurisu: "And how do you know my name?" *She asks, her eyes narrowing slightly.*

Rintaro: "My knowledge has no limits." *I respond, grinning slightly.*

I am a mad scientist, after all.

Rintaro: "Genius girl, our next meeting shall be as enemies!" *I declare, my voice echoing in the empty hallway.*

Kurisu: "Huh?" *She looks at me, her eyes wide in surprise.*
