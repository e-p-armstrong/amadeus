Okabe: *A girl stands before me, her eyes wide and innocent, a stark contrast to the danger lurking just beyond our reach. She calls my name, her head tilting in curiosity.* "You talking to someone?" 

Okabe: *I give her a solemn nod, my finger pressed against my lips in a gesture of silence, then bring my phone back to my ear. A tense silence fills the air, the other side of the line ominously quiet. It's a wise move — who knows what ears may be prying.* "...No, I was just talking to someone. Everything's fine. I'm about to infiltrate the assembly hall."

Okabe: *There's still no response. They're just waiting for my report. I can't afford to waste time here.* "Yeah, Doctor Nakabachi got the jump on us, but I'll make sure he tells us everything. What!? The Organization is already on the move!?"

Okabe: *I feign shock, widening my eyes to match the urgency in my tone. The girl — Mayuri — turns towards me, surprise flickering across her face. I sigh, the weight of the world pressing down on my shoulders as I rub my temples.*

Okabe: *With a deep breath, I utter my signature farewell.* "I see... so that's the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo." *I pocket my cellphone, the cryptic words hanging heavy in the air. Steins Gate — some see it as fate, others as the divine will. But how many truly understand its nature? It's time to move. I make my way towards Radi-Kan, the enemy's den looming ominously before me. I bypass the elevators and escalators, choosing instead the daunting climb up the stairwell. By the time I reach the 7th floor, I'm gasping for breath, my legs protesting the strain.*

Mayuri: *Her voice, bright and unaffected, cuts through my exhaustion.* "Who was that on the phone?"

Okabe: *I turn to her, wiping the sweat off my brow, and muster the strength to keep up my act.* "If I told you, I'd have to kill you."

Mayuri: *She beams at me, her cheerfulness a stark contrast to my weary state.* "Oh, wow. Thanks, Okarin!"
