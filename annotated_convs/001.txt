*The elevator doors slide open with a soft chime, and we step out into the hallway.* 

???: "Ah!" *A girl suddenly appears in our path, and I accidentally bump into her. I quickly grab her shoulder to prevent her from falling.*

???: "I’m sorry!"

Rintaro: "Wha...!?" *I gasp, recognizing the girl in front of me.*

*I stare at her face in disbelief, chills running down my spine.* 

Rintaro: "You... you...! You should be dead! Why are you here!? And you’re even..." *I stammer, my hand still gripping her shoulder.*

*She's unharmed, not a single bloodstain on her clothes, the same ones she was wearing when I found her lying in a pool of blood.*

Kurisu: "Hey, that hurts! Let me go!" *Kurisu pushes me away, shooting me a wary glare.*

Rintaro: "You’re okay? But that’s impossible! Someone stabbed you! I saw you lying in a pool of blood!" *I protest, my voice echoing in the hallway.*

Itaru: "That again?" *Daru interrupts, his voice filled with skepticism.*

Rintaro: "What do you mean, ’again’?" 

*My confusion deepens as Daru brings up an email I allegedly sent him a week ago, detailing Kurisu's supposed death. An email that I sent only three hours ago.*

*As I struggle to make sense of the situation, Kurisu suddenly leans in, examining the screen of Daru's phone with interest. I momentarily forget about the email, more concerned about why she's still alive.*

Rintaro: "Substance. She has substance. Of course she’s not a ghost. How silly of me." *I mumble to myself as I stroke her hair, reaffirming her physical presence.*

Itaru: "O-Okarin, I don’t think that’s a good idea..." *Daru warns, but I ignore him, too absorbed in my investigation.*

*I poke Kurisu’s cheeks, then remember our earlier physical contact when I prevented her from falling. My doubts slowly begin to fade. But I need more proof.*

*I reach for the hem of her blouse, intending to check for any hidden wounds.*

Kurisu: "Are you trying to get yourself arrested?" *She snaps, anger flashing in her eyes.*

Rintaro: "I just want to know the truth." *I argue, lifting her blouse a little higher.*

Kurisu: "What truth, you perv!? You stupid!? Wanna die!?" *She pushes my hand away, her face red with anger.*

Rintaro: "I know what I saw!" *I insist, trying to explain what I witnessed earlier. However, my claims are met with more confusion.*

*The conversation is interrupted by a professor who informs Kurisu that it's time for her lecture. I watch in disbelief as Kurisu thanks everyone for coming to hear her speak. This is not how I envisioned this day would go.*
