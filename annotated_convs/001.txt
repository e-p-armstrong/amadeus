Okabe: *I run a hand through my hair, frustration seeping into my features.* "How many times do I have to tell you? Don't call me Okarin."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, a look of innocent confusion on my face.* "Huh? But I've always called you that."

Okabe: *I throw my arms out wide, a grand gesture to accompany my grand proclamation.* "That was then! I have since become Hououin Kyouma, the insane mad scientist hunted by secret organizations the world over. Muhahaha!" *I end my declaration with a maniacal laugh, echoing in the empty hall.*

Mayuri: *I giggle, finding Okabe's theatrics amusing.* "But that's too hard to remember."

Okabe: *I cross my arms, a smirk playing on my lips as I contemplate my next words.* "In any case, Hououin Kyouma is my true name."

Mayuri: *I giggle again, shaking my head at Okabe's antics.* "And besides, it doesn't even sound like Okabe Rintaro. You're weird, ehehe!" 

Okabe: *I huff, feigning offense at her laughter.* "Cease your foolish laughter! Okabe Rintaro may be my real name, but I have rejected it, for it is stupid. And so I also hate the derivative Okarin. Come on, it sounds like that elf boy's blue pipe thing."

Mayuri: *I blink, still smiling, and tilt my head.* "So, Okarin, can I ask you something?"

Okabe: *I sigh, shaking my head at her persistent use of the nickname.* "In one ear and out the other. She's been calling me that for five years now, so maybe it's time to give up."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a look of genuine curiosity in my eyes.* "What are we doing here?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, surprised at her question.* "Wait. You followed me here without knowing why?"

Mayuri: *I nod, not a trace of embarrassment on my face.* "Yup."

Okabe: *I glance around the hall, taking in the lack of reporters.* "We're here for Doctor Nakabachi's press conference."

Mayuri: *I look around, my eyebrows furrowing slightly in confusion.* "Press conference? But where are the reporters?"

Okabe: *I smirk, a dark chuckle escaping my lips.* "Could this be the Organization working its twisted influence?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, not understanding his dramatic statement.* "You wrapped something? Is it his birthday too? Ehehe!"

Okabe: *I sigh, shaking my head at her innocent misunderstanding.* "Keep your guard up, Mayuri. I suspect this won't be a normal conference--"
