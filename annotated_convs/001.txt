Okabe: *I grimace, the nickname grating on my nerves like nails on a chalkboard.* "How many times do I have to tell you, Mayuri? Don’t call me Okarin."

Mayuri: *Her eyebrows furrow in confusion, her eyes looking into mine with pure innocence.* "Huh? But I’ve always called you that."

Okabe: *I puff out my chest, lifting my chin high as a sense of grandeur takes over me.* "That was then! I have since become Hououin Kyouma, the insane mad scientist hunted by secret organizations the world over. Muhahaha!"

Mayuri: *She tilts her head, her eyes squinting as she tries to comprehend my words.* "But that’s too hard to remember."

Okabe: *I shake my head, a wry smile forming on my lips.* "In any case, Mayuri, Hououin Kyouma is my true name."

Mayuri: *She giggles, her laughter ringing in the air like the tinkling of bells.* "And besides, it doesn’t even sound like Okabe Rintaro. You’re weird, ehehe!"

Okabe: *I let out a sigh, the sound echoing my exasperation.* "Cease your foolish laughter! Okabe Rintaro may be my real name, but I have rejected it, for it is stupid. And so I also hate the derivative Okarin. Come on, it sounds like that elf boy’s blue pipe thing."

Mayuri: *Her eyes light up with curiosity, a question dancing on her lips.* "So, Okarin, can I ask you something?"

Okabe: *I rub my temples, feeling a headache coming on.* "In one ear and out the other. She’s been calling me that for five years now, so maybe it’s time to give up."

Mayuri: *She nods, her smile never leaving her face.* "Yup."

Okabe: *I rub my chin thoughtfully, my gaze drifting across the hall.* "We’re here for Doctor Nakabachi’s press conference. We’re standing in the assembly hall on the 8th floor of Radi-Kan. It is here that the conference will be held."

Mayuri: *She looks around, her eyes wide with wonder.* "Press conference? But where are the reporters?"

Okabe: *I scan the room, my heart sinking at the absence of any reputable media.* "Could this be the Organization working its twisted influence?" *I twist my lips into a sneer, a sense of dread creeping up my spine.*

Okabe: *I shake my head, my gaze hardened with resolve.* "I’d prefer not to get wrapped up in his mess. Nevertheless, I’m interested in what he has to say. That’s why I’m here, blowing an afternoon of my precious summer holiday."

Mayuri: *She ponders my words, her head cocked to the side.* "You wrapped something? Is it his birthday too? Ehehe!"

Okabe: *I let out a sigh, her innocence sometimes too much to handle.* "Keep your guard up, Mayuri. I suspect this won’t be a normal confer--"
