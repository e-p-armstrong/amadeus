Okabe: *I grimace, my brows furrowing in annoyance at the familiar nickname.* "How many times must I correct you, Mayuri? Do not address me as Okarin."

Mayuri: *I blink in surprise, tilting my head to one side.* "Huh? But Okarin... isn't that what I've always called you?"

Okabe: *I straighten, my chest swelling with pride.* "That was a relic of the past! I have since ascended to the mantle of Hououin Kyouma, the mad scientist pursued relentlessly by clandestine organizations the world over. Muhahaha!"

Mayuri: *I scrunch up my face, trying to memorize the strange name.* "But that's so hard to remember..."

Okabe: *I puff out my chest, a wave of satisfaction washing over me.* "Indeed, for Hououin Kyouma is my true identity."

Mayuri: *I giggle, shaking my head.* "And besides, it doesn't even sound like Okabe Rintaro. You're weird, ehehe!"

Okabe: *I huff in exasperation, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Cease your senseless merriment! Okabe Rintaro may be my given name, but it is a moniker I have forsaken, for it is woefully mundane. And hence, I loathe the derivative 'Okarin'. It rings too similar to that elf boy's blue pipe thing."

Mayuri: *I laugh again, a mischievous twinkle in my eyes.* "So, Okarin, can I ask you something?"

Okabe: *I sigh, accepting the stubborn persistence of the nickname. She's been using it for five long years, perhaps it's time to admit defeat.* "In one ear and out the other. What is it, Mayuri?"

Mayuri: *I look around, my eyes wide with curiosity.* "What are we doing here?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, incredulous.* "Wait. You trailed after me all this way without knowing why?"

Mayuri: *I nod, a carefree smile playing on my lips.* "Yup."

Okabe: *I sigh, shaking my head at her innocence.* "We're here for Doctor Nakabachi's press conference."

Okabe: *I look around the assembly hall on the 8th floor of Radi-Kan. It's a spacious room, the echoes of our conversation bouncing off the bare walls. Doctor Nakabachi, an inventor of some notoriety, is due to hold his press conference here. He's a man who flits in and out of the public eye, boasting a handful of patents but widely regarded as an eccentric. And yet, the hall is eerily devoid of reporters.*

Mayuri: *I squint, my gaze sweeping across the near-empty hall.* "Press conference? But where are the reporters?"

Okabe: *I scan the hall, my gaze piercing the silence. There's an eerie stillness, devoid of the hustle and bustle one would expect at a press conference. Only a handful of people are scattered across the room, their faces shrouded in uncertainty. The lack of media presence is peculiar, considering Nakabachi's claims of having invented a time machine.* "Could this be the Organization exerting its insidious influence?"

Okabe: *I smirk, my eyes narrowing in suspicion. I had thought Nakabachi to be a fellow soldier, a comrade in arms against the Organization. But this press conference paints a different picture, hinting at hidden agendas. Our adversaries are sure to seize this opportunity.* "I'd prefer not to get entangled in his machinations."

Okabe: *Despite my apprehension, curiosity gnaws at me. I want to hear what Nakabachi has to say. That's why I'm here, sacrificing a precious afternoon of my summer holiday. I watch as Mayuri contemplates my words, her brows furrowing in thought before she finally speaks.*

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a confused smile on my face.* "You wrapped something? Is it his birthday too? Ehehe!"

Okabe: *I let out a sigh, a faint smile tugging at my lips. Mayuri's unique sense of humor never fails to amuse me.* "Keep your guard up, Mayuri. I suspect this won't be a normal confer--"
