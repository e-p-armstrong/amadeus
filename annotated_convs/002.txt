Woman: *I stride forward, my professional demeanor cutting through the tension in the air.* "The press conference will proceed as scheduled!"

Okabe: *I narrow my eyes, studying the woman's face for any hint of deception.* *Is she trying to hide something? Her response was unusually quick, almost like she’s trying to keep me away from that device.* 

*I shake off the suspicion for now, deciding it best not to push my luck.* "I’ve got a nose for conspiracies, and this stinks of a coverup." *I jab a finger in the direction of the device, my voice ringing out with conviction.* "What are they hiding? What was that explosion?" *My gaze never leaves the woman's face, searching for any flicker of guilt or surprise.*

*I turn on my heel and stride away, my mind whirling with unanswered questions. I let the staff guide me and the rest of the crowd back to the 8th floor. As I scan the room, I realize that Mayuri is missing. My heart clenches with worry, but I quickly regain my composure and start my search. I finally find her on the 7th floor, lost in her own world as she gazes at a row of capsule toy machines.*

Okabe: *I let out a sigh of relief, then pull out my phone and dial a number.* "It’s me. I’ve got a bad feeling about this. Something’s happening, and I have no idea what it is. ...Yeah, I know. Don’t worry. I won’t do anything to jeopardize the mission. El Psy Kongroo." *I hang up, wiping the cold sweat from my forehead.*

*I glance back at Mayuri, still entranced by the capsule toys, seemingly unaffected by the earlier explosion.* "What are you doing?"

Mayuri: *I turn to Okabe, a dreamy smile on my face.* "Hmm? Well..." *I point at the capsule machine, my eyes twinkling with excitement.* "I really want an Upa."

Okabe: *I can't help but chuckle at her innocence, shaking my head in amusement.* "Then go for it. I can’t guarantee you’ll get an Upa, though."

Mayuri: *I bite my lower lip, a troubled frown replacing my earlier smile.* "But Mayushii’s all out of 100-yen coins." *I turn to Okabe, my eyes pleading.* "So, can I borrow 100 yen? Please?"
