Plan: This scene opens with Okabe and Kurisu exiting an elevator, unexpectedly bumping into each other. Okabeâ€™s disbelief and shock seeing Kurisu alive should be clearly shown through his actions. Kurisu, on the other hand, is confused and slightly annoyed by Okabe's grip on her shoulder and his seemingly irrational accusations. Daru, their mutual friend, who is also present in the scene, has a somewhat comical and laid-back attitude, which should be reflected in his actions. 

Roleplay:

Okabe: *A chime signals our arrival on the 5th floor. The elevator doors open slowly. As we step out of the elevator--* "Ah!" *I exclaim as I bump into someone and quickly grab their shoulder to keep them from falling.*

Kurisu: "I'm sorry!" *She apologizes, looking a bit flustered.*

Okabe: "Wha...!?" *I gasp, recognizing the girl I just bumped into.* "You... you...!" *I stammer, my grip on her shoulder tightening as cold chills run down my spine.*

Kurisu: "Is there something wrong?" *She looks at me with concern, trying to pull away from my grip.*

Okabe: *Ignoring her attempt to free herself, I tighten my grip.* "Y-you... You should be dead! Why are you here!? And you're even..." *I trail off, observing her unscathed body and clothes.*

Kurisu: "Hey, that hurts! Let me go!" *She protests and finally manages to push me away, shooting me a wary glare.*

Okabe: "You're okay? But that's impossible! Someone stabbed you! I saw you lying in a pool of blood!" *I blurt out, still in disbelief.*

Itaru: "That again?" *He interrupts, looking confused.*

Okabe: "What do you mean, 'again'?" *I glance at him, puzzled by his comment.*

Itaru: "I mean, you sent me that email like a week ago, right?" *He shrugs, pulling out his phone.*

Okabe: "I sent you an email? Don't be ridiculous! I saw her dead just three hours ago!" *I exclaim, frustration creeping into my voice.*

Kurisu: "Hey! Could you not talk about me like that? I'm perfectly fine." *She snaps, clearly annoyed by my outburst.*

Itaru: "You know, that message was kinda weird. It was dated a week after I got it, which means it came from the future." *He says, showing his phone to me.*

Kurisu: "It came from the future?" *She questions, sounding intrigued.*

Okabe: "That sounds like something you'd read on the internet, Daru. It's rare for you to talk about ridiculous theories." *I scoff, dismissing his claim.*

Itaru: "No, the date was definitely a week later. It came from, uh... the 28th. Wait. That's today!" *He exclaims, showing me the email on his phone.*

Okabe: "This is the email I sent you three hours ago." *I say, looking at the screen of Daru's phone.*

Kurisu: "Interesting..." *Suddenly, she's standing next to me, peering intently at the screen of Daru's phone.*

Okabe: *Ignoring the email for the moment, I reach out to touch Kurisu's face.* "Substance. She has substance. Of course she's not a ghost. How silly of me." *I mutter, poking her cheeks.*

Itaru: "O-Okarin, I don't think that's a good idea..." *He warns, looking uncomfortable.*

Kurisu: "...Hey." *She says, looking at me with a mix of annoyance and confusion.*
