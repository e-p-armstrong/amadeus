Okabe: *With a sense of dramatic flourish, I pull out a 100-yen coin, feel its cold metallic touch, and set it into the machine’s slot, spinning the lever with an exaggerated twist of my wrist.*

Mayuri: *Her eyes widen in anticipation, a soft gasp escaping her lips.* "Ah, ahh..."

Okabe: *My fingers deftly open the capsule, revealing the contents. I hold it up, catching the light as Mayuri leans forward, her eyes sparkling with eagerness.*

Mayuri: *Her face lights up with pure joy.* "It’s an Upa! And it’s metal! A Metal Upa!"

Okabe: *I arch an eyebrow, feigning disinterest.* "Is it rare?"

Mayuri: *She nods her head vigorously, her voice filled with excitement.* "Super rare!"

Okabe: *I examine the Metal Upa, feeling its cool weight in my hand. A young boy, who had been watching us, tries his luck on the same RaiNet machine, only to reveal a normal Upa. He looks at my Metal Upa with a glimmer of envy in his eyes, but my attention is drawn to Mayuri, her eyes still fixed on the Upa with childlike wonder.*

Okabe: *With a dramatic sigh, I extend my hand, offering the Metal Upa to her.* "Hmph. I give this creature of metal to you, Mayuri."

Mayuri: *Her eyes grow wide with surprise.* "Really!? Are you sure, Okarin?"

Okabe: *I puff out my chest, a playful scowl on my face.* "The name’s Hououin Kyouma!"

Mayuri: *She giggles, her eyes shimmering with gratitude.* "Ehehe! Thank you, Okarin."

Okabe: *A voice echoes from above, announcing the start of Doctor Nakabachi’s Time Machine Press Conference. I rise, my cloak billowing behind me.* "Sounds like they’re starting."

Okabe: *I stride towards the stairs, but a glance over my shoulder reveals Mayuri still engrossed with the Metal Upa.* "Let’s go, Mayuri."

Mayuri: *She looks up, her fingers still tracing over the Upa.* "Mm... just a sec. I gotta write my name."

Okabe: *I shake my head, a fond smile on my face, and ascend the stairs without her.*

Presenter: *A man walks onto the stage, his face twisted in a frown, sparse applause echoing around the room.* "Without further ado, I am pleased to introduce the inventor, Doctor Nakabachi! Please welcome him with a big round of applause!"

Nakabachi: *With a confident stride, I approach the podium, grabbing the microphone.* "I am Doctor Nakabachi. Thank you all for coming."

Nakabachi: *I clear my throat, my voice echoing through the room.* "Now then, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin with my theory of time travel, the greatest scientific breakthrough of the century."

Mayuri: *She scurries up to me, a question in her eyes.* "Did he really build a time machine?"

Okabe: *I survey the room, my eyes narrowing at the lack of media presence, my expectations plummeting as Nakabachi begins to explain his time machine design.*

Okabe: *With a roar of indignation, I interrupt Nakabachi, my voice echoing in the stunned silence.* "DOOOOOCTOOOOOOOORRR!!"

Okabe: *I point accusingly at Nakabachi, my voice filled with contempt.* "Do you take us for fools!?"

Nakabachi: *I glare at the man, my voice dripping with disdain.* "Who the hell are you?"

Okabe: *I step forward, my voice ringing with conviction.* "Who the hell am I!? Someone who knows you for a fraud, that’s who! You stole your theory from John Titor! And you call yourself an inventor!?"
