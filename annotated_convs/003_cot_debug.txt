Okabe: "I just want to know the truth," *I insist, looking straight into Kurisu's eyes and lifting her blouse a little higher.*

Kurisu: "What truth, you perv!? You stupid!? Wanna die!?" *She snaps, pushing my hand away with a look of disgust.*

Itaru: "Louise-chan's famous line for the win!" *He shouts, trying to lighten the situation with a joke.*

Okabe: "I know what I saw!" *I ignore Daru's comment and continue pressing Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "No way! Did you just see my underw...!?" *Her face turns bright red and she firmly pulls her blouse down.*

Okabe: "No, you fool! Not that!" *Seeing her misunderstanding, I quickly explain the incident I witnessed earlier.*

Kurisu: "Wait. Doctor Nakabachi?" *She asks, confusion clear in her voice.*

Itaru: "What are you talking about, Okarin? Doctor Nakabachi's presentation was canceled." *He interjects, looking curiously at me.*

Okabe: "Canceled!?" *My eyes widen in surprise. I had no idea about this.*

Itaru: "Yeah. Because of the satellite crash," *He clarifies, as if it's the most obvious thing in the world.*

Okabe: "My name... is Hououin Kyouma!" *I declare, trying to regain control of the situation.*

Itaru: "Really, man? You're hopeless..." *He sighs, shaking his head in disbelief.*

Kurisu: "Okay, Hououin-san. I'd like to hear your story in more detail." *She finally says, her tone softening a bit.*

Professor: "Makise-san? It's almost time." *An older man steps out of the assembly hall.*

Kurisu: "Huh? Oh, right. Thank you." *She quickly composes herself and heads towards the small conference room.*

Itaru: "We should go too." *He suggests, following after Kurisu.*

Okabe: "Go where?" *I ask, not really sure what he is talking about.*

Itaru: "To hear the lecture, duh?" *He replies, rolling his eyes at my cluelessness.*

Kurisu: "Um, I'd like to thank everyone for coming to hear me speak today." *She begins her lecture, her voice slightly shaky from nerves.*

Okabe: "She's the one giving the lecture..." *I realize, taken aback by this revelation.*

Kurisu: "It's my first time giving a lecture like this, so please forgive me if I'm a little nervous." *She continues, trying to hide her discomfort.*

Okabe: *I notice her stealing a glance at me, but I don't care. Even if the audience is fooled by her act, I still don't like her.*

Kurisu: "For today's lecture, I've been asked to speak on the subject of time travel. It's not really my area of expertise, but I'll try my best." *She moves on to the topic of her lecture, trying to regain control of the situation.*

Okabe: "Time travel? Oh-ho..." *I chuckle, intrigued by the topic.*

Kurisu: "Let me start by saying that time travel is an absurd concept." *She begins, trying to set the tone for her lecture.*

Okabe: "OBJECTION!" *I interject, unable to contain my disagreement.*

Kurisu: "Hwa...!?" *She jumps in surprise, clearly not expecting my interruption.*
