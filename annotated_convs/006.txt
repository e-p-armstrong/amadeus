Okabe: *I slam the phone down in frustration, my fingers white from gripping it so tightly.* "Dammit, Mayuri. Why won’t you pick up?" *I groan, rubbing my temples to ease the growing headache.*

Okabe: *A heavy sigh escapes my lips as the realization hits me.* "Looks like I’ll have to go back to the assembly hall. But things will get messy if I bump heads with Makise Kurisu again."

Okabe: *My eyes widen, a sudden, dramatic thought striking me.* "Wait, don’t tell me! Did that femme fatale kidnap Mayuri!? Damn you! Is that how the Organization operates!?" *I shake my fist at the imaginary enemy, a mix of anger and concern flooding me.*

Okabe: *I start pacing, my mind racing with possibilities.* "Leaving without Mayuri isn’t an option. Call me overprotective, but she’s like a little sister to me, and there’s a very real danger that she might wander off somewhere the moment I let her out of my sight. Mayuri has always been like that. I never know if she’ll be there when I turn to look. ...In a sense, that’s why I became Hououin Kyouma."

Okabe: *I stop pacing, my decision made.* "I have to go back for her."

Okabe: *My heart sinks as I climb back up to the 8th floor, the weight of the situation pressing down on me.* "The thought of climbing back up to the 8th floor is depressing, but I have no choice. When I get back to the assembly hall, Doctor Nakabachi’s conference has just finished. Nobody is on stage, and the phony inventor has already left. The 20 or so members of the audience are starting to pack up. I soon find Mayuri. She’s in the corner, looking lost. Well, at least she wasn’t kidnapped. Even better, I don’t see Makise Kurisu anywhere."

Okabe: *A smug grin tugs at my lips.* "Heh, looks like I scared her off. So be it. I’ll let her go this time."

Okabe: *Keeping my guard up, I make my way over to Mayuri.* "Mayuri! Why didn’t you pick up? We’re leaving."

Mayuri: *I turn to him, my face forlorn.* "Okarin! My Metal Upa ran away."

Okabe: *I arch an eyebrow at her.* "Ran away? What, it’s alive? That’s a little hard to believe."

Mayuri: *I shuffle my feet, looking down.* "I think I dropped it..."

Okabe: *A sigh escapes my lips.* "I see, so she was looking for it. Not like it really matters." *I wave my hand dismissively.* "Forget about it. You can always get another one."

Mayuri: *I shake my head, my eyes welling up.* "No way. Metal Upas sell upwards of 10, 000 yen online, you know?"

Okabe: *My eyes widen in shock.* "Wait... what?"

Okabe: *I grasp her by the shoulders, my voice urgent.* "Think, Mayuri! Where did you drop it!?"

Mayuri: *Tears well up in my eyes as I shake my head.* "I don’t know! That’s why I’m looking. And even if we find it, you can’t sell it, okay?"

Okabe: *A wicked grin spreads across my face.* "Muhahaha! That 10, 000 yen will fund my research!"

Mayuri: *I cross my arms, trying to look stern.* "I said you can’t sell it! It even has Mayushii’s name on it."

Okabe: *I laugh again, the hunt for the Metal Upa proving to be a welcome distraction.* "Thus begins our search for the Metal Upa."

Mayuri: *I start to wander around, my voice light and hopeful.* "Tutturu♪ Upa, Upa, come out, come out, wherever you are!"
