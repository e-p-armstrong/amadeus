Planning:
- Mayuri is a cheerful, bubbly, and innocent character. Her actions should reflect her carefree nature, and her dialogue should be light and somewhat naive.
- Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, and he often acts eccentric and dramatic. However, in this scene, he's thrown into a serious situation, so his thoughts and actions should reflect the growing tension and fear.
- The Distant Voice is an unknown character. The scream is a plot device to create suspense and draw Okabe into the situation. 
- Anchor lines: Okabe's discovery of Kurisu's body will be the first anchor, signifying the dramatic turn of events. The second anchor will be Okabe's denial of the situation, representing his shock and confusion.
- Word choices for Okabe should reflect his analytical nature, with an undertone of fear and suspense. Mayuri's actions should be simple and direct, mirroring her straightforward personality.

Roleplay:

Mayuri: *I giggle, my eyes twinkling with mirth as I poke Okabe's arm playfully.* "Sounds like you, Okarin!"

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, my eyebrows shooting up in disbelief. A chuckle escapes my lips before I can stop it.* "Woah, wasn’t expecting that from Mayuri."

A sudden, blood-curdling scream pierces the silence, causing my heart to skip a beat.

Distant Voice: "AHHHHHHHHHHH!"

Okabe: *My body jerks in surprise, a chill running down my spine as I scan the area.* "!?" *I question out loud, the confusion apparent in my tone.* "Wh-what was that?"

Mayuri: *I glance at Okabe, my eyes wide with fear as I clutch the fabric of my dress tightly.* "Was that a scream?"

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my heart pounding in my chest as I survey the assembly hall. There are only a handful of people left, their expressions mirroring my own concern.* "I think so... Only the presenter and a few other people are left in the assembly hall. Including Mayuri and me, less than half the audience remains." *I glance around, noting the anxious looks on everyone's faces.* "Everyone looks at each other anxiously, startled by the scream. Even I cannot suppress a shiver." *My thoughts race as I try to piece together the events.* "First the explosion on the roof. Now this. What’s going on here?" *I feel Mayuri's hand squeeze mine, her fear palpable.* "Mayuri squeezes my hand tight."

Okabe: *I turn to Mayuri, my expression serious.* "Stay here, Mayuri!" *I command, my voice firm.*

Okabe: *Taking a deep breath to steady my nerves, I cautiously make my way towards the source of the scream. The eerie echo guides me down a dimly lit hallway on the same floor.* "I take a deep breath, prepare myself, and head in the direction of the scream." *I crouch down, peeking around the corner with bated breath. A figure lies motionless at the end of the hallway, their familiar clothing making my heart sink.* "And there, at the end of the passage, I see it. There’s something on the ground. No... someone. Motionless. Who is it?" *Recognition hits me like a punch to the gut, my breath hitching in my throat.* "The clothes are familiar. ...It can’t be."

Okabe: *My voice comes out as a whisper, my mind struggling to accept the reality in front of me.* "Wha..."

Okabe: *I crouch down next to Kurisu, my hands shaking as I take in the sight. The vibrant genius girl I had just argued with was now lifeless, her body soaked in a pool of blood.* "Makise Kurisu... Her face is turned away, but I know it’s her. The impertinent genius girl I just fought with ten minutes ago... ...is now face down in a pool of bright red blood." *I choke on my words, the reality sinking in.* "She’s dead."

Okabe: *I shake my head, my voice barely a whisper as I refuse to accept the situation.* "No... but... why?"
