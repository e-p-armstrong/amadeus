Okabe: *My heart races as I take in the implications of the experiment's unexpected result.* "A teleporter... we've invented a teleporter!"

Kurisu: "Oh?" *Her voice echoes from the lounge, surprising everyone present.* "That looks like an interesting experiment."

Okabe: *I turn abruptly towards the voice, my eyes wide with surprise.* "Who's there!?" 

Kurisu: *She steps forward, her sharp gaze meeting mine.* 

Okabe: "Impossible! What are you doing here!?" *I point an accusing finger at her, my voice filled with disbelief.* "The 18-year-old genius girl! A sadist who humiliates men in public! Also known as The Zombie! Makise... Kurisu!"

Itaru: *He snorts, clearly amused by my outburst.* "Nice exposition, bro."

Kurisu: "Who are you calling a zombie?" *She crosses her arms, a hint of annoyance flickering in her eyes.*

Okabe: "What is the meaning of this!?" *I take a step back, my gaze darting between her and Itaru.* "What is your purpose here?"

Kurisu: "I'm here to see you, Okabe Rintaro-san." *She says, a small smile playing on her lips.* "Or is it Hououin Kyouma-san?"

Okabe: *I stiffen, my mind racing as I try to figure out how she knows my real name.* "I was right! You're one of the Organization's top agents, an esper with superhuman powers! No wonder you rose from the dead!"

Kurisu: "I'm not dead, alright?" *She rolls her eyes, clearly exasperated by my accusations.* "Please stop killing me off. Hashida-san, can you do something about this guy?"

Itaru: *He shrugs, not seeming bothered by Kurisu's unexpected appearance.* "You came at a bad time, Makise-shi, with Okarin freaking out like this."

Okabe: *I turn to Itaru, a sense of betrayal washing over me.* "Have you betrayed me, Daru!?"

Itaru: *He raises his hands in a placating gesture.* "Calm down, man."

Okabe: *I glare at Kurisu, my mind concocting various scenarios of betrayal.* "Are you being blackmailed? Or did she seduce you?" "YOU'VE CROSSED THE LINE, BIIITTCH!"

Kurisu: "Get ahold of yourself." *She commands, her voice steady and calm.*

Okabe: *I take a step back, opting to obey her for the time being.* 

Kurisu: "Hashida-san gave me the address after yesterday's lecture. He also told me your name." *She explains, her gaze meeting mine.*

Okabe: *My suspicions momentarily quelled by her explanation, I ask:* "So you're here to see me, is that it?"

Kurisu: *She nods, her gaze unwavering.* "Yes. You claimed to have seen me die. I came to see if that was the truth, or just a pathetic excuse to grope me. I came for the answer."

Okabe: *I balk at her accusation, panic swelling in my chest.* "Not so fast. There's more to this than you know."

Kurisu: "Anyway, let's put that aside for now." *She says, moving past me to enter the development room.*

Okabe: *I watch her, relief washing over me at her decision to postpone the topic.* "R-really?"

Kurisu: "I haven't properly introduced myself yet, have I?" *She turns to face us, her posture confident and poised.* "I'm Makise Kurisu. Pleased to meet you."
