Kurisu: "You can't even shake hands? Are all Japanese men this difficult?" *She extends her hand, a small frown on her face.*

Okabe: *I step back, eyeing her hand suspiciously.* "You're not Japanese!?"

Kurisu: "I've lived in America for seven years. What about it?" *She drops her hand, her eyes hardening.*

Okabe: "America..." *I take another step back, my eyes darting to her hand.* "I can feel your aura of malice. You must be a powerful kung-fu master."

Kurisu: "Don't be ridiculous." *She crosses her arms, her gaze turning icy.*

Okabe: "Then you're a NINJA--" *My words are cut off by her harsh glare.*

Kurisu: "Give it a rest." *She turns away, her attention shifting to the gelatinous banana.*

Okabe: "If you grew up in America, shouldn't you say 'HAHAHA! NICE TO MEET YOU!' with a smile across your whole face when asking for a handshake? No, wait, you should be asking for a hug, right?" *I mimic a hug in the air, my eyes wild.*

Kurisu: "What kind of stereotype is that?" *She sighs, turning her attention back to the gelatinous banana.*

Kurisu: "...Fascinating." *She leans in closer, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.* "Have any forceps?"

Okabe: "No!" *I exclaim, quickly stepping between her and the banana.*

Kurisu: "Oh." *She shrugs and then, much to my horror, stabs the gelatinous banana with her index finger.*

Okabe: "What are you doing!? That's precious data!" *I cry out, my eyes wide with shock.*

Kurisu: "It's squishy." *She pulls her finger back, examining the gel clinging to her skin before popping it into her mouth.* "...No taste. Gross."

Okabe: "You have quite the appetite, I see. A side-effect of the resurrection, perhaps? If you're that hungry, I guess I could give you a banana or two!" *I offer her a fresh banana from the bunch.*

Kurisu: "No thanks." *She dismisses my offer, her gaze back on the gelatinous banana.*

Itaru: "Either way, those bananas are Mayushii's." *He pipes up from the corner, his eyes never leaving his computer screen.*

Okabe: "Come, don't be shy. This is an offering. Take it!" *I insist, waving the banana in her direction.*

Kurisu: "As if. Who would eat some perv's banana?" *She rebukes, her gaze finally leaving the gelatinous banana to meet mine.*

Itaru: "A perv's banana...!" *He chokes, his hands shaking.* "Um, can you say that one more time? With a more humiliated expression, if you please."

Kurisu: "Huh?" *She turns to look at him, a perplexed expression on her face.*

Okabe: "Muhaha! Oh, Daru. You may be a worthless, disgusting perv, but let me say, well done, sir!" *I pat him on the back, a wide grin on my face.* "So, Makise Kurisu. You just imagined something, didn't you? By all means, tell us what. Don't be shy. Muhahaha!"

Kurisu: "Why you..." *She clenches her fists, her face turning a bright red.*
