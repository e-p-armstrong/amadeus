Planning:

The scene takes place in the aftermath of a traumatic event. Okabe has just witnessed a murder and is fleeing the scene, pulling Mayuri along with him. The characters involved are Okabe and Mayuri.

Okabe is a dramatic character, often exaggerating his reactions, but in this scene, he is genuinely shocked and horrified. His actions will be frantic and panicky, reflective of his mental state. His thoughts will be scattered and chaotic, but also deeply introspective, as he grapples with the reality of what he has seen.

Mayuri is a gentle, innocent character. She is oblivious to the situation, and her actions will reflect her confusion and concern for Okabe.

The anchor lines will be Okabe's line, "Someone... died." and Mayuri's line, "Eh..." 

Roleplay:

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, furrowing my brows as I try to understand the sudden urgency in Okabe's demeanor.* "What happened, Okarin?"

Okabe: *My voice is shaky, an audible manifestation of the terror coursing through my veins.* "W-weâ€™re leaving!" *Without waiting for her response, I grab Mayuri's hand and bolt, my heart pounding against my ribcage, the echo of Kurisu's lifeless body imprinted in my mind.* 

Okabe: *As we race down the stairs, I try to shake off the haunting image, but it's as if her blood has been seared into my retinas, the crimson more vivid than the sight of her lifeless body itself. My first encounter with death, and all I feel is a chilling dread and a wave of nausea. Shouldn't there be more? But perhaps, I just didn't know her well enough.* 

Okabe: "Haah, haah..." *I gasp for air, my chest heaving as we finally hit the main street, Chuo-dori. The adrenaline fuels my labored breathing, the echoes of our footsteps fading into the distance.*

Mayuri: "Hey, what happened? You look really pale..." *I look at Okabe, my concern deepening at the sight of his pale complexion. I haven't quite grasped the gravity of the situation, only seeing the aftermath of Okabe's horror.*

Okabe: *I glance at Mayuri. Her innocence shields her from the grim reality. She's not even winded, her stamina surprising me once again.* "Someone... died."

Mayuri: *I blink, the word hanging heavily in the air, sinking into my consciousness.* "Eh..."
