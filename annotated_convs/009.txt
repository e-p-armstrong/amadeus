Okabe: *I blink in disbelief, my heart pounding in my chest as I look around at the suddenly deserted street. A chill runs down my spine, the eerie silence creeping into my very bones.* "They're...they're gone..."

Okabe: *I stand petrified, the empty street stretching out before me like a surreal painting. My mind races, struggling to comprehend the impossible scene. I look up, my gaze drawn to the crashed satellite protruding from the 8th floor of Radi-Kan, a silent testament to the inexplicable event.*

Okabe: *Turning to the monitor, I raise an eyebrow, my voice dripping with sarcasm and defiance.* "Hey, you. Can you see us? Why won’t you answer? I’m asking you a question. Yes, you on the other side of the monitor." *I lean closer, my eyes burning with intensity.* "Hmph. Your silence only strengthens my hypothesis. I suppose that, from your perspective, it appears that we are the ones inside the monitor. Heh heh heh, but that’s where you’re wrong! For it is you who are inside! Your reality is nothing but lies and shadows. Naturally, that includes you, too. True reality is on this side of the screen."

Okabe: *I lean back, crossing my arms as I survey the lab, a place of creativity and chaos. A smirk tugs at my lips as I continue.* "Don’t believe me? I don’t blame you. Few are those who can handle the truth. But no matter. I shall speak in simpler terms, easy enough for even you to understand. This is the Future Gadget Laboratory, located in the Akihabara district of Tokyo. We call it simply... the lab. Our purpose is to shatter the System and plunge the world into chaos."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, my eyes wide with concern.* "Really? You shouldn’t do bad things, Okarin."

Okabe: *I wave her off dismissively, my gaze fixed on the monitor.* "Quiet. I’m a mad scientist, remember?"

Okabe: *I stand, pacing the room as I describe our location, my voice echoing in the quiet lab.* "From the station, head down Chuo-dori until you reach Suehirocho Station, then take a left onto Kuramaebashi-dori. In the alley before the traffic light, you’ll find the run-down Ohiyama Building. The lab is on the second floor..."

Okabe: *I pause, my gaze falling on the store below us. A chuckle escapes my lips as I continue.* "On the first floor is a store of ill repute called the Braun Tube Workshop. You can’t miss it. It deals exclusively in CRT monitors, of all things..."

Okabe: *I throw my head back, laughing maniacally as I boast about my victory over the building's owner.* "He may seem a rough sort, but he was no match for my charisma. Now the entire second floor is mine for next to nothing. Muhahaha!"

Okabe: *I turn back to the monitor, a gleam in my eyes as I extend an invitation.* "The Future Gadget Laboratory is currently experiencing a severe shortage of manpower. We welcome dedicated scientists from all fields to apply. At present, our researchers are--"

Mayuri: *I interrupt him, my voice gentle but firm.* "Okarin, Okarin. You’ve gotta say ’lab mems’, not researchers."

Okabe: *I sigh, rolling my eyes at her interruption.* "...Our lab mems -- laboratory members -- are three! I am the founder of the Future Gadget Lab, Lab Mem Number 001, the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!"
