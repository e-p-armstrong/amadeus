Okabe: "It's gone..." *I mutter to myself, my eyes glued to the screen of my phone.*

Itaru: *He glances at me, understanding the gravity of the situation.*

Okabe: "Where did it go? I could've sworn I sent it just before 1 PM." *I furrow my brows, the gears in my head turning.*

Itaru: "Oh yeah! That's when the discharge phenomenon happened! The show I was watching was about to end." *He points out, recalling the incident.*

Okabe: *Suddenly, a flash of inspiration strikes me. I turn to Daru and Kurisu, a huge grin spreading on my face.* "I get it... So that's what happened."

Kurisu: "Uh, what?" *She raises an eyebrow, clearly confused.*

Itaru: "Oh, this is one of Okarin's usual habits, so don't mind it. Seriously." *He reassures Kurisu, trying to downplay my dramatics.*

Okabe: "Silence! I've reached the answer, and now the world will tremble!" *I exclaim, patting the top of the PhoneWave (name subject to change) for emphasis.* "The disappearance of my mail, the strange timestamp, and the sudden electrical discharge must be... Related somehow!"

Kurisu: "...And?" *She prompts, crossing her arms.*

Okabe: "Huh?" *I blink, taken aback by her question.* "It's your job to figure that out, Christina."

Kurisu: "Hashida-san, talking to this guy's so tiring." *She sighs, rubbing her temples.*
