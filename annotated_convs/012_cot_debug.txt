Planning:
The characters involved in this scene are Mayuri and Okabe. 

Mayuri is a cheerful, naive, and slightly air-headed girl who often fails to understand the serious implications of certain situations. Her *actions* and *thoughts* will reflect her lighthearted nature and her tendency to take things lightly. She often uses her catchphrase "Tutturu♪" when she's in a good mood or trying to lighten the mood.

Okabe is an eccentric, dramatic, and passionate young man who often gets caught up in his own world of scientific theories and fantasies. He's usually theatrical in his actions, with grand gestures and exaggerated expressions. However, in this scene, he is genuinely confused and scared, so his *actions* and *thoughts* will reflect his panic and distress.

The anchor lines will be Okabe's "You saw nothing? Nothing at all!? There were people here a second ago, weren’t there!?" and "What the hell is that satellite doing there?" These lines are crucial to the narrative, and their dramatic enhancement will center around Okabe's confusion and fear at the inexplicable situation.

Roleplay:
Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my brow furrowed in confusion, my voice filled with concern.* "What’s wrong?"

Okabe: *I snap back to reality, feeling the solid weight of my surroundings. I look at Mayuri, her innocence a stark contrast to the chaos in my mind.* "E-everyone disappeared just now, right!?"

Mayuri: *I blink in surprise, not comprehending his panic.* "Huh?"

Okabe: *I plead with her, desperation seeping into my voice.* "You saw it too, right!? Just now, before our very eyes!"

Okabe: *Panic grips me and I can't help but grab Mayuri by her slender shoulders, shaking her lightly, hoping she'd understand the gravity of the situation.* "Did you see it, Mayuri!? You saw it, right!?"

Mayuri: *My head bobs back and forth from his shaking, a bewildered expression on my face.* "Hmmm? Huhhhhh?"

Mayuri: *I manage to stammer out in between his frantic shakes.* "IIIII diiiiidn’t seeeee anythiiiiing!"

Okabe: *I stop shaking her abruptly, my hands still gripping her shoulders as I stare deep into her eyes, searching for a glimmer of understanding.* "You... didn’t?"

Okabe: *Disbelief washes over me as I press further.* "You saw nothing? Nothing at all!? There were people here a second ago, weren’t there!?"

Mayuri: *I blink, a look of genuine confusion on my face.* "...There were?"

Okabe: *Frustration builds up as I try to make sense of the impossible.* "Even the store employees are gone! That’s impossible by any measure!"

Mayuri: *I respond, my voice filled with innocent certainty.* "Of course they are..."

Okabe: *I pause, her reply making no sense to me.* "It was like this when we got here. Oh, I know! You’re seeing things, aren’t you? I’m sure it’s ’cause of the heat! Tutturu♪"

Okabe: *I stare at Mayuri, her laughter echoing around the empty space. I feel a sinking feeling of dread. With a heavy sigh, I lift my gaze to the bright blue sky, the stark contrast of the serene sky to the chaos below making me feel even more lost. My eyes drift to the top floor of Radi-Kan, where I had been just a moment before, a chilling reminder of the bloodied body I had found.* "...What the hell is that satellite doing there?"

Okabe: *I continue, my voice barely a whisper as I try to piece together the puzzle.* "Mayuri, about that satellite..."

Mayuri: *I nod, my usual cheerfulness returning as I try to lighten the mood.* "Yup. What a surprise, huh?"
