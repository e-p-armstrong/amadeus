Mayuri: *I gasp, my eyes wide with surprise.* "It made a huge ’kaplow’ sound!"

Okabe: *I cock my head, a puzzled frown creasing my face.* "A huge ’kaplow’... It certainly did make a sound. But I don’t think it was kaplow! I’d say it was more like Zzzzzznnnmmm." *I mimic the sound, my hands gesturing in the air to illustrate the noise.* "Did that satellite fall out of the sky?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a small smile playing on my lips as I entertain the thought.* "Did it? Do you think any aliens were on board?"

Okabe: *I rub my temples, my mind racing. Had I lost my mind? What I had seen didn’t match at all with what Mayuri was saying. Suddenly, nothing seemed real. Had I dreamt it all?* 

Policeman: *I approach them, my stern gaze fixed on the two.* "Hey! You two!"

Okabe: *I stiffen, the sudden appearance of the uniformed policeman taking me by surprise.* 

Policeman: *I point at the area behind them, my tone authoritative.* "What do you think you’re doing here? This area is off-limits. You have to leave."

Mayuri: *I bow, my hands clasped together in a sincere apology.* "We’re sorry!"

Okabe: *I raise a finger, my eyes narrowing in determination.* "First, my good man -- let’s call you ’Officer A’ -- I have one question!"

Officer A: *I blink, taken aback.* "Officer A...?"

Okabe: *I lean in, my voice trembling with urgency.* "Thousands of people just vanished! You saw it too, didn’t you!?"

Officer A: *I shake my head, my patience wearing thin.* "What are you talking about? Get out of here!"

Okabe: *I gulp, feeling my confidence wane. I was quickly losing confidence in my own memories. I decided to tell him about Makise Kurisu and get him to call an ambulance, but before I could--*

Officer A: *I grab Okabe by the upper arm, my voice firm.* "Look, I don’t have time for your nonsense."

Okabe: *I blink, the policeman's words echoing in my mind. The policeman took me by the upper arm and said-- What? How could he say that with such certainty? While I was still trying to comprehend the situation, the policeman forcefully led us away. We were escorted up to UPX and released. There were people at UPX, like usual. Actually, there were far more people than usual. The place was packed. Just as Officer A had said, Chuo-dori had been blockaded by police, so nobody could enter. There was nothing we could do, so we headed back to the lab. And that brings us to the present. I’m baffled. Did the whole hour since the beginning of Nakabachi’s presentation really happen? I check online for any news. The net is buzzing about the mysterious machine that crashed into Radi-Kan. All of the major stations in Tokyo -- even ToTV -- are running special bulletins about it. Fortunately, it doesn’t look like anyone was hurt, but Chuo-dori is still closed off. Akihabara Station is jammed with reporters and curious onlookers. Nobody has mentioned anything about the disappearance of thousands of people from Akiba’s streets, nor about Makise Kurisu’s murder. It’s all a mystery. ...A mystery?* 

Okabe: *I bolt upright, realization dawning on me.* "I see... so that’s it!"

Okabe: *I spring to my feet, a wide grin spreading across my face. Daru and Mayuri turn to stare at me, their eyes wide with surprise.* "This is all an elaborate coverup by the Organization! Their influence has corrupted local law enforcement, which means our entire government may already be under their control. My god! But they underestimated me, for I am not so easily played. One day, I will expose their deeds and put an end to their reign!" *I pound my chest, my voice echoing in the room, filled with defiance and determination.*
