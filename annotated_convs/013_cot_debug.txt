Mayuri: *Notices Kurisu and offers a friendly bow.* "I'm Mayushii. Nice to meet you!"

Kurisu: "I'm Makise. Apparently, I'm a lab mem now." *She says, looking around the lab with curiosity.*

Mayuri: "Really? That's great! Another girl lab mem!" *Her eyes light up with excitement.*

Okabe: *Turns to Itaru, pointing at the old computer.* "Daru, what were you doing with the X68000?"

Itaru: "Like I said, I was adjusting the incoming mail settings..." *He begins to explain, gesturing towards the computer monitor.*

Okabe: *I suddenly interrupt, turning to Mayuri.* "Mayuri! Insert the Juicy Chicken Number One into the PhoneWave (name subject to change)!"

Mayuri: "You all want some? I can give you one each." *She asks cheerfully, placing the chicken inside the microwave.*

Okabe: *I nod at Itaru, then begin typing instructions into the computer.* "I enter 120# on the keyboard and strike the enter key..." *The microwave starts up, and I watch as the chicken begins to spin backwards.*

Kurisu: *She observes the process, leaning in to get a better look at the PhoneWave (name subject to change)*

Okabe: "So, we've reproduced the conditions that existed when the discharge phenomenon occurred. Right?" *I ask, looking over at Itaru.*

Itaru: "Uhh, how was it again..." *He scratches his head, looking a bit confused.*

Okabe: "You there. Assistant!" *I turn to Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "Huh? Me?" *She looks taken aback.* "When did I become your assistant!?"

Okabe: *Ignoring her protests, I quickly instruct her.* "Just send something to my phone!"

Kurisu: *She grumbles under her breath, clearly irritated.* "I don't even know your email address."

Okabe: "What a useless assistant." 

Kurisu: "Don't call me your assistant!" *She retorts, crossing her arms.*

Okabe: *I roll my eyes and turn to Itaru.* "Daru, send an email from your phone!"

Itaru: "Uh, sure... but what?" *He asks, pulling out his phone.*

Okabe: "Send 'Christina's a perv'!"

Kurisu: "I thought we agreed to stop saying that!" *She exclaims, glaring at me.*

Itaru: "Well, let's compromise and go with 'Okarin's a perv'." *He suggests, grinning at Kurisu.*

Okabe: "You traitor!" *I shout, feeling betrayed.*

Kurisu: "Good job, Hashida-san!" *She gives Itaru a thumbs up, smirking at me.*

Mayuri: "Oh no! Mayushii's bananas!" *She suddenly exclaims, holding up a bunch of gel-like bananas.*

Kurisu: "We experimented on them." *She explains, looking a bit apologetic.*

Mayuri: "But they were Mayushii's..." *She looks disappointed, holding the bananas sadly.*

Itaru: "Want me to send the mail now?" *He asks, ready to press send.*

Kurisu: "You'll be reimbursed later. By Hououin-san, that is." *She says, looking at me.*

Okabe: "Why me!?" *I exclaim, feeling cornered.*

Mayuri: "Geez! Why do you always have to experiment on Mayushii's food? Ah! Don't tell me you're experimenting on the chicken too?" *She asks, looking horrified.*

Okabe: "We are." *I confess, trying to look apologetic.*

Itaru: "'Kay, sending it now. Sending, sending, click." *He says, pressing send on his phone.*

Mayuri: *Without thinking, she reaches for the microwave door.* "Huh?" 

Okabe: "Wait! Don't open that!" *I shout, but it's too late.*

Mayuri: "Wawah!" *She jumps back as the microwave sparks and smokes.*

Kurisu: "An electrical discharge!" *She exclaims, stepping back.*

Okabe: *I quickly pull Mayuri away from the smoking microwave.* "E-everyone okay?"

Itaru: "S-somehow." *He coughs, waving away the smoke.*

Kurisu: "That was definitely more than two seconds." *She comments, coughing slightly.*
