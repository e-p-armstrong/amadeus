Okabe: *I carefully release Mayuri from my protective hold.* "Whew. Well, that was something." *I wipe the sweat from my brow with a shaky hand, looking around at the aftermath of our experiment.*

Kurisu: "H-hey! Look at this!" *She stammers, pointing at the center of the room with a trembling hand.*

Itaru: "What the hell? How did that... Yeah, it's a microwave, but it's not heavy enough to make a hole in the floor..." *He scratches his head, staring at the microwave embedded in the floor in disbelief.*

Kurisu: "This can't be caused by electrical discharge. Some other phenomenon?" *She muses aloud, her brows furrowed in deep thought.*

Okabe: *I shake off my surprise and let out a manic laugh.* "Heh... heh heh heh... MUHAHAHA! Just as my calculations predicted!" *I reach for my phone to make my usual proclamation, but stop when I realize it's still connected to the PhoneWave (name subject to change).* "El Psy Kongroo." *I whisper the words to myself, a calming ritual.*

Itaru: "...So, about Mayu-shi's chicken." *He turns to Mayuri with an apologetic look.*

Mayuri: "Eh?" *She looks at him, confusion apparent on her face, before prying open the door of the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to find her chicken burnt black.* "Ahh! M-Mayushii's chicken is all burnt black..."

Okabe: *I pat Mayuri's shoulders in an attempt to console her.* "Juicy Chicken Number One made a noble sacrifice for the progress of science. Let us pray for his happiness in the next life."

Kurisu: "The chicken doesn't matter! Right now, we need to determine what happened with the Phonewa--" *She tries to redirect the conversation, only to be cut off by Mayuri.*

Mayuri: "It doesn't matter? That's so mean, uh, Christina-chan..." *She pouts at Kurisu, her voice small.*

Kurisu: "Hey, Hououin Kyouma! Do something about this! Mayushii-san learned my name wrong!" *She turns to me, frustration clear on her face.*
