Plan:
The characters in this scene are Okabe, Itaru and Mayuri, with Okabe being the main character and narrator. Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, and his *actions* will reflect his dramatic and eccentric nature. Itaru, also known as Daru, is a hacktivist and is more laid-back and practical, his *actions* will reflect this. Mayuri is a kind and cheerful character, but she doesn't have a major role in this scene. The scene takes place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, a cramped and hot room that acts as a development room for their inventions. The focus of the conversation is a microwave that serves as one of their 'gadgets'. The main anchor line is Okabe's last line, where he brings the conversation back to their invention, indicating the importance of their work despite the casual banter. The thematic direction will revolve around the contrast between Okabe's dramatic vision and Itaru's pragmatic approach.

Roleplay:
Okabe: *I raise the can of soda to the light, admiring its effervescence.* "Ah, elixir intellectualis, a drink fit for a genius!"

Itaru: *I roll my eyes at Okabe's theatrics, taking a sip from my own can of soda.* "Cola’s better."

Mayuri: *I giggle, shaking my head as I watch the two of them.* "Okarin really loves his Dr P!"

Okabe: *I point the can at Itaru, a playful challenge in my eyes.* "I pity the man who knows not the greatness of this beverage! Muhahaha!"

Okabe: *I step through the curtain that separates our humble lab, leading the way into the heart of our operations.* The development room is a testament to our ambition, a space dedicated to the creation of Future Gadgets. Sure, it's not much to look at, but it's not about the money. It's about the vision. *I beckon Itaru to follow me into the room, our sanctuary from the world outside. I pick up my lab coat from the chair, slipping it on with a sense of purpose. It's more than just a piece of clothing, it's a symbol of our mission.* 

Okabe: *I turn to Itaru, my tone serious despite the heat of the room.* "Daru. Is the plan progressing smoothly?"

Itaru: *I squint at Okabe, his dramatics lost on me.* "Uh, what plan?"

Okabe: *I sigh, gesturing towards the large microwave sitting on the table.* "The plan, as in the plan. Obviously, I’m talking about perfecting Gadget No. 8."

Itaru: *I shrug, not quite following his train of thought.* "Oh, that. How was I supposed to know what you meant?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, a wry smile playing on my lips.* "We’ve known each other for what, three years now?"

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, correcting him in a matter-of-fact tone.* "We were in different classes junior year, and actually we didn’t talk at all. So two years?"

Okabe: *I wave his correction away, focusing on the bigger picture.* "Details. The point is we’ve known each other a long time. I expect you to keep up with me here."

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, giving him a flat look.* "N O P E"

Okabe: *The silence hangs heavy in the air, the playful banter giving way to a more serious tone. I turn my gaze back to our project, the microwave that held so much potential.* "So, are we any closer to figuring out what’s wrong with Gadget No. 8?" *The question hangs in the air, a reminder of our shared purpose and the work yet to be done.*
