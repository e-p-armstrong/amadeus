Itaru: *I squint at Mayuri, an eyebrow raised in skepticism.* "That’s been bugging me, Mayu-shi. Can you stop calling them ’gelbanas’?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, my eyebrows furrowed in confusion.* "But gelbanas are gelbanas."

Okabe: *Ignoring their banter, I reach over and take the bananas from Mayuri, the whole bunch clutched in my hand. With a swift, determined motion, I stick them into the PhoneWave (name subject to change).*

Mayuri: *I watch him with a pout, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Why do you have to use the whole bunch? It’s a waste of food."

Okabe: *I spin around to face her, pointing an accusing finger in her direction.* "Your stinginess could cost us the battle with the Organization!"

Mayuri: *I drop my gaze to the floor, my voice barely above a whisper.* "That’s fine with me. Mayushii always buys the bananas, and now Mayushii can’t eat a single one."

Okabe: *I give her a dismissive wave, turning my attention back to the machine.* "Next time, we’ll only do one banana." *I can already feel her hungry complaints gnawing at the back of my mind, but I choose to ignore them. I need to focus on the task at hand.*

Guidance: "Hello. This is the PhoneWave (name subject to change)."

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest as the familiar voice of Mayushii Guidance, the system Daru programmed, fills the room.*

Mayuri: *I perk up, a hopeful look in my eyes.* "Do you hear Mayushii’s voice?"

Okabe: *I hush her with a stern glare, my finger pressed to my lips.* "Be quiet. I’m trying to listen."

Guidance: "You can operate the timer from this menu. After pushing the # button, please enter the heating time in seconds. For example, press ’#60’ for one minute. For two minutes, press ’#120’."

Okabe: *As the voice drones on, I focus on the task at hand, my fingers hovering over the buttons. I ignore the proper instructions and enter 120#. A low hum fills the room as the PhoneWave (name subject to change) comes to life.*

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, my arms crossed over my chest.* "Won’t this just warm it normally?"

Okabe: *My heart stops. He's right. I messed up. I quickly shut off the machine, my cheeks burning in embarrassment.* *Taking a deep breath, I try again. This time, I ignore the guidance and enter 120#. The machine hums back to life, and I can't help but smile in satisfaction.*

Itaru: *I look over at the machine, a smirk playing on my lips.* "Nice turntable, right? It’s even spinning backwards."

Okabe: *My eyes widen, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Backwards!?" *I can't believe I never noticed that before. This could change everything.*

Okabe: *I start pacing around the room, my mind racing with possibilities.* "That might have serious implications! If we look at quantum critical behavior driven by Hund’s rule--"

Itaru: *I roll my eyes, cutting him off with a wave of my hand.* "Yeah! No."

Okabe: *I stop in my tracks, my jaw dropping in shock.* "...not Hund’s Rule?"

Itaru: *I smirk, shaking my head.* "No."

Okabe: *I sigh, deflated.* "...okay." *I can't help but feel a pang of disappointment. But there's no time for that now. We wait in silence, our eyes glued to the spinning bananas.*

Mayuri: *I gingerly take the bananas out of the microwave, a smile spreading across my face.* "Gelbanas are ready!"
