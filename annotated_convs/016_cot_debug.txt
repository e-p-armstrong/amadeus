Planning:

The characters involved are Itaru (Daru), Okabe, and Mayuri. 

Itaru is the typical otaku, with a love for all things nerdy and a slightly perverse sense of humor. His *actions* and *thoughts* should be filled with reluctance, humor, and a laid-back energy. 

Okabe is eccentric and theatrical, often getting carried away in his own thoughts and ideas. His lines should be filled with dramatic flair, sudden realizations, and a playful arrogance. 

Mayuri is naive and innocent, often not fully grasping the situation. Her lines should be filled with confusion, innocence, and a sweet, gentle nature.

Anchors: 
1. Okabe's realization about the function of the microwave. The theme is revelation and excitement. 
2. Mayuri's innocent suggestion about the opposite of freezing. The theme is naivety and simplicity. 

Roleplay:

Itaru: *I squint at the gelbanas, my nose wrinkling in distaste.* "...They look really nasty."

Okabe: *I thrust the plate towards Daru, my voice echoing dramatically around the lab.* "The taste doesn’t matter. What matters is that you eat it! So come on, Daru, no need to be shy. Break a leg, or a stomach, and go for it!"

Itaru: *I shake my head, holding my hands up in surrender.* "No way."

Okabe: *I turn to Mayuri, presenting the gelbanas to her with an exaggerated bow.* "...Fine. Mayuri! The honor shall be yours."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, my fingers poking at the gloopy fruit.* "But gelbanas are all gloopy, droopy, soft, and squishy."

Okabe: *My eyebrows lift in surprise.* Wait, she already tried one? "It had no flavor and wasn’t tasty at all..."

Okabe: *I rub my chin thoughtfully, looking between Daru and the gelbanas.* "Gloopy, droopy, soft and squishy... Daru, what do you think?"

Itaru: *I blush, my eyes glinting with a hint of mischief.* "Soft and squishy bananas, huh... Soft and squishy... banana... Mayu-shi, say ’your banana’s all soft and squishy’ for me."

Mayuri: *I point at Daru, my eyes wide with concern.* "Daru-kun, your nose is bleeding."

Itaru: *I wipe at my nose, pleading with Mayuri.* "Please just say it!"

Mayuri: *I open my mouth to speak, my brows furrowing in confusion.* "Your banana’s all soft and--"

Okabe: *I toss a tissue box at Daru, my face reddening with irritation.* "Don’t make her say that, you perv!" *I watch as Daru retreats, rubbing his head where the box hit. Mayuri just smiles innocently, not getting the joke. Anyway.*

Okabe: *I pace back and forth in front of the microwave, my fingers tapping rhythmically against my chin.* "They’re gelatinous, a semi-solid state of matter. In other words, there is a possibility that the intermolecular bonds were weakened." *I pause, my mind racing as I try to figure out what could have partially liquified the bananas...*

Okabe: *I snap my fingers, a triumphant grin spreading across my face.* "I’ve got it!" *I rush to the whiteboard, scribbling the word FREEZING in the center before crossing it out with a dramatic flourish.* "What we thought was a freezing function is actually something else!" *I turn to face the others, my chest puffing out with pride. So why isn’t anyone surprised?*

Okabe: *I gesture to the others, encouraging them to react.* "Now’s the time to shout, ’W-what you say!?’ Come on, don’t be shy!" *Their reactions are pathetically weak. Mayuri probably didn’t even understand half of what I said...*

Itaru: *I shrug, a smirk playing at the corner of my lips.* "Uh, we already knew that."

Okabe: *I deflate, my triumphant grin replaced with a look of surprise.* ...Oh.

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, my fingers drumming against the table.* "The problem is we don’t know what it is doing, or why it’s doing it."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a thoughtful expression on my face.* "If it’s the opposite of freezing, then couldn’t it be thawing them?"

Okabe: *I laugh, shaking my head at Mayuri's innocent suggestion.* "What a silly question, Mayuri. What you’re describing is just a normal microwave!"

Mayuri: *I pout slightly, looking up at Okabe with wide, questioning eyes.* "Then, what is it?"

Itaru: *I sigh, running a hand through my hair.* "We don’t know, and that’s the problem."
