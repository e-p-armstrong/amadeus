Okabe: *I turn to face Daru, my brows furrowing in concern.* "Daru, aren’t you going to check out Radi-Kan?"

Itaru: *I shrug, my eyes still glued to the screen of my phone.* "No point. Can’t get close. I’ve been following the news online, though. There’s already a hundred threads about it on @channel. It’s huge, man."

Okabe: *As we step into the elevator, I remember the sight of Daru engrossed in his phone earlier.* *I press the button for the 5th floor, my mind mulling over Daru's words.*

Itaru: *I stretch out, welcoming the cool air.* "Man, feel that AC! I’m alive!"

Okabe: *I lean against the elevator wall, crossing my arms as I muse over the recent developments.* "About the PhoneWave (name subject to change). I might have found our answer."

Itaru: *I roll my eyes at Okabe's eccentricity.* "You know, that ’(name subject to change)’ thing is really annoying."

Okabe: *I clench my fist, my eyes blazing with determination.* "I won’t give in that easily. Even if no other lab members use ’(name subject to change)’, I will carry on until the day we decide its true name. Now’s not the time."

Itaru: *I chuckle, shaking my head at Okabe's stubbornness.* "So, what’s your latest ridiculous theory?"

Okabe: *I straighten my posture, my voice echoing through the small space of the elevator.* "What do you mean, ridiculous? My genius brain considers every possibility, even those a lesser mind would say break the laws of nature. Don’t you dare call that ridiculous."

Itaru: *I sigh, leaning back against the elevator wall.* "So basically, you’re just pulling stuff outta your ass. You can’t call that science."

Okabe: *I point a finger at Daru, a spark of excitement in my eyes.* "Daru. I have a hunch that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) may be the key to opening Steins Gate. How’s that?"

Itaru: *I rub my temples, trying to keep up with Okabe's wild theories.* "Steins what? You lost me back at ’ridiculous’, man."

Okabe: *As the elevator doors slide open, I step out, only to bump into someone.* "Ah!"

Kurisu: *I stumble, but a hand grabs my shoulder, preventing me from falling.* "I’m sorry!"

Okabe: *I freeze, my grip on her shoulder tightening as I recognize her.* "Wha...!? You... you...!"

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest, a chill running down my spine. I stare at the girl I saw dead just three hours ago.* "Impossible. Makise Kurisu!"

Kurisu: *I frown, trying to pull away from his grip.* "Is there something wrong?"

Okabe: *I don't let go of her shoulder, my grip tightening even more. I can't believe what I'm seeing.* "Y-you... You should be dead! Why are you here!? And you’re even..."

Okabe: *I look her over, searching for any signs of injury, but find nothing.* "Not a scratch..."

Kurisu: *I finally manage to push him away, shooting him a wary glare.* "Hey, that hurts! Let me go!"

Okabe: *I blink, my mind racing to make sense of the situation.* "You’re okay? But that’s impossible! Someone stabbed you! I saw you lying in a pool of blood!"

Itaru: *I sigh, shaking my head at Okabe's delusions.* "That again?"

Okabe: *I turn to Daru, a sense of unease settling in.* "What do you mean, ’again’?"

Kurisu: *I rub my shoulder, my gaze flickering between the two men.* "What’s wrong with you?"
