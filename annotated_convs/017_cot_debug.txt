Kurisu: "Hey. When did I become your assistant?" *She questions, her hands on her hips as she watches me.*

Okabe: *I ignore her query, turning my attention back to my phone.* "Why are you glaring at me?" *I snap back without looking at her.*

Kurisu: "Oh, so you're just raging?" *She crosses her arms defensively.* "Don't glare at me."

Okabe: "You've glared at me before, haven't you?" *I meet her gaze, my eyebrows raised in challenge.*

Kurisu: "That's because you keep doing pervy-- Ah, no, I'm not saying anything." *She quickly cuts herself off, shaking her head.*

Okabe: *I'm so frustrated with these emails, I feel like smashing my phone.* "Are the emails you're getting really that unpleasant?" *I mutter under my breath.*

Kurisu: "They're more... unreasonable than unpleasant." *She leans in, trying to take a peek at my screen.*

Okabe: *I quickly put my phone away and turn to face her.* "So, Christina, what brings you here?"

Kurisu: "If you're going to call me names, could you at least be consistent?" *She counters, her brow furrowed.* "Anyway, my business here doesn't concern you."

Okabe: "Why are you pouting?" *I tilt my head, a smirk playing on my lips.*

Kurisu: "I'm not pouting. I just don't want to get involved in your silly games again." *She retorts sharply, her arms crossed.*

Okabe: "Nonsense. You're already a lab mem. You have a duty to work for the benefit of the lab!" *I declare, waving my hand in a grand gesture.*

Kurisu: "...I regret losing myself to curiosity back then." *She sighs, looking up at the satellite.*

Okabe: "Did you come to see the satellite?" *I follow her gaze, looking up at the alien object.*

Kurisu: "...I guess. It doesn't make sense. Normally, they calculate satellites' orbits so that they burn up in the atmosphere when they fall. So how can that thing be in such perfect condition?" *She muses, her eyes narrowed in thought.*

Okabe: "Where's this satellite from, anyway?" *I ask, genuinely curious.*

Kurisu: "They still don't know. Rumors say it's from the former Soviet Union, but Russia denies it. So it looks like they can't remove it yet." *She explains, shrugging slightly.*

Okabe: "So it's another Organization cover-up! They knew I'd be at Radi-Kan and tried to erase me!" *My eyes widen in realization.*

Kurisu: "Organization? What's that?" *She asks, her expression a mix of confusion and curiosity.*

Okabe: "The Organization is the Organization. Its formal name is something else, but all those who know of its existence call it the Organization out of fear. They rule the world from the shadows, transcending nations, with politics, economics, religion, even science in their clutches." *I explain, my voice dropping to a dramatic whisper.*

Kurisu: "That's obviously a crackpot conspiracy theory, thank you very mu--" *She starts to retort, but suddenly blushes and looks away.* "N-nothing! Really, nothing, okay? Say another word and I hit you!"

Okabe: "A-anyway! What's happened with the PhoneWave!?" *I change the subject, throwing her a smirk.*

Kurisu: "Just answer me. Have you learned anything?" *She demands impatiently.*

Okabe: "No progress. We've tried repeating the experiment, but at present, we haven't been able to reproduce the discharge phenomenon or send another email to the past." *I admit, my expression solemn.*

Kurisu: "I see..." *She murmurs, her gaze thoughtful as she processes the information.*
