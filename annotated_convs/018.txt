Okabe: *I wave my hand dismissively, laughing off the idea.* "I sent you an email? Don’t be ridiculous! I saw her dead just three hours ago!"

Kurisu: *Crossing my arms over my chest, I glare at Okabe.* "Hey! Could you not talk about me like that? I’m perfectly fine."

Itaru: *I scratch the back of my head, deep in thought.* "You know, that message was kinda weird. It was dated a week after I got it, which means it came from the future."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow at Daru, skeptical.* "It came from the future?"

Okabe: *I scoff at Daru's theory, shaking my head in disbelief.* "That sounds like something you’d read on the internet, Daru. It’s rare for you to talk about ridiculous theories."

Itaru: *Pulling out my phone, I show Okabe the email.* "No, the date was definitely a week later. It came from, uh... the 28th. Wait. That’s today!"

Okabe: *I take the phone from Daru, my eyes scanning the email. The content is familiar, but the format isn't. I scratch my head in confusion.* "This is the email I sent you three hours ago."

Kurisu: *Peering over Okabe's shoulder, I study the screen of Daru’s phone.* "Interesting..."

Okabe: *Suddenly aware of Kurisu's presence, I turn to face her. My hand reaches out, almost on its own, to touch her hair. It feels real, tangible.* "Substance. She has substance. Of course she’s not a ghost. How silly of me."

Itaru: *Seeing Okabe's behavior, I feel a wave of second-hand embarrassment.* "O-Okarin, I don’t think that’s a good idea..."

Okabe: *Ignoring Daru's warning, I poke Kurisu’s cheeks with my fingers, marveling at their softness.* 

Kurisu: *Feeling Okabe's touch on my face, I snap.* "...Hey."

Okabe: *Suddenly recalling our earlier physical contact, I feel a wave of confusion. My hand moves to the hem of her blouse, intending to check for wounds.* 

Kurisu: *Slapping Okabe's hand away, I glare at him, my anger bubbling to the surface.* "Are you trying to get yourself arrested?"

Okabe: *Unfazed by Kurisu's outburst, I meet her gaze defiantly.* "I just want to know the truth."

Kurisu: *Feeling Okabe's hand on my blouse, I slap him, my patience finally snapping.* "What truth, you perv!? You stupid!? Wanna die!?"
