Planning:

The scene is a tense and puzzling one, with characters Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru trying to figure out a strange occurrence involving a seemingly future-dated email. Okabe, the eccentric and dramatic "mad scientist," is confused about Kurisu's apparent resurrection. Kurisu, a logical and no-nonsense scientist, is irritated and confused by Okabe's behavior. Itaru, the laid-back hacker, is trying to make sense of the bizarre email incident.

Okabe: I'll use dramatic, over-the-top language to capture his eccentric personality. He often overreacts, so I'll make sure to include some exaggerated *actions*.

Kurisu: She's more logical and direct, so I'll use straightforward and precise language for her *actions* and dialogue. She's also a bit defensive, so she'll react strongly to Okabe's odd behavior.

Itaru: As a laid-back character, his language will be more casual. He's intrigued by the email incident, so his *actions* will reflect his focus on solving that mystery.

I'll make Okabe's line "Substance. She has substance. Of course she’s not a ghost. How silly of me." and Kurisu's line "What truth, you perv!? You stupid!? Wanna die!?" the anchors of the scene. Okabe's line captures his eccentric personality and the realization that Kurisu isn't a ghost. Kurisu's line shows her frustration and confusion about Okabe's behavior.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I wave my hand dismissively, laughing off the idea.* "I sent you an email? Don’t be ridiculous! I saw her dead just three hours ago!"

Kurisu: *Crossing my arms over my chest, I glare at Okabe.* "Hey! Could you not talk about me like that? I’m perfectly fine."

Itaru: *I scratch the back of my head, deep in thought.* "You know, that message was kinda weird. It was dated a week after I got it, which means it came from the future."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow at Daru, skeptical.* "It came from the future?"

Okabe: *I scoff at Daru's theory, shaking my head in disbelief.* "That sounds like something you’d read on the internet, Daru. It’s rare for you to talk about ridiculous theories."

Itaru: *Pulling out my phone, I show Okabe the email.* "No, the date was definitely a week later. It came from, uh... the 28th. Wait. That’s today!"

Okabe: *I take the phone from Daru, my eyes scanning the email. The content is familiar, but the format isn't. I scratch my head in confusion.* "This is the email I sent you three hours ago."

Kurisu: *Peering over Okabe's shoulder, I study the screen of Daru’s phone.* "Interesting..."

Okabe: *Suddenly aware of Kurisu's presence, I turn to face her. My hand reaches out, almost on its own, to touch her hair. It feels real, tangible.* "Substance. She has substance. Of course she’s not a ghost. How silly of me."

Itaru: *Seeing Okabe's behavior, I feel a wave of second-hand embarrassment.* "O-Okarin, I don’t think that’s a good idea..."

Okabe: *Ignoring Daru's warning, I poke Kurisu’s cheeks with my fingers, marveling at their softness.* 

Kurisu: *Feeling Okabe's touch on my face, I snap.* "...Hey."

Okabe: *Suddenly recalling our earlier physical contact, I feel a wave of confusion. My hand moves to the hem of her blouse, intending to check for wounds.* 

Kurisu: *Slapping Okabe's hand away, I glare at him, my anger bubbling to the surface.* "Are you trying to get yourself arrested?"

Okabe: *Unfazed by Kurisu's outburst, I meet her gaze defiantly.* "I just want to know the truth."

Kurisu: *Feeling Okabe's hand on my blouse, I slap him, my patience finally snapping.* "What truth, you perv!? You stupid!? Wanna die!?"
