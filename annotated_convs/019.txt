Itaru: *I throw my head back, grinning as I celebrate my victory in the virtual world.* "Louise-chan’s famous line for the win!"

Okabe: *Ignoring Daru's antics, I focus my intense gaze on Kurisu, my voice trembling with the weight of what I witnessed.* "I know what I saw!"

Kurisu: *I gasp, my eyes going wide with shock as I quickly pull down my blouse.* "No way! Did you just see my underw...!?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, frustration building.* "No, you fool! Not that!"

Okabe: *Pausing, I take a deep breath, recalling the horrific scene I stumbled upon earlier this afternoon. The image of Kurisu, lifeless and bathed in her own blood, haunts me as I recount the events to her, my voice barely above a whisper.* 

Kurisu: *My eyes narrow in confusion, my mind trying to piece together his words.* "Wait. Doctor Nakabachi?"

Itaru: *I frown, interrupting Okabe's story.* "What are you talking about, Okarin? Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation was canceled."

Okabe: *I blink in disbelief.* "Canceled!?"

Itaru: *I nod, matter-of-factly.* "Yeah. Because of the satellite crash."

Okabe: *A cold sense of dread washes over me. Our stories aren’t matching, just like when I saw the mass disappearance. I can't help but wonder if I am caught in some sinister plot or if this is another Organization conspiracy.*

Kurisu: *I clear my throat, trying to break the tense silence.* "Excuse me, um..."

Okabe: *I straighten up, a manic grin spreading across my face.* "My name... is Hououin Kyouma!"

Itaru: *I sigh, shaking my head in exasperation.* "Really, man? You’re hopeless..."

Kurisu: *I nod, trying to keep my composure.* "Okay, Hououin-san. I’d like to hear your story in more detail."

Okabe: *Relief washes over me as I realize she believes me. But my relief quickly turns to confusion as I struggle to understand why my memories don’t match everyone else’s. As I grapple with my thoughts, an older man steps out of the assembly hall.*

Professor: *I glance at my watch, then at Kurisu.* "Makise-san? It’s almost time."

Kurisu: *I blink, surprised.* "Huh? Oh, right. Thank you."

Kurisu: *I glance back at Okabe, a hint of uncertainty in my eyes, before sighing and heading towards the small conference room.*

Itaru: *I shrug, getting up from my seat.* "We should go too."

Okabe: *I look at him, confused.* "Go where?"

Itaru: *I roll my eyes.* "To hear the lecture, duh?"

Okabe: *As Daru follows after Kurisu, a realization hits me. Did she come to attend the lecture too? It feels strange. Why would the girl genius, Makise Kurisu, need to attend a lecture like this? My guess was a bit off. She didn’t come to attend the lecture.*

Kurisu: *I clear my throat, my hands clasping the podium tightly.* "Um, I’d like to thank everyone for coming to hear me speak today."

Okabe: *My eyes widen in realization.* "She’s the one giving the lecture..."

Okabe: *The pieces finally fall into place. Japan’s famous girl genius, Makise Kurisu, who had her thesis published at the tender age of 17. According to Daru, she turned 18 a few days ago. I first heard about her when Daru pointed her out in a gossip magazine article. That’s when he told me that she was going to be a guest at ATF. I’d forgotten all about it.*

Kurisu: *I swallow nervously, my eyes scanning the audience.* "It’s my first time giving a lecture like this, so please forgive me if I’m a little nervous."
