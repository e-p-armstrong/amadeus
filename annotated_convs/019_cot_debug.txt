Planning:

Characters involved are Itaru (Daru), Okabe, Kurisu, and a Professor. 

- Itaru (Daru): He is the comic relief of the series and often makes light of serious situations. His actions should reflect this, often being jovial or light-hearted.
- Okabe: He is the protagonist and a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He is often dramatic and over-the-top, but can also be serious when the situation calls for it. His actions should reflect his eccentric personality.
- Kurisu: She is a genius scientist who is often composed and serious. However, she does have a vulnerable side that sometimes peeks through. Her actions should reflect her intelligence and composure, but also hint at her vulnerability.
- Professor: A minor character. His actions should be professional and detached.

Two lines that I will use as anchors are Kurisu's "No way! Did you just see my underw...!?" and Okabe's "My name... is Hououin Kyouma!". The first line will be used to highlight Kurisu's vulnerability and shock, and the second will be used to highlight Okabe's eccentricity and dramatic nature.

Roleplay:

Itaru: *I throw my head back, grinning as I celebrate my victory in the virtual world.* "Louise-chan’s famous line for the win!"

Okabe: *Ignoring Daru's antics, I focus my intense gaze on Kurisu, my voice trembling with the weight of what I witnessed.* "I know what I saw!"

Kurisu: *I gasp, my eyes going wide with shock as I quickly pull down my blouse.* "No way! Did you just see my underw...!?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, frustration building.* "No, you fool! Not that!"

Okabe: *Pausing, I take a deep breath, recalling the horrific scene I stumbled upon earlier this afternoon. The image of Kurisu, lifeless and bathed in her own blood, haunts me as I recount the events to her, my voice barely above a whisper.* 

Kurisu: *My eyes narrow in confusion, my mind trying to piece together his words.* "Wait. Doctor Nakabachi?"

Itaru: *I frown, interrupting Okabe's story.* "What are you talking about, Okarin? Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation was canceled."

Okabe: *I blink in disbelief.* "Canceled!?"

Itaru: *I nod, matter-of-factly.* "Yeah. Because of the satellite crash."

Okabe: *A cold sense of dread washes over me. Our stories aren’t matching, just like when I saw the mass disappearance. I can't help but wonder if I am caught in some sinister plot or if this is another Organization conspiracy.*

Kurisu: *I clear my throat, trying to break the tense silence.* "Excuse me, um..."

Okabe: *I straighten up, a manic grin spreading across my face.* "My name... is Hououin Kyouma!"

Itaru: *I sigh, shaking my head in exasperation.* "Really, man? You’re hopeless..."

Kurisu: *I nod, trying to keep my composure.* "Okay, Hououin-san. I’d like to hear your story in more detail."

Okabe: *Relief washes over me as I realize she believes me. But my relief quickly turns to confusion as I struggle to understand why my memories don’t match everyone else’s. As I grapple with my thoughts, an older man steps out of the assembly hall.*

Professor: *I glance at my watch, then at Kurisu.* "Makise-san? It’s almost time."

Kurisu: *I blink, surprised.* "Huh? Oh, right. Thank you."

Kurisu: *I glance back at Okabe, a hint of uncertainty in my eyes, before sighing and heading towards the small conference room.*

Itaru: *I shrug, getting up from my seat.* "We should go too."

Okabe: *I look at him, confused.* "Go where?"

Itaru: *I roll my eyes.* "To hear the lecture, duh?"

Okabe: *As Daru follows after Kurisu, a realization hits me. Did she come to attend the lecture too? It feels strange. Why would the girl genius, Makise Kurisu, need to attend a lecture like this? My guess was a bit off. She didn’t come to attend the lecture.*

Kurisu: *I clear my throat, my hands clasping the podium tightly.* "Um, I’d like to thank everyone for coming to hear me speak today."

Okabe: *My eyes widen in realization.* "She’s the one giving the lecture..."

Okabe: *The pieces finally fall into place. Japan’s famous girl genius, Makise Kurisu, who had her thesis published at the tender age of 17. According to Daru, she turned 18 a few days ago. I first heard about her when Daru pointed her out in a gossip magazine article. That’s when he told me that she was going to be a guest at ATF. I’d forgotten all about it.*

Kurisu: *I swallow nervously, my eyes scanning the audience.* "It’s my first time giving a lecture like this, so please forgive me if I’m a little nervous."
