Kurisu: "That presentation was canceled because of the satellite crash." *She crosses her arms, a skeptical look on her face.*

Okabe: "So it seems." *I nod, scratching my chin thoughtfully.* "But in my hallucination, the presentation proceeded as planned. Mayuri and I went to see it, and you came over to flirt with me."

Kurisu: "I don't flirt. Especially not with idiots like you." *She retorts, rolling her eyes.*

Okabe: "Like I said, it wasn't real, okay? No... maybe this world is what isn't real. That would explain the riddle of the PhoneWave (name subject to change). If this world is some kind of simulation, then we can disregard the laws of physics." *I say, staring off into the distance.*

Kurisu: "Escapism? That's unexpectedly chicken of you." *She snorts, clearly not impressed.*

Okabe: "It's a hypothesis. Your favorite thing." *I counter, smirking.*

Kurisu: "So who stabbed me? Don't tell me it was you." *She narrows her eyes, studying my reaction.*

Okabe: *I shiver, the memory of her lifeless body flooding back.* "You were already dead when I got there. I didn't see who did it."

Kurisu: "I don't get it. Why do I have to die in your mind? You have something against me?" *She demands, her tone rising in frustration.*

Okabe: "Of course not. At that point in time, we had only spoken once. We were just strangers." *I defend, raising my hands in a placating gesture.*

Okabe: "Anyway, we didn't know each other. That's why I ran away instead of calling for an ambulance." *I add, looking away guiltily.*

Kurisu: "My hero." *She says sarcastically, folding her arms.*

Okabe: "What? You want me to go back in time and give you CPR or something? I'd need to use the PhoneWave (name subject to change) for that." *I quip, trying to lighten the mood.*

Kurisu: "...I've heard enough. No more hallucinating about me, okay? Dying isn't fun, even if it's in someone else's head." *She warns, pointing a finger at me.*

Okabe: "I can't make any guarantees. That would require perfect 24-hour surveillance inside my brain." *I shrug, grinning.*

Kurisu: "You have a comeback for everything, don't you." *She sighs, shaking her head.*

Okabe: *As she turns to leave, I reach out and grab her shoulder.* "Kyah! What now!?"

Okabe: "I'm not done talking!" *I declare, holding onto her arm.*

Kurisu: "You trying to pick a fight?" *She snaps, trying to pull away.*

Okabe: "It's revenge for ruining my farewell scene, Christina! You shall regret your thoughtless actions!" *I say, letting go of her arm dramatically.*

Kurisu: "Okay, okay, fine. What is it?" *She asks, rubbing her shoulder where I grabbed it.*

Okabe: "About the IBN 5100." *I say, watching her closely for a reaction.*

Kurisu: "I don't know what you're talking about." *She shrugs, looking confused.*

Okabe: "...If you don't know, then forget about it. Farewell! We will not meet again." *I turn to leave, confident that I have the upper hand.*

Kurisu: "Hey! Don't tell me to forget about it!" *She grabs my arm, stopping me in my tracks.*

Okabe: "The IBN 5100. It's a retro PC from 1975. I'm looking for one." *I explain, looking back at her.*

Kurisu: "Yeah? What are you going to do with it?" *She asks, her interest piqued.*

Okabe: "Interested?" *I tease, and she quickly averts her eyes.*

Okabe: "You're interested, aren't you?" *I persist, grinning at her discomfort.*

Kurisu: "...Just a little." *She mutters, still avoiding my gaze.*

Okabe: "Then I shall answer! The IBN 5100 is the key to unlocking SERN's most closely guarded secrets." *I proclaim, striking a dramatic pose.*

Kurisu: "SERN? You mean... the SERN?" *She asks, her eyes widening.*

Okabe: "Indeed. Through the tireless efforts of my faithful lab mems, we have uncovered evidence that SERN is researching time travel." *I announce, puffing out my chest proudly.*

Kurisu: "...Great. I shouldn't have asked." *She groans, rubbing her temples.*
