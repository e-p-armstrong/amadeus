Okabe: *I squint my eyes, studying Kurisu's features. She seems slightly on edge. Was it just the anticipation of her presentation, or something more?* "Was it just me, or did Kurisu look a little nervous just now?"

Kurisu: *I step forward, my hands clasping the edges of the podium. I take a deep breath, steeling myself for the question I'm about to pose.* "Let’s say we wanted to make a machine that could physically transport people through time. What would we need? The best candidates for this are cosmic strings and wormholes. A cosmic string is a string-shaped ’crevice’ with extreme mass."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow at Kurisu's explanation. Cosmic strings? A crevice to another universe? These theories, were they really plausible?* "A string-shaped crevice? That must be how they enter our universe. But do cosmic strings really exist?"

Kurisu: *I continue, my voice steady and sure, explaining the complexity of cosmic strings. My hands move as if painting a picture of the universe, the cosmic strings, and the immense power they hold.* "The crevice is about as wide as an elementary particle, and at least as long as the diameter of a galaxy. It has immense mass, so it distorts space-time. If you were to travel through that distortion, you could make a full circle around the string in less than 360 degrees. In short, you can do something resembling a warp. This is called a space-time angular deficit. When you pass through an area of angular deficit, transit time becomes zero. Now we apply this to a cosmic string moving at near-light speed. According to the special theory of relativity, time will flow slower for the cosmic string in relation to its surroundings. Therefore, passing through the area of angular deficit would cause the transit time to become negative instead of zero. In other words, you will arrive in the past after transit. If you use two cosmic strings, you can do a space deficit jump. If you loop back to your original location, you can return to the same time you started revolving. And that, roughly speaking, is time travel by means of cosmic strings. By the way, just so nobody misunderstands, cosmic strings are not the same as superstrings. Now then, you need three things in order to travel to the past with cosmic strings. First. The cosmic strings themselves. Two strings, to be exact. By the way, they are hypothesized to exist only where the universe was first formed, so they might be a little hard to find. Second. You would need the energy required to make them move them at near-light speed. How much energy do you think you’d need to accelerate something as long as the Milky Way to near the speed of light? I’m pretty sure it’s a little more than 1. 21 jigowatts."

Okabe: *I glance around, taking in the amused expressions on the audience's faces. Kurisu had managed to turn this complex lecture into something entertaining.* "This earns a few chuckles from the audience."

Kurisu: *I pause, letting the laughter die down before continuing.* "Third. You’d need a spaceship capable of reaching these cosmic strings and returning. With the time traveler alive, of course. What do you think, Hououin-san? Care to take on the challenge of cosmic string time travel?"

Okabe: *I blink, caught off guard by Kurisu's direct challenge. Why was she singling me out?* "Like that’s even possible. And why the hell is she addressing me? I wasn’t even the one who jeered this time."

Kurisu: *I tilt my head slightly, a small smirk playing on my lips.* "Hm? Looks like Hououin-san doesn’t want to take the challenge. In that case, let’s consider wormholes. They may be a little more realistic than cosmic strings. By the way, Hououin-san. Do you know what wormholes are?"

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, feeling the weight of her question. I didn't want to engage, but it seemed I had no choice.* "No, don’t ask me! I’m trying to hold back here. Since I’ve been challenged, though, I can’t leave the question unanswered."

Okabe: *I straighten my back, meeting Kurisu's gaze. I might not be a genius scientist like her, but I wasn't completely clueless.* "It’s like a shortcut through space... right?"
