Kurisu: *I take a deep breath, my fingers tracing an imaginary tunnel in the air before me.* "If you stabilize the tunnel with exotic matter injection, instantaneous travel between wormholes becomes possible. To travel through time, however, takes a little more effort." *I pause, ensuring my audience is following.* "For example, let’s say there’s a wormhole entrance here in Akihabara, and the exit is in Los Angeles. First, we send the wormhole in LA all the way to the end of the universe at near the speed of light. And once it’s there, we yank it back to LA."

Okabe: *I frown, trying to piece together the puzzle of her words.* "Uh... how?"

Kurisu: *I offer a small smile, my fingers continuing their dance in the air.* "According to the special theory of relativity, time slows down for objects moving at the speed of light. Meaning the hole that returned to LA would be further in the past than the Akihabara hole. So now, if Hououin-san jumped into the wormhole, he’d arrive in LA several years before he left. However, this still can’t be called true time travel. It only seems that way. This is called the Urashima effect." *I glance at Okabe, gauging his reaction.* "The important part is to return to Akihabara from LA through the wormhole once more. Since the transit time is zero... Hououin-san will return to Akihabara several years in the past. Time travel complete." *I fold my arms, a clear indication that I am not done yet.* "The prerequisites for wormhole travel are simpler than the ones for cosmic string travel. First. The wormhole itself. They may exist somewhere in the universe. But nobody has ever seen one. Second. The energy required to move a wormhole to the end of the universe and back at near-light speed. Third. Exotic matter, which, by the way, has not been confirmed to exist."

Okabe: *I lean back, my mind whirling with the sheer impossibility of it all.* "So, implementation of either one would require a ridiculous amount of effort."

Kurisu: *I nod, my eyes dark and serious.* "Now do you see what I meant when I said that time travel is an absurd concept? Time travel theories are all just thought experiments. Not one of them can create a viable time machine. That is my answer."

Student: *I raise my hand, hoping for an easier solution.* "Isn’t there anything simpler? Like something you can pull out of a drawer and just use, or something."

Kurisu: *I shake my head, a wry smile playing on my lips.* "I’m afraid not."

Okabe: *I watch her, noting the firmness in her voice, the finality of her declaration.*

Kurisu: *I look around the room, my gaze landing on Okabe.* "This is the limit of modern physics. I can’t say how it might change in ten years, though. Besides, even if someone did overcome the logistical requirements, there may be other factors that prevent time travel from working. And that’s because fundamental problems concerning the principle of causality have not yet been solved."

Okabe: *I clench my fists, a sudden realization hitting me.* "You mean time paradoxes... and conservation of mass?"

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, impressed by his deduction.* "If you think that conservation of mass applies to macro-systems like the universe or micro-systems like atoms or elementary particles, you’re mistaken."

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback.* "What!? Is that true?"

Kurisu: *I chuckle, amused by his reaction.* "Heh."

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, my cheeks burning.* "Ah! She’s laughing at my reaction! That little... Gah, how mortifying..."

Kurisu: *I regain my composure, returning to the lecture.* "Conservation of mass only applies to chemical reactions. It doesn’t hold in modern physics at all. Something can come from nothing."
