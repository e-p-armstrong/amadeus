Kurisu: "Hey. What are you two talking about?" *She interjects, her curiosity piqued by our conversation.*

Luka: "Um... who might this be?" *He asks, his gaze shifting from me to Kurisu.*

Okabe: "My assistant." *I declare, gesturing grandly towards Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "No! What kind of introduction is that!?" *She objects, crossing her arms in annoyance.*

Okabe: "I'm only telling the truth, Christina." *I insist, a smirk on my face.*

Luka: "You're n-not Japanese?" *He asks tentatively, taking a step back.*

Kurisu: "I am Japanese." *She corrects, her tone gentle.*

Okabe: "Anyway, Lukako. I need to talk to your father about--" *I begin, eager to get to the main point.*

Kurisu: "Wait! Introduce me properly!" *She interrupts, her patience clearly fraying.*

Okabe: "You want to be introduced? Properly?" *I question, feigning surprise.*

Kurisu: "It's unnatural not to be introduced in this situation!" *She argues, her hands on her hips.*

Okabe: "I didn't come here to introduce you to Lukako!" *I retort, my tone exasperated.*

Kurisu: "An introduction wouldn't take more than ten seconds! What's wrong with you?" *She demands, her eyes flashing with irritation.*

Luka: "Um... please don't fight..." *He pleads, wringing his hands nervously.*

Okabe: "This is Makise Kurisu. My assistant." *I introduce, gesturing towards her once again.*

Kurisu: "Yeah, whatever. Assistant, whatever... sigh." *She concedes, rolling her eyes.*

Luka: "Nice to meet you, Makise-san. I'm Urushibara L-Luka." *He bows, his cheeks flushing as he introduces himself.*

Kurisu: "Nice to meet you too. How old are you?" *She asks, her tone polite.*

Luka: "17 this year." *He replies, his voice barely above a whisper.*

Kurisu: "A year younger than me..." *She murmurs, her eyebrows raising in surprise.*

Luka: "Oh, really? Makise-san, you're so grown up, I can't believe we're only a year apart." *He compliments, his eyes shining with admiration.*

Okabe: "That means you look old." *I tease, an amused grin on my face.*

Luka: "No, that's not what I... um, I mean you're very beautiful!" *He stammers, his cheeks turning a deeper shade of red.*

Kurisu: "Thanks. I think you're very cute." *She replies warmly, a kind smile on her face.*

Okabe: "You're introduced. Happy? Can we move on now?" *I ask, clapping my hands together in satisfaction.*

Kurisu: "You are such a jerk." *She retorts, shaking her head in disbelief.*

Okabe: "Anyway, Lukako, I require an audience with your father. Can you make it happen?" *I request, my tone serious.*

Luka: "Yes, sure, but why do you need to talk to my dad?" *He asks, his eyes wide with curiosity.*

Okabe: "It's a grave matter that concerns the future of mankind." *I state, my voice filled with gravity.*

Luka: "The future..." *He echoes, his eyes filled with awe.*

Kurisu: "Of mankind?" *She repeats, her eyebrows raised in disbelief.*

Luka: "I'll go get him!" *He exclaims, quickly turning to race into the shrine office.*

Luka’s Father: "Slow down a little. If you rush me, I'm going to fall." *He warns, staggering a bit as he's practically dragged by Luka.*

Luka’s Father: "Ah, Hououin-kun. It's been a while. Thank you for always taking care of Luka." *He greets, his voice filled with warmth.*

Okabe: "The honor is mine." *I reply, bowing respectfully.*

Kurisu: "...His name isn't Hououin. It's Okabe." *She corrects, her tone matter-of-fact.*

Okabe: "You there, assistant! Stop making things complicated!" *I scold, pointing an accusing finger at her.*

Kurisu: "I'm just telling the truth." *She insists, crossing her arms stubbornly.*

Luka’s Father: "Hahaha. It's great that you all get along." *He chuckles, his eyes twinkling with amusement.*

Luka’s Father: "Are you one of Luka's friends too? Please get along with Luka from now on too." *He requests, turning his gaze to Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "Um, I'm..." *She starts, her voice trailing off as she's cut off.*
