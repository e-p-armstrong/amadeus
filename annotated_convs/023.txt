Kurisu: *I adjust my glasses with a stern expression, my eyes scanning the crowd as I prepare to drop a bombshell.* "The time paradox of time paradoxes. In other words, the Grandfather Paradox."

Okabe: *Listening intently, I find myself musing aloud.* "Oh, that thing where you kill your own ancestors before you were born?"

Kurisu: *I nod once, sharply, my eyes flaring with passion.* "As long as this paradox goes unsolved, time travel can never be realized. Never." *My hands clench into fists as I drive the point home.*

Student: *I raise a hand hesitantly, the confusion clear in my voice.* "What if you just don’t kill them?"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, a faint smile playing on my lips.* "You can’t think of it like a sci-fi movie. It’s not just about your family tree. There are far greater dangers than that."

Okabe: *I furrow my brows, deep in thought.* "Really? It doesn’t seem that dangerous."

Kurisu: *I take a deep breath, readying myself for the next part of my lecture.* "Any paradox, no matter how small, would cause the total collapse of causality, relativity, and every other physical law in existence. Paradoxes are nothing more than thought experiments. They cannot occur in reality, and they should not. Nothing that has even a 0. 000001% chance of causing a paradox can happen. The universe won’t allow it. Wouldn’t you say this is the logical conclusion? There may be loopholes, like parallel worlds or the self-consistency principle, but those seem too much like fantasy for me to accept."

Okabe: *My head spins with the complexity of her explanation, a low groan escaping my lips.* "Gah..."
