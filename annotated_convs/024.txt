Kurisu: "Pathetic. It's only as big as a CRT monitor." *She scoffs, crossing her arms over her chest.*

Okabe: "Then why don't you try carrying it? Then you'll understand." *I challenge, gesturing towards the bulky box.*

Kurisu: *She rolls her eyes at me, then bends down to grab the edges of the box.* "Wheugh...!" *She attempts to lift it, her arms straining with the effort, but it doesn't budge.* "...It's r-really heavy."

Luka: "Umm, there is one, but actually, it's broken... I'm sorry." *He stammers, bowing apologetically when Kurisu asks about a push cart.*

Okabe: "No, we don't need a push cart." *I shake my head, getting an idea.* "It may be too heavy for one person, but it's a different story for two. You and I just need to carry it together. Why else do you think I made you my assistant?"

Kurisu: "So that's why... Well, if we carry it together, we might be able to manage, but... But I refuse." *She steps back, crossing her arms again in defiance.*

Okabe: "...huh?" *I blink at her, surprised.* "I'm pretty sure you said 'but I refuse.'"

Kurisu: "Sh-shut up. I said no." *She turns away, her cheeks flushed.*

Okabe: "I see. Then I guess I have no choice. I'll do my best to carry it, but..." *I glance at Luka, who looks ready to pitch in.*

Luka: "Um, th-then, I will..." *He raises his hand timidly, ready to help.*

Okabe: "No, Lukako. I shouldn't make you help me. I can manage by myself." *I shake my head, not wanting to impose.*

Luka: "But... we're friends, Okabe-san. I want to help you." *He insists, looking determined.*

Okabe: "No, I'll do it myself." *I reply sternly.*

Luka: "I-I'll help you!" *He repeats, not backing down.*

Kurisu: "Th-then, umm... me too..." *She mumbles, looking at the ground.*

Okabe: "Please, go ahead." *I gesture towards the box, grinning.* "Muhahaha! Don't you know, Christina? This is what you call a Japanese Gag!"

Kurisu: "You sneaky..." *She glares at me, but moves to pick up the box again.*

Okabe: "Now, assistant! Since you volunteered, I won't let you refuse. Grab hold and heave!" *I encourage, picking up my end of the box.*

Kurisu: "...Fine." *She grumbles, lifting her end of the box.*

Okabe: "Let's just go." *I start to walk out of the shrine, Kurisu walking backwards to keep up.*

Kurisu: "Hey! Stop stop stop! I said stop!" *She yells, tripping over her own feet.* "Don't walk forwards. Then I have to walk backwards. Let's walk sideways."

Okabe: "Whatever. Get moving, assistant." *I reply, not slowing down.*

Kurisu: "Hey, listen, please, just listen! I can't walk backwards!" *She protests, trying to keep up.*

Okabe: "Of course you can. You're my assistant."

Kurisu: "I appreciate the vote of confidence, but I can't! I'm asking you to go sideways! No, I'm telling you to go sideways! Sideways! I'm going to fall!" *She yells, nearly tripping again.*

Okabe: *After a long and arduous trek, we finally reach the lab.* "Haah, we finally made it... I'm exhausted..." *I let out a sigh of relief, dropping the box on the floor with a thud.*

Kurisu: "Haah, we finally made it... I'm exhausted..." *She echoes, collapsing onto the nearest chair.*
