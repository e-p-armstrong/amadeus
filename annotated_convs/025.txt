Luka: *I bow slightly, my eyes downcast, a blush spreading across my cheeks.* "Thank you."

Okabe: *I shake my head, a small smile playing on my lips as I gaze at Luka's innocent face.* "Such a lovely smile. But he’s a guy."

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes sparkling with excitement.* "Such a beautiful master-disciple relationship. Mayushii’s not a fujoshi, but she’s getting a little excited."

Luka: *My eyes widen in surprise, and I hastily shake my head, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Ehh!? M-Mayuri-chan, please don’t imagine such things..."

Okabe: *I chuckle, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Geez. Though we do have a master-disciple relationship. I, Hououin Kyouma, have gone to great lengths to brainwash -- er, I mean teach -- Lukako about the evil conspiracies that rule the world, and how to resist them. That stuff about Demon Sword Samidare is part of that training. Looks aside, Lukako is very obedient and hardworking. Plus, he’s always eager to learn new things. A master couldn’t ask for a better disciple. Though he does have the weaknesses of not catching on too quickly and being too shy."

Okabe: *I turn my attention to Mayuri, a questioning look on my face.* "What are you doing here, Mayuri?"

Mayuri: *I twirl a lock of my hair around my finger, a dreamy look in my eyes.* "I came to see Luka-kun. ComiMa’s coming up next month, and I want him to cosplay as Kirari-chan from RaiNet. But he won’t say yes..."

Luka: *I fidget with the hem of my robe, my cheeks flushing a deeper shade of red.* "But, cosplaying... that’s just too embarrassing for me..."

Mayuri: *I bounce on the balls of my feet, my voice filled with hope and determination.* "But I’m sure you’ll look great in it! The phrase ’someone this cute can’t be a girl’ is really popular, you know? C’mon, make your cosplay debut!"

Okabe: *I glance at Mayuri, my gaze lingering on her hopeful expression before turning back to Luka.* "Mayuri’s hobby is making costumes. She’s made at least thirty so far, but it’s rare for her to wear one herself. Instead, she seems to get her kicks from seeing other people wear them. And it looks like she’s chosen Lukako as her next target. Naturally, the costume Mayuri is currently raving about is for a female character. Normally, I would understand why a man wouldn’t want to dress like a girl, but come on. Lukako has no problem wearing miko robes. Why should cosplay be any different?  But whatever. I have business to take care of."

Okabe: *I hold up a hand, cutting off Mayuri's enthusiastic chatter.* "Save the trivial stuff for later."

Mayuri: *I pout, my eyes wide with surprise.* "Ehh? But it’s really important to Mayushii."

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, my voice firm and commanding.* "And it’s trivial to me! Anyway, Lukako. There’s a good reason for my being here today. I need you to perform an exorcism."

Luka: *I blink in surprise, my hands clasping together in front of me.* "An exorcism? Then I’ll go get my dad. Please wa--"

Okabe: *I wave my hand dismissively, cutting him off.* "No, it’s nothing that serious. I just need some peace of mind."

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, glancing around the shrine.* "That’s why I came here instead of Kanda Shrine."

Okabe: *I point at Luka, my voice filled with authority.* "So with that said, bring out the usual."

Luka: "Um, the usual? You mean Samidare?"

Okabe: *I throw my hands up in exasperation, my voice rising in disbelief.* "No! Who the hell uses a demon sword for an exorcism!? The usual for an exorcism should be obvious!"

Luka: *I wring my hands together, confusion written all over my face.* "Uhh... um...?"

Okabe: *I rub my temples, struggling to find the right words.* "I don’t know what it’s called, but it’s that stick with the zigzaggy paper thingies that the priest does a shaky thingy with!"

Mayuri: *I burst into laughter, pointing at Okabe.* "Ahaha! That sounded really dumb, Okarin!"
