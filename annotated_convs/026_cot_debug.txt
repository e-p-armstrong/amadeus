Character Analysis and Planning:
- Okabe: A self-proclaimed mad scientist with a flair for the dramatic. His actions and thoughts should reflect his eccentric nature, often grandiose and over-the-top.
- Mayuri: A cheerful, innocent high school girl who is also the childhood friend of Okabe. Her actions should reflect her sweetness and simple happiness.
- Luka: A timid, kind-hearted young man who is often unsure of himself. His actions should mirror his shyness and hesitance.

Anchor Lines:
1. Okabe: "Guh! It’s the evil spirit... in my arm!" - This line can be made more intense and dramatic, emphasizing Okabe's eccentricity.
2. Luka: "O-okay!" - This line can reflect Luka's hesitance and fear, as well as his desire to help Okabe.

Roleplay:

Luka: *With a swift bow, I turn and sprint towards my home, nestled within the shrine grounds, disappearing from sight.*

Mayuri: *I rummage through my bag, my fingers finally closing around the familiar, cool metal of Pockety, my beloved pocket watch. I've had this treasure since elementary school; it's more than a timepiece, it's a piece of me.* "Well, time for me to go to work!"

Okabe: *I nod at her, my hands pocketed nonchalantly.* "Do your best. You going straight home afterwards?"

Mayuri: *I nod, my smile as bright as ever.* "Yup."

Mayuri: *I wave at Okabe, already looking forward to seeing him again.* "See you tomorrow!"

Okabe: *I quickly call out to her before she can disappear from my sight.* "Wait, Mayuri. Back at Radi-Kan, you heard a man scream, right?"

Mayuri: *I pause, blinking in surprise.* "Scream?"

Mayuri: *I touch my temple, trying to remember, then I just shrug and flash him my usual smile.* "When was that again?"

Okabe: "This afternoon."

Mayuri: *I shake my head, my brows furrowing slightly.* "I don’t think I heard anything..."

Okabe: *I sigh, feeling a twinge of disappointment.* "...Oh. Well, alright."

Mayuri: *I giggle at his expression, my eyes twinkling with amusement.* "Okarin’s a weirdo! Bye bye! Tutturu♪" *I finally leave, waving at him enthusiastically before disappearing beyond the archway.*

Luka: *I reappear shortly after Mayuri's departure, clutching the white zigzaggy thing Okabe asked for.* "Thanks for waiting, Okabe-san."

Okabe: *I brush off his concern with a dismissive wave.* "Don’t worry about Mayuri. Begin the exorcism at once, Lukako!"

Luka: *I blink in surprise, my eyes wide with confusion.* "Um, okay, but do you really want me to do it? What exactly am I exorcising, anyway?"

Okabe: *A shiver runs down my spine, followed by a sudden chill.* "Guh! It’s the evil spirit... in my arm!" *I grab my violently shaking wrist, my eyes wide with fear and anticipation.*

Okabe: *I struggle to keep my voice steady, my gaze never leaving my trembling arm.* "Be still, foul spirit! Guh... Hurry, Lukako! It’s trying to take over!"

Luka: *I gasp, my eyes welling up with worry.* "N-no way! Please hang in there, Okabe-san!"

Okabe: *I shake my head, my voice fierce despite the pain.* "I’m not Okabe-san!"

Luka: *I flinch, quickly correcting myself.* "I’m sorry, Kyouma-san! Ahh, but what should I..."

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, trying to fight back the pain.* "The exorcism... hurry! Just do it... like I taught you!"

Luka: *I take a deep breath, trying to steady my shaking hands.* "O-okay!" *I grasp the oonusa as if it were a sword, my stance mirroring Okabe's teachings.*

Luka: *I swallow hard, my mind racing as I try to remember the exorcism ritual.* "Ummm... ummm..."
