Okabe: "Yeah... thanks for the help... you're... a lifesaver... Phew, really... thanks..." *I say panting heavily, laying a hand on Luka's shoulder in gratitude.*

Luka: "Ah, no..." *He blushes, looking down and fiddling with his fingers.*

Okabe: *I notice Lukako starting to fidget.* "Since you're my master, Kyouma-san, I'm happy... to be of use to you." *He doesn't wipe the sweat off his brow but smiles bravely at me.* "So cute... But he's a guy. It's so disappointing!" *I sigh dramatically, then shift my gaze to the second floor, the lights are on.*

Okabe: "Come forth, my servants! By the covenant I command thee, grant me thy power!" *I shout towards the second floor, my voice echoing around us.*

Luka: "K-Kyouma-san!?" *He squeaks, looking at me with wide eyes.*

Kurisu: *The second story window opens suddenly, and a familiar face appears.* "You're so annoying! What is it!?" *She yells, clearly irritated at my theatrics.*

Okabe: "Huh, I summoned an assistant. What are you doing here?" *I pretend to be surprised at her presence, a smug grin spreading across my face.*

Kurisu: "Who're you calling an assistant? You wouldn't pick up your phone, so I've been waiting here an hour for you." *She crosses her arms over her chest, glaring at me from the window.*
