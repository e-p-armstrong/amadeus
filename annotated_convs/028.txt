Tennouji: *I narrow my eyes, studying the girl in front of me with a scrutinizing gaze.* "Are you a student?"

Amane: *I shake my head, meeting his gaze steadily.* "No."

Tennouji: *My brow furrows, trying to decipher her intentions.* "Why do you want to work here?"

Suzuha: *I look around the shop, my eyes lingering on the rows of CRTs, a faint smile playing on my lips.* "Because I love CRTs."

Tennouji: *A grin spreads across my face, her enthusiasm infectious.* "Hired! You start tomorrow!"

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, my mouth dropping open.* "Wait, what? Is this some sort of joke? Are we on camera!?"

Suzuha: *I let out a sigh of relief, my shoulders relaxing.* "Thanks, boss." *Turning to Okabe, I raise an eyebrow in curiosity.* "Um, who are you?"

Okabe: *I straighten up, my eyes gleaming with a mischievous twinkle.* "You... dare ask my name? Banish the thought from your head, girl. To learn it would place your life in jeopardy. Countless women have learned my name only to find themselves targets of the Organization. Sarah in America, Claudia in Italy, Simone in France... I won’t put anyone else in danger."

Tennouji: *I roll my eyes, shaking my head in exasperation.* "Hey, stop pulling things outta yer ass. This idiot rents the second floor. Name’s Okabe Rintaro."

Okabe: *I gasp in mock indignation, clutching my chest.* "My name is not Okabe. It’s Hououin--"

Tennouji: *I glare at him, my voice stern.* "Quit it, or I raise your rent."

Okabe: *I deflate, the theatrics fading.* "...I’m Okabe Rintaro."

Suzuha: *I stand up, placing my hand on his shoulder, my gaze serious.* "I don’t know anything about this Organization that’s after you. But if you’re ever in trouble, Okabe Rintaro, let me know. I can help with stuff like that."

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, not expecting such a sincere offer.* "...Huh?"

Tennouji: *I raise an eyebrow, equally surprised.* "...?"

Suzuha: *I meet his gaze again, my expression calm.* "If necessary, I can hurt them so bad they’ll never bother you again."

Okabe: *I step back, a chill running down my spine.* "Mister Braun, I don’t think you should hire her."

Tennouji: *I nod, pondering his words.* "Yeah. She might be a wild one. I’ll fire her if she causes any trouble. Anyway, ignore that Organization nonsense. It’s all in Okabe’s head."

Suzuha: *I tilt my head, my brow furrowing in confusion.* "It is?"

Okabe: *I smirk, my eyes twinkling with mischief.* "You just keep thinking that."

Suzuha: *I nod, a determined look in my eyes.* "So that’s the current trend. Thanks for the tip!"

Okabe: *I wipe my forehead, the heat of the day catching up with me.* "...so hot."
