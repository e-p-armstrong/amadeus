Okabe: "Yanabayashi Shrine." *I state, gesturing towards the sacred location.*

Suzuha: "Yanbayashi Shrine? You mean, like a Shinto shrine?" *She asks, her brows furrowing in confusion.*

Okabe: "Yeah." *I confirm, nodding.*

Suzuha: "What was it doing there..." *She trails off, her gaze distant as if trying to recall something.*

Mayuri: "Oh! So that's why Luka-kun's with you." *She exclaims, her eyes lighting up in realization.*

Luka: "Y-yeah..." *He stammers, nervously fidgeting with the hem of his shirt.*

Kurisu: "What's this? What're you talking about?" *She asks, her gaze shifting between us, trying to piece together the conversation.*

Luka: "Um, the IBN... two thousand... five thousand... what was it?" *He asks, scratching his head in confusion.*

Okabe: "I got an IBN 5100." *I declare, triumphantly holding up the bulky piece of machinery.*

Kurisu: "Oh, that thing you were talking about yesterday." *She says, her eyes narrowing slightly as she analyzes the equipment.*

Suzuha: "Ah...!" *She gasps, her eyes widening as she spots Kurisu. She approaches her slowly, her gaze intense.*

Kurisu: "Y-yes?" *She stammers, taken aback by the sudden attention.*

Suzuha: "Makise Kurisu?" *She asks, her voice barely above a whisper.*

Kurisu: "Yes...?" *She replies, her expression guarded as she meets Suzuha's gaze.*

Kurisu: "What is it? Have I done something to you?" *She questions, her tone defensive.*

Suzuha: "...Hmph." *She grunts, turning on her heel and walking away without a word.*

Kurisu: "Who was that?" *She asks, her brows furrowed in confusion.*

Mayuri: "Oh, she works part-time at the Braun Tube Workshop. Her name's Suzu-san!" *She happily supplies, oblivious to the tension.*

Okabe: "I know." *I respond, frowning slightly at Suzuha's abrupt departure.*

Mayuri: "You do?" *She asks, her eyes wide with surprise.*

Kurisu: "Why was she glaring at me like that?" *She wonders aloud, her arms crossing over her chest defensively.*

Okabe: "How should I know? Did you do something to make her angry?" *I ask, raising an eyebrow in her direction.*

Kurisu: "I've never seen her before in my life. How rude." *She huffs, clearly unimpressed by the encounter.*

Okabe: "Anyway, help me out here. We're taking this thing into the lab." *I instruct, gesturing towards the IBN 5100.*

Okabe: "Hey! Why didn't you help!?" *I shout at Daru, who's lazily munching on chips by his computer.*

Itaru: "Well, you didn't call me." *He shrugs, not looking up from his screen.*

Okabe: "I said all members assemble, didn't I!?" *I retort, throwing my hands up in exasperation.*

Okabe: "Good work, you three." *I commend, handing each one a banana as a token of my gratitude.*

Okabe: "This is my thanks for helping. Eat up." *I say, watching them take the bananas with satisfied smiles.*

Okabe: "That reminds me, Mayuri. It's thanks to you that I got this IBN 5100. If it weren't for your information, it would've taken forever to find it." *I say, giving her a grateful nod.*

Kurisu: "What are you going to use the IBN 5100 for? Yesterday you said something about SERN." *She asks, her eyes never leaving the machine.*

Okabe: "You interested, Christina?" *I tease, grinning at her obvious curiosity.*

Kurisu: "I'm not Christina, and I'm not interested. If you don't want to tell me, then I don't really care." *She retorts, crossing her arms over her chest.*

Okabe: "This artifact is needed for the war against SERN." *I reveal, my tone ominous.*

Kurisu: "War? SERN's a research institution." *She responds, her brows furrowing in confusion.*

Okabe: "Ostensibly, yes." *I reply, nodding slowly.*

Kurisu: "...What are you trying to do? Depending on the situation, I could turn you over to the police, you know?" *She warns, her gaze stern.*

Okabe: "Hmph, the police? Do you really think a mad scientist like me is afraid of the police? I've spent my life on the run from the Organization, a more fearsome enemy than you can possibly imagine." *I scoff, my chest puffing out with pride.*

Kurisu: "You can't be serious. Tell me what you're trying to do." *She insists, her tone firm and unyielding.*
