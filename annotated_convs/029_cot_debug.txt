Itaru: "Wow, it actually turned on. First I need to learn how to use this thing." *He plugs in the old computer, the power supply making a turbulent noise.* "It looks like hooking it up is gonna be a pain. It might take a while. I can't play with this thing and search for the server admin's ID at the same time."

Okabe: "Alright. Prioritize the ID search." *I nod in agreement, looking thoughtfully at the old computer.* "If possible, I'd like you to get the IBN 5100 ready to use this month, though."

Itaru: "There's still 30 days left this month. It's not gonna take that long." *He grins at me, full of confidence.*

Mayuri: "We're gonna take off now, okay?" *She announces, standing up with Luka, both of their empty banana peels in hand.*

Luka: "Um, pardon the intrusion." *He bows slightly, always polite.*

Okabe: "You two did well today. Be proud." *I give them a nod of approval.*

Kurisu: "You're so full of yourself." *She rolls her eyes at me, folding her arms across her chest.*

Mayuri: "Chris-chan, you not going home? You can walk with us to the station if you want."

Kurisu: "Thanks. But I'm going to stay here a little longer." *She shakes her head, her eyes lingering on the machine Daru is working on.*

Mayuri: "Okay. See you later! Tutturuâ™ª" *She waves cheerfully at the rest of us.*

Luka: "Excuse me." *He follows Mayuri out the door, casting a shy glance back at us.*

Kurisu: "Well?" *She turns to me, her brows furrowed in expectation.*

Okabe: "Well, what?" *I raise an eyebrow, playing dumb.*

Kurisu: "I'm asking for an explanation." *She insists, her gaze never leaving mine.* "What's this about the IBN 5100 and SERN? Hey, Okabe."

Okabe: "...What?" *I look up at her, noticing her intense stare.* "What did you just call me?"

Kurisu: "I called you O-Okabe." *She meets my stare defiantly.*

Okabe: "You called me Okabe?" *I take a step towards her, an indignant look on my face.*

Itaru: "Time out, time out!" *He quickly steps in, trying to defuse the situation.*

Okabe: "Did you just call me Okabe?" *I ignore Daru, closing the distance between Kurisu and me.*

Kurisu: "...I did. Problem?" *She holds her ground, looking me straight in the eye.* "Yes, I'm younger than you, but you insist on calling me by ridiculous names like Christina and Zombie, so I don't think I need to show you any respect by adding '-san', and besides--"

Okabe: "That's not the problem!" *I interrupt her, my voice echoing in the room.*

Kurisu: "!!" *She flinches at my outburst, her eyes widen slightly in surprise.*

Okabe: "I am not Okabe! I am HOUOUIN KYOUMA! How many times do I have to tell you, Christina!?" *I insist, my face inches away from hers.*

Kurisu: "...God, you're so full of yourself." *She mutters, breaking eye contact.*

Okabe: "From now on, call me Hououin. That or Kyouma." *I demand, standing my ground.*

Kurisu: "No." *She snaps back at me, wiping away a tear.*

Okabe: "Are you... crying?" *I ask, noticing the glistening trail on her cheek.*

Kurisu: "I'm not crying! It's not like I was scared of you for a second there or anything, and I definitely wasn't relieved when you started talking like an idiot again, okay!?" *She turns away from me, staring out the window.*

Okabe: "Daru, why is my assistant crying?" *I turn to Daru, looking for answers.*

Itaru: "Uh, she said so herself just now." *He shrugs, trying to keep the mood light.*

Okabe: "All I did was correct her on my name." *I defend myself, opening the fridge and pulling out a bottle.*

Itaru: "Maybe she only acts strong but is actually weak on the inside. That would be pretty moe." *He chuckles, going back to his work.*

Okabe: *I toss the bottle to Kurisu once she turns around.* "I'll explain in a second. Drink that while you wait."

Kurisu: "Kya!" *She tries to catch the bottle, but it slips from her grasp and lands on the floor.* "...Gee, thanks." *She picks it up, shooting me a glare.*
