Planning Stage:

The characters involved are Okabe and Itaru. Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist and the protagonist of the series. He has a dramatic and eccentric personality and often uses flowery language and made-up terms. His *actions* will be written to reflect his theatrical nature and his strong sense of purpose. Itaru, on the other hand, is a laid-back, easy-going character who's a hardcore otaku. His *actions* will be written to reflect his relaxed nature and his love for anime and gaming culture. 

The anchor lines in this scene will be Okabe's opening line and his line about having a sensitive matter to discuss. These lines will be written to reflect Okabe's dramatic flair and his tendency to exaggerate the importance of everyday events.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I hold my phone tightly, my voice deep and mysterious.* "It’s me. Report."

Itaru: *I can almost see his eyes rolling on the other end of the line.* "...Okarin, can you drop the act when you’re on the phone at least?"

Okabe: *I ignore his sarcasm, my mind focused on the task at hand.* "Are you aware that John Titor has returned?"

Itaru: *His reply is nonchalant, as if he's more interested in something else.* "I have no idea what you’re talking about."

Okabe: *I adjust my glasses, my mind racing with possibilities.* "Where are you, anyway? You coming to the lab?"

Itaru: *He sounds distracted, probably staring at some anime figurines.* "I’m at MayQueen+Nyan²."

Okabe: *I sigh, shaking my head.* "Again?"

Itaru: *I can't help but think about the maid cafe in Akiba where Daru spends so much of his time. He's a regular there. Apparently, 3D cat maids are his thing too.*

Okabe: *I clear my throat, trying to bring the conversation back on track.* "I have a sensitive matter to discuss."

Itaru: *In truth, it’s not sensitive at all, but I can't help but add a touch of drama to the situation.*

Okabe: *My voice is firm, leaving no room for argument.* "Don’t move until I get there."

Itaru: *His reply is cut off by my abrupt hang up.* "Huh? You’re coming? Fine, bu--"
