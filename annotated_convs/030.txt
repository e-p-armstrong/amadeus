Kurisu: *She takes a swig from her Dr P can* 

Okabe: "Oh? You're a fan of the Doc, I see." *I comment, raising an eyebrow in surprise.*

Kurisu: "I've lived seven years at its birthplace, after all." *She replies, a note of pride in her voice.*

Okabe: "Excellent. We'll make great drinking buddies." *I chuckle, lifting my own can in a mock toast.*

Kurisu: "I'm a minor." *She retorts, her expression unchanging.*

Okabe: "That's not what I meant. I meant Dr P drinking buddies." *I clarify, waving my hand dismissively.*

Kurisu: "Is that all you drink?" *She asks, her eyes narrowing slightly.*

Okabe: *I shrug, mirroring her earlier action.* "Pretty much." *As she takes another sip, I start to explain our recent discoveries about SERN, their operations, and their involvement with the IBN 5100. As I go on, I notice Kurisu's expression growing more intense.*

Kurisu: "SERN certainly is acting strange... but how's the IBN 5100 involved?" *She asks, her brow furrowing as she tries to make sense of it all.*

Okabe: "SERN's database uses an IBN 5100." *I explain, leaning back in my chair.*

Itaru: "It's not super hacka. How many times do I have to tell you?" *He interrupts, rolling his eyes.*

Kurisu: "Is that okay? Won't they catch you?" *She asks, her eyes darting between Itaru and me.*

Itaru: "I wouldn't make a blunder like that." *He boasts, puffing out his chest.*

Kurisu: "That's not what I meant." *She retorts, crossing her arms.*

Okabe: "As a result, we found evidence that those bastards are researching time travel with the LHC." *I continue, ignoring the interruption.*

Kurisu: "The LHC?" *She exclaims, her eyes widening.*

Itaru: "Seriously. We have the evidence. And guess what? The LHC has been in operation for nine years." *He adds, grinning.*

Kurisu: "What? Really!?" *She gasps, her eyes wide with shock.*

Okabe: "And they've successfully generated mini black holes." *I state, leaning forward for emphasis.*

Kurisu: "No way... Then why haven't they made an official announcement!?" *She demands, her face a picture of disbelief.*

Okabe: "That's just it. For some reason, those bastards won't announce any of it. That the LHC has been operating for nine years. That they've successfully created mini black holes. That they're researching time travel. Basically, it's proof that SERN has--" *I'm cut off by the buzzing of my phone.* 

Okabe: *I sigh, frustrated by the interruption.* "Dammit. Another email." *I quickly scan the message, then turn back to Kurisu and Itaru.* "Sorry. Daru, please continue the explanation." *I instruct, turning my attention back to my phone.*

Itaru: "Up to the point where SERN's using IBN 5100 code for their database." *He explains, gesturing with his hands.*

Okabe: "So basically, what that means is-- The only way to decrypt that database is to use an IBN 5100 of our own." *I conclude, locking eyes with Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "How do you know that?" *She asks, her gaze piercing.*

Okabe: "I have my sources." *I reply, my expression unreadable.*

Kurisu: "Setting the IBN 5100 and such aside... I want to see proof that SERN's really doing that sort of research." *She declares, her tone challenging.*
