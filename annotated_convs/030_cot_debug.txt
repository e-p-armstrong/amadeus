Planning:

Okabe: The protagonist, he is eccentric and dramatic. His actions will be exaggerated, filled with intensity and passion. His thoughts will be analytical and calculated, often filled with humor and wit.

Moeka: A shy and introverted character, her actions will be subtle and timid, often reflecting her reluctance to engage in direct conversation.

Itaru: A tech-savvy and casual character, his actions will be relaxed and his thoughts laid back, often filled with humor.

The scene revolves around Okabe trying to send an email to Moeka but accidentally sending it to Itaru. The main themes would be confusion, frustration, and a slight tinge of comedy.

Anchor Lines: 
1. Okabe: "What the hell is this!? Are you mocking me!?"
2. Okabe: "That’s just my alias. I’ll send another one with my true--"

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I feel my face heat up with exasperation, my hands balling into tight fists at my sides.* "What the hell is this!? Are you mocking me!?" *I tower over her, my voice echoing off the surrounding buildings.*

Okabe: *I extend my hand towards her, my fingers twitching impatiently.* "Just hand me your phone! I’ll enter it!"

Moeka: *I can barely make out her response, a soft squeak escaping from her lips. She clutches her phone tighter, refusing to meet my gaze.* "...!"

Okabe: *My frustration mounts as I watch her shake her head, her knuckles turning white as she clings to her phone. I let out a sigh of defeat, resigned to the fact that she won't hand it over.* "Alright, then just give me your address. I'll send you a blank mail." *I fumble with my phone, hastily typing in her name as 'Shining Finger'. I hit send, watching her closely for a reaction.*

Okabe: *My eyes widen as my phone suddenly starts vibrating in my hand.* "Woah!" *I glance at the caller ID, frowning when I see Daru's name.* "It’s me. What is it?"

Itaru: *His voice comes through loud and clear, annoyance seeping through the speaker.* "What do you mean, ’what is it’? I’ve been waiting, you know? And what’s with that blank email?"

Okabe: *Confusion washes over me, my brows furrowing in thought.* "Blank email? It went to you?"

Itaru: "It sure did."

Okabe: *I chuckle nervously, scratching the back of my head.* "That was a mistake. Don’t worry. The email will self-destruct in 10 minutes."

Itaru: *His voice cuts off as I hang up, a smirk playing on my lips.* "Hey, just what are--"

Okabe: *I let out a sigh, quickly dialing Moeka's number once again. I hit send, watching her carefully as she stares at her phone.* "And, send. It should come through any second now." 

Moeka: *She looks up at me, her eyes wide and filled with confusion.* "Okabe... Rintaro?"

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat, my eyes narrowing suspiciously at her.* "What!? How do you know that name!?"

Moeka: *She holds up her phone, a hint of a smile playing on her lips.* "From the blank email..."

Okabe: *My eyes widen in realization, my face flushing with embarrassment.* "That’s just my alias. I’ll send another one with my true--"

Moeka: *She cuts me off with a simple shake of her head, her eyes returning to her phone.* "No... this is fine."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow at her, my lips forming a smirk.* "Nonsense! I am not Okabe Rintaro, but Hououin Kyou--"

Okabe: *I pause, my smirk fading as I realize she's not buying it.* "Did you delete the picture?"
