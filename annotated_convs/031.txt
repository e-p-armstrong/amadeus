Okabe: *I cross my arms over my chest, my gaze hardening as I address Moeka.* "If you deleted it, then prove it."

Moeka: *She silently turns her phone towards me. I scrutinize the screen, and all I see is the picture of that computer. A wave of relief washes over me.*

Moeka: *She taps on her screen a few more times, then looks up at me, her gaze inscrutable.* "I’ll email you... later. So ask... okay?"

Okabe: *I frown, puzzled by her cryptic words.* "About what?"

Moeka: *Her lips part as she hesitates, her eyes momentarily flicking to the side.* "...The urban legend."

Okabe: *I blink in surprise as realization dawns on me. Of course. I almost forgot. She then starts to wander off, her expression as cool and unreadable as ever. I notice that we never once made eye contact throughout our encounter. I try to send her an email, but her phone remains unresponsive. A look of bewilderment crosses her face as she glances at me, a silent question in her eyes. I try to send the email again, but the result remains the same. The entire situation is beginning to annoy me, but Moeka's persistence leaves me with no choice but to keep trying.*

Maids: *I finally escape from Moeka and find myself at the door of the MayQueen+Nyan² maid cafe. As I push open the door, two familiar cat-eared girls greet me with bright smiles.* "Welcome back, Myaster!"

Mayuri: *Mayuri, or rather, Mayushii NyanNyan as she's known here, spots me and her face lights up.* "It’s Okarin!"

Okabe: *I nod at her, feeling a sense of familiarity and comfort in this place. I've been here quite a few times, making me somewhat of a regular customer.*

Mayuri: *She bows at me again, her eyes sparkling with delight.* "Welcome back, Okarin."

Mayuri: *Suddenly, she gasps, as if a light bulb just went off in her head.* "Hey, Okarin! Mayushii just noticed something. ’Welcome back’ and ’Okarin’ go really well together!"

Okabe: *I shake my head, a small smile tugging at the corners of my mouth. Mayuri's innocence can sometimes be refreshing.*

Faris: *Just then, Faris approaches me, her voice filled with excitement.* "Kyouma! It’s great that you came, nya!"
