Kurisu: "...I'll wait until then." *She states firmly, crossing her arms and settling more comfortably into her chair.*

Itaru: "You'll wait? It's already getting dark. Why not go home for tonight and come back tomorrow morning?" *He suggests with a worried glance towards the window.*

Kurisu: "No thanks. I'll wait. I want to know as soon as possible, even if it's just a microsecond sooner." *Determination shines in her eyes, and she leans forward, showing her eagerness.*

Okabe: "Heh heh heh, that's the spirit. You're already fascinated by the conspiracy. You can't help but want to know what lies at the heart of SERN." *I chuckle, clearly enjoying the intrigue.*

Kurisu: "If what you guys are saying is true... then this isn't something to joke about. SERN is the world's top research institution. If they're doing secret experiments without publishing their results... They're making fools of scientists the world over. That's only if it's true, though." *She glances at us pointedly, emphasizing her skepticism.*

Okabe: "Anyway, Daru. I'll leave it to you." *I say, gesturing towards the heavy-looking cardboard box on the floor.*

Itaru: *We grunt as we lift the box together, half dragging it into the development room. Kurisu trails behind us, observing our efforts.*

Kurisu: "Can you show me the PhoneWave?"

Okabe: "Indeed I can. Want to experiment?" *I ask with a wide grin, already excited by the prospect.*

Kurisu: "You haven't been able to send another email to the past yet, right? Do you know why?" *She asks, her gaze focused on the peculiar gadget.*

Okabe: *I can only shake my head, unsure of the answer.*

Kurisu: "Let's run some tests." *She declares, her eyes scanning the cluttered room.*

Kurisu: "Man. You have a ton of junk." *She comments, picking up a strange-looking device from a shelf.*

Okabe: "It's not junk! Since you're new to the Future Gadget Laboratory, I'll explain. These are the glorious fruits of our science: the Future Gadgets! Future Gadgets 1-7 are stored here. The PhoneWave, with which you are already familiar, is Gadget Number 8." *I proudly explain, puffing out my chest.*

Kurisu: "Future Gadgets, huh..." *She muses, inspecting the device in her hands.*

Kurisu: "Hey. Isn't this... a weapon?" *She asks, holding up a device that looks suspiciously like a landmine.*

Okabe: "Future Gadget No. 4: Moad Snake, designed after a claymore landmine, is an instant humidifier." *I explain, trying to stifle my laughter.*

Kurisu: "How confusing." *She mutters, placing the device back onto the shelf.*

Okabe: "Insert water and turn the power on, and in mere seconds, it generates a thick cloud of steam." *I demonstrate, earning a flat look from Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "So it's junk. I thought so." *She sighs, shaking her head.*

Kurisu: "I'm borrowing this." *Without waiting for approval, she snatches up Daru's unused lab coat and puts it on.*

Okabe: "Whoa!" *I exclaim, surprised by her boldness.*

Kurisu: "It's just not right without a lab coat." *She states, adjusting the coat.*

Okabe: *Overwhelmed, I seize her hand.* "Assistant! You get it, don't you!?" 

Kurisu: "G-get what? Let go!" *She pulls her hand away, blushing.*

Okabe: "If you're gonna do science, you need a lab coat! Right!?" *I proclaim, grinning widely.*

Okabe: "I knew you were meant for this, Christina! You're the best assistant a mad scientist could ask for!" *I declare, ignoring her protests.*

Kurisu: "I don't know if that's supposed to be a compliment, but it's coming off as an insult. Now let go!" *She shakes off my hand, turning her back on me.*

Okabe: "I'm giving you that lab coat to commemorate your joining the lab. Don't worry. It's never been worn. Or maybe this fateful encounter between you and that lab coat was decided by destiny long ago. Daru not wearing it was just another inevitability. This is the choice of Steins--" *I begin, but she cuts me off.*

Kurisu: "Shut up so we can start the experiment." *She says, the stern look back on her face.*
