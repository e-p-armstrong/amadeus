Okabe: *I point to the X68000, there's code on the screen.* "It's in terminal mode now. We can change the factory settings like this, make the microwave do things its manufacturer never intended."

Kurisu: "How was it set when the discharge phenomenon occurred?" *She asks, her gaze focused on the strange machine.*

Okabe: "Nothing out of the ordinary. It was at factory settings." *I reply, shrugging.*

Kurisu: "Hmm. I'll take a banana." *She scans the room, her eyes landing on the bunch of bananas.*

Okabe: "Those are Mayuri's." *I warn her, my eyes follow her movements.*

Kurisu: "Oh, so I don't need your permission, then. I'll go buy new bananas tomorrow." *She picks up a banana and walks towards the PhoneWave, squatting down to place it inside.*

Okabe: *I watch as she types something into her phone and pushes send. The PhoneWave starts turning backwards.*

Kurisu: "...Nothing happened." *She admits after the chime rings. The banana is still in the microwave, un-gelified.*

Okabe: *I can't help but smirk as she yelps and quickly draws back her hand.* "Meaning the microwave functioned normally."

Kurisu: "It's hot." *She mutters, blowing on her fingers.*

Okabe: *I cross my arms, deep in thought.* "What does this mean...?"

Kurisu: "I guess what happened earlier was an irregularity after all." *She concludes.*

Okabe: *I shake my head.* "I don't know if it's an irregularity or not, but we ought to investigate the cause."

Kurisu: "I agree." *She nods, her eyes meeting mine.*

Okabe: *I can't help but feel a sense of satisfaction.* "In the previous experiment... After spending 120 seconds in the PhoneWave, the banana teleported back to the bunch gelified. We should consider that it returned to its state 120 seconds before."

Kurisu: "Wrong. If it returned to its state 120 seconds before, it wouldn't be gelified." *She argues, her tone firm.*

Okabe: "The chicken returned to its frozen state without gelifying."

Kurisu: "That logic is dubious. Sure it ended up frozen, but did you examine the possibility that it might have gelified first?" *She raises a valid point.*

Okabe: *I shake my head.* "No... I didn't. I think Mayuri ate the refrozen chicken. Salt didn't gelify."

Kurisu: "You mean nothing changed." *She looks at me, her eyes filled with curiosity.*

Okabe: *I start pacing around the room, thinking back on all our previous experiments.* "After the discharge phenomenon occurred last time, we spent all night experimenting with various food items. Nothing happened. The same thing with liquids. On that day, our success rate took a 180 degree turn. Before the discharge phenomenon, everything succeeded. After the discharge phenomenon, everything failed."

Kurisu: "Is the microwave storing electricity? You said that gelified objects became fractal structured, right? Salt has a simple structure by nature, so maybe that had an effect. But how could electricity be related..." *She muses, her brows furrowed in thought.*

Okabe: "Here, we should think under the assumptions of time travel theory." *I insist.*

Kurisu: "No. It's not good to start thinking from the conclusion." *She argues, shaking her head.*

Okabe: "We've already had several successful experiments. You can't deny that." *I argue back, feeling defensive.*

Kurisu: "I'm not especially concerned whether this thing is a time machine or not. To begin with, it's physically impossible for this tiny little microwave to produce energy equivalent to the big bang." *She says, frowning deeply.*

Okabe: *I can't help but feel a pang of frustration at her stubbornness.* "We can't reproduce the discharge phenomenon, nor the fractalization. There should be a reason why. We haven't changed our methods. We haven't changed the settings. We haven't changed the experimental subjects either. There must be some other variable."
