Mayuri: *I exchange a knowing glance with Faris and can't help but break into a warm smile.* "Well, Mayushii has a hard time saying Faris, so I call her Feris-chan instead!"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a light chuckle escaping my lips.* "Oh, so that’s it."

Faris: *I twirl a lock of my hair around my finger, my lips curving into a mischievous grin.* "It’s like we’re in a girl’s school. That’s not too... tabby."

Okabe: *I roll my eyes and cross my arms over my chest, trying to suppress a smile.* "Show me to the table already. How long do you want me to stand here waiting?"

Faris: *I giggle, my cat-like eyes twinkling with amusement.* "Nyahaha! Sorry, nya. Table for two, this way, nyan♪ Mayushii, I’ll leave it to you, nyan nyan."

Mayuri: *I give a small salute, my voice filled with determination.* "Leave it to me, nyan nyan♪" *I take Okabe's hand and lead him inside, my heart fluttering with excitement.* 

Okabe: *I let Mayuri guide me to Daru's table, my eyes taking in the café's unique charm.* 

Mayuri: *I point towards Daru, my voice filled with excitement.* "Daru-kun, Okarin is here, nyan."

Itaru: *I glance up from my phone, my voice filled with annoyance.* "You’re way late. Seriously, man."

Okabe: *I take a seat across from Daru, noticing his upset expression.* 

Itaru: *I lean forward, my curiosity piqued.* "So, what were you just talking about with Faris? I want details."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a smirk playing on my lips.* "...You really want to know? I don’t think you’d understand it."

Itaru: *I huff, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Ah, the usual... Your conversations are too much for regular otaku. You guys exude an aura or something, you know? It’s like you too have your own Reality Marble! You know I can’t forgive you!"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a thoughtful expression on my face.* "I think Feris-chan likes Okarin, nya. Of all the maids and masters here, nya, the only one who can keep up with Feris-chan is you, Okarin."
