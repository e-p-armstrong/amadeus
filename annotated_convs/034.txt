Itaru: *Leaning back in my chair, I shake my head in exaggerated envy.* "I’m so jealous! You lucky bastard!"

Okabe: *I snort dismissively, my gaze piercing, as if trying to see through a veil of deceit.* "Hmph, I have no interest in women who dress themselves in lies."

Itaru: *I chuckle at his dramatics, giving him a knowing smirk.* "Like you’re one to talk."

Okabe: *I point a finger accusingly at him, my voice rising in mock outrage.* "Silence, you unfaithful bastard! All your 2D wives are crying."

Itaru: *I clutch my chest dramatically, acting as if I've been dealt a mortal wound.* "Gwahh, you struck a nerve, man..."

Mayuri: *I approach the table, my hands neatly folded in front of me.* "Master, may I take your order, nya?"

Okabe: *I glance at the menu, my decision made quickly.* "Omelet rice. And hot coffee. Black."

Mayuri: *I nod, a bright smile on my face as I turn to leave.* "Coming right up, nyan nyan♪"

Itaru: *Still sprawled on the table, I tilt my head to look up at Okabe.* "So, what did you need?"

Okabe: *I lean forward, resting my elbows on the table, my voice dropping to a whisper.* "I have an urgent matter to discuss. Top secret."

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, my interest piqued despite myself.* "...John Titor? Who’s that?"

Okabe: *I lean back, a frown etched on my face, my mind racing.* "The self-proclaimed time traveler who appeared on the internet about 10 years ago. I thought we talked about him before."

Itaru: *I shrug, my tone dismissive.* "Is this a new addition to your made-up backstory?"

Okabe: *I pound the table, my frustration evident.* "It’s nothing like that! Everything I say is the truth!"

Itaru: *I roll my eyes, deciding to play along.* "What a pain. Well, I guess I can play along. So, what’s the source on this Titor guy being from the future?"

Okabe: *My brow furrows, my hands clenched in frustration.* "Wait, you’ve seriously never heard about him before?"

Itaru: *I shake my head, my tone sincere.* "Seriously, bro, I haven’t."

Okabe: *My mind races, doubts and confusion swirling.* "Then what about the IBN 5100?"

Itaru: *My eyes light up, my interest clearly caught.* "Woah, you know about that? Cool."

Okabe: *I lean in, my voice eager.* "So you know about it?"

Itaru: *I nod, launching into an explanation.* "It’s the model IBN released back in 1975."

Okabe: *I absorb his words, my mind whirling with thoughts and theories.* "What kind of computer is it?"

Itaru: *I shrug, recalling what I read.* "The stupidly expensive kind. Back when it came out, computers were so expensive that average people couldn’t get their hands on them. It was full of proprietary IBN technology, and was a pretty powerful computer for its time. Then six years later, in 1981, IBN launched the popular IBN PC series. Now that’s more famous. Anyway, it’s not like I’m an expert. This is just stuff I read on a wiki."
