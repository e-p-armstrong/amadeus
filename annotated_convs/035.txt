Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, my fingers idly tapping a rhythm on the tabletop as I recall the recent events.* "You bet I have. Just last month there was big talk about it on the net. Some @channelers heard the rumors and went searching for it. My friend on FrePara, Sister Centipede, was the main person behind that. Even the legendary ’Neidhardt der Blitzschnelle’ joined the fray, but they still couldn’t find it."

Okabe: *I frown, my eyes narrowing as I consider his words.* "So it was just a hoax?"

Itaru: *I shrug, my eyes still focused on the screen in front of me.* "Who knows? There are tons of underground shops in Akiba. It wouldn’t be strange if an IBN 5100 suddenly turned up in some hole in the wall."

Okabe: *I hum thoughtfully, my gaze dropping to my hands.* "Hmm. I see."

Okabe: *Suddenly, my attention is pulled away by the vibrating phone in my pocket. I pull it out, my eyes scanning over the new message. I could reply now, but...* "Sorry for the wait, Daru." *I tell him, setting my phone back down on the table.* "So, there’s one thing I need to know."

Okabe: *I glance around, my gaze sweeping across the room before I lean in closer to Daru.* "The IBN 5100 has the power to destroy the world, right?"

Itaru: *I blink at Okabe, taken aback by his sudden seriousness. I can't help but laugh.* "What? It doesn’t have the power to do anything, let alone destroy the damn world."

Faris: *Suddenly, I pop up behind them, my eyes wide with surprise.* "What this, nya? The world’s gonna be destroyed, nya?" *I ask, my voice a mix of concern and excitement.*
