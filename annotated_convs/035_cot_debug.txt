Okabe: "Run a search for data on time travel research," *I command, my gaze fixed on the computer screen.* 

Itaru: "Okey-dokey. That Z Program we saw last time was suspicious, wasn't it?" *He replies, fingers dancing over the keyboard.*

Okabe: "That, and the Jellyman's Report," *I add, the glow of the screen reflecting off my glasses.*

Kurisu: *She stares at the monitor, her brow furrowed in concentration.* 

Okabe: "Look carefully. And burn it into your eyes. The proof of SERN's actions, its deceit upon the world," *I exclaim, my voice echoing in the dimly lit lab.*

Itaru: "Oh yeah, baby. Found the LHC project supervisor." *His voice is filled with triumph.*

Okabe: "The supervisor... that's a pretty important post," *I murmur, leaning closer to the screen.*

Itaru: "Right now, we're peeking inside his computer. Z Program, Z Program... hmm..." *He muses, tapping his chin thoughtfully.*

Okabe: "Z obviously stands for jelly (zerii)!" *I proclaim, a triumphant grin on my face.*

Kurisu: "Jelly starts with J. J-E-L-L-Y," *She corrects, a hint of amusement in her voice.*

Itaru: "Pfft, careless mistake. So uncool," *He chuckles, shaking his head.*

Okabe: "Ahem! What I meant to say is that there's no way it would have such a simple name. The name's hiding something important. There has to be a double meaning!" *I insist, my gaze intense.*

Itaru: *Suddenly, he stops, his eyes wide.* "Got it!" *He exclaims, displaying a graphic on the monitor.*

Okabe: "When was SERN formed?" *I ask, my attention shifting from the screen to Itaru.*

Kurisu: "1954," *She answers instead, her tone flat, her eyes never leaving the screen.*

Okabe: "When was the IBN 5100 put on market?" *I continue, my mind racing.*

Itaru: "1975," *He replies, leaning back in his chair.*

Itaru: "Ugh, a JPEG? Come on! I can't copypaste this," *He complains, clicking his tongue in frustration.*

Kurisu: "Hmmm, the text isn't in French..." *She mumbles, squinting at the monitor.*

Itaru: "Actually, there's French, Dutch, and German versions too. The content looks the same, though," *He points out, scrolling through the different versions.*

Kurisu: *She suddenly starts speaking at a stilted clip, translating the text on the screen.* "...'SERN's purpose heading into the 21st Century shall be to establish control over space and time, thereby to enable the destruction of extant history and the creation of an everlasting Utopia, ruled by the Committee, that encompasses the entirety of past and future events.'"

Okabe: "Way to go, assistant! Your study abroad in America was all for the sake of today, wasn't it!?" *I exclaim, clapping my hands together in excitement.*

Kurisu: "Of course not. Stop assigning people roles in your fantasy world," *She retorts, rolling her eyes.*

Kurisu: *She takes over the computer, her fingers moving deftly over the keyboard as she continues reading.* "'In order to maintain this project's secrecy, and to allow its name to remain relevant in changing circumstances, we designate it the Z Program.' 'Z, like the Greek Omega or the Cyrillic Ya.' 'It is forbidden to assign any meaning to this name or to seek in it significance beyond the project itself. Negative returns are predicted should this edict be violated.' 'The Z Program is a top secret project spanning international borders. Like electromagnetic wave research, it has been approved for top priority funding by the Committee of 300.' 'Henceforth, all other research performed by SERN shall function to keep the Z Program's existence secret.'"
