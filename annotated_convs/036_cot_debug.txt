Planning:
The scene is set in a café where the main characters are gathered around a table. The characters in this scene are Faris, Itaru, and Okabe. 

Faris: A cheerful and energetic café worker who enjoys role-playing as a catgirl. She's also an avid gamer and is setting up a tournament. Her lines will be filled with enthusiasm, exaggerated gestures, and playful teasing.

Itaru: A laid-back, cheerful individual with a good-natured sense of humor. He's also a big fan of Faris. His lines will often contain light-hearted banter and playful comments.

Okabe: The main character who is often serious and dramatic. He's a friend of both Faris and Itaru and often gets caught up in their antics. His lines will be reflective, often including internal monologues and thought-provoking statements.

Anchor Lines: Faris's line "Even though it’s painful... no, because it’s painful, I succeeded my brother’s dying wish and purrfected my skills as a RaiNetter, nya!" will be one of the anchor lines. This line will be used to showcase Faris's dedication and passion for gaming, as well as her playful nature. The second anchor line will be Okabe's line "RaiNet AccessBattlers, huh... Whenever I hear that name, I remember the former champion... Has it already been two years? No, it’s nothing. Forget what I said." This line will be used to showcase Okabe's reflective nature and his tendency to get lost in his thoughts.

Roleplay:

Faris: *I skip towards the table, balancing a plate of omelet rice in one hand.* "Master, thanks for waiting nyan nyan♪ Omelet rice, nyan!" *I set the dish down, reaching into my apron pocket to pull out a bottle of ketchup. With a flourish, I use it to write 'THE WORLD IS DOOMED!!' on the omelet's blank yellow canvas.*

Faris: *I step back, placing a hand on my hip and flashing a triumphant grin.* "Please enjoy your meal before the world ends♪"

Itaru: *I let out a whistle of admiration, pointing at the omelet.* "Woah, ’The World is Doomed!!’ for the win! Faris’s handwriting is so cute it puts my ’omelet’ in danger too!" *My eyes dance with mirth, but I notice Okabe's stern gaze. He looks like he's about to lecture me, but I simply shrug, not letting his seriousness dampen my mood.*

Okabe: *Seeing Itaru's amusement, I shake my head. With the back of my spoon, I smooth out the ketchup, erasing the playful message.* "Ahh... what a waste..." *I mutter, focusing on the food in front of me. It doesn't matter what's written on it, after all. I'm going to eat it either way.*

Faris: *Turning my attention to Itaru, I cock my head to the side.* "Daru-nyan, Daru-nyan, have you considered participating in the Faris Cup, nya?"

Itaru: *I perk up at the mention of the tournament.* "Yeah, of course I’m participating!"

Okabe: *I pause, spoon midway to my mouth.* "Faris Cup? What’s that?" *I ask, taking a mouthful of omelet rice.*

Faris: *I start bouncing on my toes, excitement brimming in my voice.* "Next Sunday, we’re hosting a RaiNet tournament at the cafe, nya!" *I try to contain my excitement, but it's hard. I can't help but jump around, even though I know I should be more careful when people are eating nearby.*

Faris: *I stop bouncing, standing tall and proud.* "Faris is the event organizer. It’s all my idea, nyan! You can participate too if you want, Kyouma! Entrance fee is 1000 yen and includes a drink. Whoever beats Faris gets to enjoy some of Faris’ home-cooking, nya."

Itaru: *I snort, shaking my head at Faris's offer.* "It’ll never happen. Okarin sucks at RaiNet."

Faris: *I tilt my head, a teasing smile on my lips.* "Nya? But it’s so fun."

Okabe: *I push the plate away, a sigh escaping my lips.* "No, I’m fine..." *I pause, my gaze distant.* "RaiNet AccessBattlers, huh... Whenever I hear that name, I remember the former champion... Has it already been two years? No, it’s nothing. Forget what I said." *I quickly dismiss my thoughts, not wanting to delve into the past.*

Faris: *I gasp, my eyes wide with curiosity.* "NyaNya? That sounded so serious, nya! Who was the former champion, nya?"

Itaru: *I shrug, a skeptical look on my face.* "He probably doesn’t exist. I mean, RaiNet didn’t even have official tournaments until about a year ago."

Faris: *I lean forward, my eyes locked onto Okabe.* "Kyouma... you still can’t forget him, can you, nya?"

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by Faris's words.* "What?"

Faris: *I smile, my tone softening.* "I remember that you and the champion -- my brother -- were such good friends, Kyouma. You were so close it made me jealous, nya." *I sigh, shaking my head.* "But it’s time to let go of the past! Seize the day with your own paws!" *I declare, my voice echoing throughout the store. I point at Okabe, my resolve unwavering.* "Even though it’s painful... no, because it’s painful, I succeeded my brother’s dying wish and purrfected my skills as a RaiNetter, nya! Do you remember, nya? He always used to say, ’Some day, let’s bring peace to the world with RaiNet--’"

Okabe: *I flinch, taken aback by Faris's sudden outburst. I never even said anything about him being her brother! Hell, I don’t know if Faris even has siblings! I shouldn’t have talked about stuff like this in front of Faris! I quickly shake my head, trying to dismiss the conversation.* "Let's just eat," *I mutter, returning my attention to my meal.*
