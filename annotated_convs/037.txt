Faris: *I tilt my head slightly, my cat ears bobbing as I question Okabe with a sparkle in my eyes.* "NyaNya?"

Okabe: *I present my empty plate to Faris, my movements quick and practiced, a result of years of evading imagined adversaries. I offer her a small, grateful nod, my eyes darting around the cafe, always on guard.* "I'm finished."

Faris: *My eyes light up at Okabe's empty plate. I reach out, my fingers wrapping around the edge of the dish, feeling the slight warmth from the food that was once there.* "Sure thing, Master! Just a moment, nya♪" *I twirl around, my maid outfit swirling around me as I head back to the counter, a spring in my step.*

Okabe: *As Faris moves away, I let out a soft sigh of relief, sinking deeper into my chair. I rub my temples, the corners of my lips curling up into a wry smile. I had successfully navigated another episode of Faris' fantasy world.*

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, my eyes following Faris with an appreciative gaze.* "Faris is one of the most skilled Rainetters I know." *I say, my voice carrying a note of admiration.*

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow at Daru, my curiosity piqued.* "Is that so?"

Itaru: *I nod, a wry smile playing on my lips as I recall Faris' victories.* "She’s gone undefeated in over 400 unofficial matches."

Okabe: *I lean back, crossing my arms over my chest, a smirk playing on my lips.* "Is she Rickson Gracie?"

Itaru: *I ignore Okabe's attempt at humor, choosing to continue my praises for Faris.* "It’s so disappointing that Faris doesn’t go to official tournaments. She’d win if she did, no doubt."

Okabe: *I lean forward, resting my elbows on the table, my fingers laced together.* "Why doesn’t she?"

Itaru: *I shrug, my gaze drifting back to Faris who was busily moving around the counter.* "I’m sure it’s for the customers! She probably doesn’t want to inconvenience the store. Truly a model maid. Also, she’s Mayushii’s age, so she probably has school too."

Okabe: *I scoff, rolling my eyes at Daru's explanation.* "She doesn’t want to inconvenience the store, yet she’s holding the Faris Cup here?"

Itaru: *I laugh, my shoulders shaking with mirth.* "That doesn’t matter at all! The point is, Faris is cute, and cuteness is justice. Cute cat-eared maids are sweet, if you know what I mean. And that’s all that matters, right?"

Okabe: *I narrow my eyes at Daru, my lips curled into a teasing smirk.* "So in the end, do you bat for the 2D team, or the 3D team?"

Itaru: *I grin, my eyes sparkling with mischief. I dramatically place my hand over my heart, my voice firm and resolute.* "I dare say I’m bi!"

Okabe: *I chuckle, shaking my head at Daru's revelation, a sense of fondness creeping into my smile.* "You’re an inspiration, Daru."

Itaru: *I puff out my chest, a triumphant grin on my face.* "I know. I’m just too awesome."
