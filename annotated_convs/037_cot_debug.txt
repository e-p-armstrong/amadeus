Itaru: "H-hey, Okarin. Remember when we hacked in before? I'm pretty sure that email we read said this... Result: Error. Human is dead, mismatch. For details, see the Jellyman's Report..." *His hands tremble slightly as he speaks.*

Okabe: *I swallow hard, a chill running down my spine.* "Someone... died? Could that have something to do with... human experimentation?"

Okabe: "Daru... look up the Jellyman's Report." *I instruct, my voice barely above a whisper.*

Itaru: "Really?" *He raises an eyebrow, unsure.*

Okabe: "Really. But first, Christina." *I turn to Kurisu, my eyes serious.*

Kurisu: "Eh?" *She blinks, taken aback.*

Okabe: "You should leave." *I tell her firmly, my gaze unwavering.*

Kurisu: "Why are you suddenly--" *She starts to argue, her brows furrowing in confusion.*

Okabe: "The Jellyman's Report... it just gives me a bad feeling. Once we see it, we can no longer return to our normal lives. You're a genius. You're already published, for crying out loud. There's no need to throw away your promising future." *I insist, trying to protect her.*

Kurisu: "Are you worried about me?" *She asks, her expression softening.*

Okabe: "Of course I am. You are my assistant, after all." *I answer, my tone gentle.*

Kurisu: "...I keep telling you, I'm not your assistant. Thanks for your concern. But I'm not leaving. We need to expose this truth to the world." *She declares, her voice steady and resolute.*

Okabe: "No! It's too dangerous." *I argue, my worry for her evident.*

Kurisu: "You chickening out?" *She challenges, her eyes sparkling with determination.*

Okabe: "We're powerless against this conspiracy. One wrong move, and they'll have us erased." *I try to reason with her.*

Kurisu: "But still--" *She starts to argue, but I cut her off.*

Okabe: "This isn't a game! I'm not joking here." *I plead, my voice strained with urgency.*

Kurisu: "...Fine. I won't tell anyone." *She finally agrees, her eyes showing her resolve.*

Okabe: "But I'm not leaving. It'll keep me awake at night." *She adds, her voice soft but firm.*

Okabe: "You won't regret this?" *I ask, looking into her eyes.*

Kurisu: "I won't." *She declares, her eyes meeting mine.*

Okabe: "What about you, Daru? Prepared?" *I turn to Daru, my gaze questioning.*

Itaru: "Well, I am a super hacker." *He answers, his voice confident.*

Okabe: "Alright... let's begin." *I say, looking at each of them.*

Okabe: "Henceforth, this shall be known as Operation Laegjarn's Chest!" *I declare, trying to lighten the mood.*

Kurisu: "Why Norse mythology?" *She questions, her brows furrowing.*

Itaru: "Is that Norse mythology? Because it's cool, I guess." *He answers, shrugging.*

Kurisu: "Anyway, what is it with men and military terms..." *She mutters under her breath, shaking her head.*
