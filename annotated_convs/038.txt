Okabe: *I scrutinize the ancient PC, finding it hard to believe that such a relic could still be operational.* "I mean, it’s a 20-year-old machine with specs lower than my cellphone."

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, shooting Okabe a casual shrug.* "It’s cool. Duh."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, tilting my head slightly in contemplation.* "So, it’s like the reason why some protagonists are odd-eyed even though they’re Japanese?"

Itaru: *I blink at Okabe, my expression clearly communicating my confusion.* "Not getting you, bro."

Okabe: *I chuckle, shaking my head at Itaru's inability to understand my point.* "It’s cool."

Itaru: *I nod, accepting Okabe's response with a smirk.* "If it’s cool, then it’s cool. Anyway, there wasn’t much of an option. This was the only PC we weren’t using."

Okabe: *I glance over at Itaru's sleek, new computer.* "What about your new one?"

Itaru: *I immediately shake my head, my tone firm and resolute.* "No way. We don’t know what could happen when it’s connected to your crazy machine. It could kill the performance."

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, muttering under my breath.* "Selfish bastard. Besides, we made the PhoneWave (name subject to change) together. It’s our crazy machine."

Itaru: *I ignore Okabe's comment, choosing to steer the conversation back to the experiment.* "Anyway, did you do any research on the gelification?"

Okabe: *I nod, recalling my visit to the university.* "Yeah, at the university this morning."

Okabe: *I furrow my brow, plagued by the mystery of the gelified banana.* "Why would a banana gelify? What kind of science are we dealing with here?"

Okabe: *I look at Itaru, my voice steady as I relay my findings.* "I examined a sample under a microscope and found it was shredded at the molecular level."

Itaru: *I blink, clearly taken aback.* "Shredded?"

Okabe: *I nod, my expression turning serious.* "It’s not a mere phase transition. The banana became something entirely different."

Itaru: *I rub my chin, trying to make sense of Okabe's explanation.* "Could it have rotted? ...Nah. There’s no way 2 minutes in the microwave could do that."

Okabe: *I shake my head, introducing my theory.* "Then I remembered about fractal structures."

Itaru: *I lean forward, interest piqued.* "The Menger sponge thing?"

Okabe: *I nod, my eyes gleaming with excitement as I explain further.* "Yeah. It looked like something drilled holes into the banana. An infinite number of holes in a fractal pattern, right down to the nano level."

Itaru: *I gape at Okabe, completely flabbergasted.* "Whoa. What could do something like that?"

Okabe: *I pause, letting the tension build before revealing my hypothesis.* "I have one hypothesis..."

Okabe: *I savor the dramatic pause, noting Daru's anticipation with a smirk.* 

Okabe: *I lean forward, my voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.* "It’s the result of the microwave’s electromagnetic waves."

Itaru: *I stammer, my eyes wide with surprise.* "W-what does that mean?"

Okabe: *I grin, my voice rising with triumphant excitement.* "If my guess is correct, then our PhoneWave (name subject to change) has the potential to become a weapon of unprecedented destructive power, one that could change the face of war as we know it. Hehehe."

Okabe: *I pull out my phone, my maniacal grin never leaving my face.* "It’s me. We’re proceeding to stage two of the plan. Soon they will learn... that Judgment Day is near. All shall be as Steins Gate wills. Resistance is futile. El Psy Kongroo."

Itaru: *I sigh, rolling my eyes at Okabe's theatrics.* "Quit talking to your imaginary friend. I’m done with the wiring."

Okabe: *I glance at the mess of wires, choosing to keep my contact's identity a secret.* "I want to explain that he’s not imaginary, but revealing the identity of my contact would be a betrayal. The last thing I need is another enemy, especially one whose power and cunning rivals that of the Organization."

Okabe: *I look at the PhoneWave (name subject to change), now an indecipherable mess of wires.* "The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is now an indecipherable mess of wires. All we did was hook it up to a computer, yet it turned out like something MacDyver would put together. Now we can access the microwave’s terminal mode and see exactly what’s going on in its computer brain."

Itaru: *I stretch, cracking my knuckles as I prepare for the next step.* "Well? What’s next?"

Okabe: *I smirk, holding up a bunch of bananas.* "We have bananas."
