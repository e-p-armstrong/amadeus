Kurisu: "The man's body... was completely gelified." *She states, her voice barely above a whisper in the eerie silence of our lab. Her eyes, wide with horror, are glued to the gruesome image displayed on the monitor.*

Okabe: *I find myself subconsciously reaching for the door lock, ensuring it's secure. My other hand instinctively moves to the remaining banana next to the computer, drawing a comparison between our failed experiments and this horrific discovery.* 

Itaru: "What's going on here?" *He breaks the silence with a disbelieving whisper, his eyes meeting mine in a shared moment of dread.* "They... gelified someone?"

Kurisu: "They're experimenting on people..." *She breaks in, her voice filled with grim understanding. Her gaze never leaves the screen, the gruesome image reflected in her glasses.*

Kurisu: "And this means they've created a time machine, doesn't it? Even if it's not perfect."

Okabe: "Eh...?" *I stammer, my mind reeling from the implications of her words. I glance back at the monitor, my gaze fixated on the old newspaper article.*

Kurisu: "This New York Times article is from 1921." 

Okabe: "90 years ago..." *I murmur, the reality of our discovery slowly sinking in.* 

Kurisu: "Look." *She points to part of the black and white photograph, her finger shaking slightly. The gelified corpse of a man... with the SERN logo on his shoulder.*

Okabe: "SERN..." *I breathe out, my eyes widening in realization.*

Itaru: "So... SERN used the LHC to send someone back to 1921?" 

Kurisu: "Looks like they failed to keep him alive, though."

Okabe: "Is this the only report?" *I ask, my voice filled with dread.*

Itaru: "No, there's more. Looks like... 14 people in total."

Okabe: "More Jellymen? That means more gelified people... more victims of human experimentation..." *I swallow hard, a chill running down my spine as I reach for a cold can of Dr P from the fridge.* "Show me the others."

Kurisu: *As Itaru pulls up another report, Kurisu begins translating out loud, her voice steady despite the disturbing content.* "'Jellyman's Report 9.' 'Subject: Dan Strayski, Age: 26, Canadian.' 'Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2004-9-6 T 14:10.' 'Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.' The newspaper clipping... I think it's in French. I can't read it."

Okabe: "You can read the date, though. January 31, 2001." *I point out, my gaze moving from the report to Kurisu's grim expression.*

Kurisu: "The location is... Pau, France, I guess." *She continues, her voice barely audible.*

Kurisu: *As Itaru brings up the next report, Kurisu begins translating again, her voice growing slightly shaky.* "'Jellyman's Report 8.' 'Subject: Linda Hill, Age: 25, British' 'Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2004-2-15 T 13:45' 'Results: Error. Human is Dead. Mismatch.' 'October 2, 1972. The gelified body of a woman was discovered on the streets of Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu, India.' 'There were signs that the body had been run over by a car.'"

Kurisu: *Without missing a beat, she moves on to the next report.* "'Jellyman's Report 7.' 'Subject: Michael Lang, Age: 33, German' 'Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2002-10-8 T 13:28' 'Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.'"
