Kurisu: "'Jellyman's Report 6.' 'Subject: Mark Hughes, Age: 30, American' 'Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2002-8-23 T 12:52' 'Result: Error. Human is Dead. Mismatch.'" *She reads aloud from the report, her brows furrowed in concentration.* "'On July 1, 1985, a strange body washed ashore on the coast of Streymoy, Faroe Islands.' 'It appeared to be the body of an adult male, but its flesh was soft like that of a jellyfish. Some of the island's inhabitants believe that it was the body of a merman.' 'The inscription 'SERN' was found near the body's shoulder, but SERN denies any involvement.'"

Itaru: "Keep looking?" *He asks, his hands hovering over the keyboard.*

Okabe: "I've seen enough." *I lean back in my chair, a look of troubled thought on my face.* 

Kurisu: "The sites are spread throughout the world. What can we deduce from this?" *She looks at me, her eyes questioning.*

Okabe: "They must have sent them to those places." *I respond, my gaze meeting hers.*

Kurisu: "I don't think so. It's too random." *She shakes her head, her hand idly playing with a strand of her hair.*

Itaru: "There was something about Kerr black holes and gravity, right? Isn't that the cause?" *He interjects, his eyes still glued to the screen.*

Kurisu: "It is believed that due to infinite compression by supergravity, the subject could not endure passage through the Kerr black hole's singularity.' That's what it said." *She clarifies, her voice steady.*

Itaru: "What's a Kerr black hole? Is it different from a regular black hole?" *He asks, finally turning to look at Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "It's a theoretical black hole with a rotating singularity. Their existence hasn't been proven yet. Not that there's any way to prove one exists." *She explains, folding her arms across her chest.*

Okabe: "That's right... John Titor!" *I exclaim, a sudden realization hitting me.*

Kurisu: "Creating Kerr black holes? That's insane. If you screw up, it could swallow the Earth... and besides, Kerr black holes are just a theoretical construct." *She murmurs, a frown creasing her forehead.*

Okabe: "If Titor's predictions are a reality, then that means the LHC worst case scenario video on MewTube was right." *I insist, my voice filled with determination.*

Itaru: "I don't know about Titor's predictions, but I've seen the problem video before. It was on the news two or three years ago." *He shrugs, turning his attention back to the computer.*

Kurisu: "The gravitational forces inside a black hole are unbelievably powerful. It's certainly possible that passing through one could allow time displacement, but there's no way a human could do that and come out alive." *She states, her expression serious.*

Okabe: "That must be how these people got gelified." *I say, my eyes wide with the implications.*

Kurisu: "It wouldn't just gelify you. It would tear you apart particle from particle. That's what a black hole does." *She counters, her tone grave.*

Itaru: "Before we discuss this, shouldn't we look through the rest of their time machine research?" *He suggests, already beginning to pull up new documents.*

Okabe: "Daru is my Favorite Right Arm." *I declare, a proud grin spreading across my face.*

Kurisu: "I thought he was your super hacka." *She teases, a small smile playing on her lips.*

Itaru: "Hacker!" *He corrects with a laugh.*

Okabe: "So what does it say, Christina?" *I ask, eager to hear her translation.*

Kurisu: "Umm... can you give me some time to read it?" *She requests, her eyes darting across the lines of text as she mutters to herself.*

Okabe: "What are you muttering about? Tell me what it says." *I press, my curiosity getting the better of me.*

Kurisu: "...Oh, right. You know, this feels like one big joke." *She sighs, shaking her head in disbelief.*
