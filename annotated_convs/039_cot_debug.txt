Planning stage: 

Characters involved:

1. Itaru (Daru): He's the team's go-to hacker and a hardcore otaku. He has a laid-back personality but can be serious when the situation calls for it. His actions and thoughts will reflect his nonchalant nature and his love for otaku culture.

2. Okabe: The protagonist, a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He's dramatic, flamboyant, and has a flair for theatricality. His actions and thoughts will be intense, vivid, and sometimes over-the-top, reflecting his larger-than-life personality.

3. Guidance (Mayushii Guidance system): The automated system for the PhoneWave, its lines will stay more or less the same, as it's a machine and not a human character.

Word Choices/Writing Styles:

For Daru, I'll use casual, laid-back language. His actions will be simple and nonchalant.

For Okabe, I'll use grandiose, dramatic language. His actions will be flamboyant and intense.

Scene Anchors:

1. Okabe: "We’ll never reshape the fabric of society as long as money dictates the limits of our science." This line showcases Okabe's passion and determination. 

2. Okabe: "Well, have you ever nuked yourself inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change)?" This line highlights Okabe's unique sense of humor.

Roleplay:

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow at Okabe, my fingers never leaving the keyboard as I continue typing.* "You do realize Mayu-shi’s gonna cry if you use all those bananas, right? Wasn’t it her money?"

Okabe: *I shrug, a smirk playing on my lips as I gaze at the bananas.* "She generously donated that money to our world-changing research efforts."

Itaru: *I roll my eyes at his theatrics.* "You don’t have to use the whole bunch, Okabe. One is enough. Just one."

*I watch as Daru retrieves the bananas, peels one from the bunch, and sticks it back inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change).*

Okabe: *I cross my arms and stare at the machine, the gears in my mind turning.* "We’ll never reshape the fabric of society as long as money dictates the limits of our science."

Itaru: *I snort, shaking my head in disbelief.* "You’re the only one who wants to reshape society, Okarin."

*I can't help but notice his lack of enthusiasm the second we got back to the lab. Such a fickle man.*

Itaru: *I glance at the microwave, then back to Okabe.* "C’mon, start the timer already."

*I quickly scan the room, my eyes landing on my phone. Snatching it up, I complete the call.*

Guidance: "Hello. This is the PhoneWave (name subject to change)."

*Ah, the Mayushii Guidance system. A familiar voice in this whirlwind of scientific endeavors.*

Guidance: "You can operate the timer from this menu. After pushing the # button, please enter the heating time in seconds."

Okabe: *I sigh, tapping my foot impatiently.* "In hindsight, we should’ve made the Mayushii Guidance skippable. Having to wait each time is quite annoying."

Guidance: "For example, press ’#60’ for one minute. For two minutes, press ’#120’."

*Finally, the guidance is over. I quickly enter 120# into the phone. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) starts up with a low hum.*

Itaru: *I look over at Okabe, an amused smile on my face.* "You messed up."

*I curse under my breath, quickly resetting the timer and entering 120# again. The turntable inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change) begins to spin backwards.*

Okabe: *I lean against the lab table, crossing my arms.* "Two minutes sure is long..."

*There's no real reason for it to be two minutes, other than that's how Mayuri had it when she first discovered the freezing function. We've experimented with different times, but two minutes seems to be the sweet spot.*

Itaru: *I look at Okabe, my brow furrowed.* "You know, if the microwave’s emissions are doing it, then shouldn’t our cells be getting gelified too?"

*Despite his bored expression, I can tell Daru is finally getting into the discussion.*

Okabe: *I chuckle, shaking my head.* "Well, have you ever nuked yourself inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change)?"

Itaru: *I roll my eyes, giving Okabe a flat look.* "I can’t even fit in there. Anyway, what’s your source on the electromagnetic waves?"

Okabe: *I smirk, my eyes gleaming with excitement.* "If you must know... it’s my mad scientist’s intuition."

Itaru: *I snort, shaking my head.* "Oh, so no facts."

Okabe: *I raise a finger, a grin spreading across my face.* "Edison once said, ’Without one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent of perspiration is wasted. So, inventors of the world... be inspired!’ End quote."

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, a small smile playing on my lips.* "Wasn’t it ’Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration’?"
