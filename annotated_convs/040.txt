Itaru: *I squint at Okabe, my fingers drumming on the table in a steady rhythm.* "Edison said that? 'Be inspired!'...?"

Okabe: *I nod, my hands animatedly gesticulating in the air as if conducting an unseen orchestra.* "Yes. 'Be inspired!' he said."

Okabe: *I can't quite remember if that was exactly what he said, but it was something along those lines, according to the wiki.* "Therefore, as a genius mad scientist, I am always insp--"

Okabe: *My words are cut off by the ringing of the PhoneWave (name subject to change). My eyes narrow, a frown creasing my forehead.* "This is just going to gelify the banana like usual, isn’t it? We need a new experiment."

Okabe: *A sigh escapes my lips as I glance at the PhoneWave, feeling as if I wasted 120 seconds on nothing. I watch as Daru opens the microwave's door and peeks inside.*

Itaru: *My eyes widen, my fingers trembling slightly as they grip the microwave door.* "What? What!?"

Okabe: *I watch Daru, my brows furrowed in confusion.* "What are you doing?"

Itaru: *I gulp, my gaze still locked onto the empty microwave.* "Well... uh... it’s... ...gone."

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat.* "Gone? What’s gone?"

Itaru: *I swallow hard, my voice barely above a whisper.* "The banana."

Okabe: *Pushing Daru aside, I peer into the PhoneWave, my heart pounding in my chest.* "...It’s gone."

Okabe: *I take a moment to collect myself, my hand reaching for my phone. The room is silent as I speak into the device, my voice low.* "It’s me. Slight problem. We may have awakened something... terrible."

Itaru: *My voice shakes, my eyes wide with fear.* "Wh-what do you mean something terrible!?"

Okabe: *I ignore Daru’s panicked cry, trying to maintain my calm despite the pounding in my chest.* "I’m invoking Emergency Order 666. Activate the Coldheart Protocol! What!? What do you mean we need congressional approval!? There’s no time, you fool! Tokyo will be blasted to atoms!"

Okabe: *I end the call, shoving my phone back into my pocket, my mind racing with possibilities.*

Itaru: *I let out a shaky laugh, my eyes still wide with fear.* "Y-you should be an actor."

Okabe: *I snap at Daru, my voice trembling slightly.* "S-shut up, you Faris stalker! Where’d you hide the banana?"

Itaru: *I frown, my voice rising in indignation.* "Who’s a stalker!?"

Okabe: *My gaze locks onto Daru, suspicion etched on my face.* "The banana. Where is it? Are you planning on becoming a street magician or something?"

Itaru: *I shake my head, my hands up in a defensive gesture.* "You’re the one who hid it, aren’t you?"

Okabe: *My throat feels dry, the silence in the room heavy and uncomfortable.* "Where the hell did it go!?"

Itaru: *I shrug, my hands spread wide in helplessness.* "How should I know!?"

Okabe: *I call out to the missing banana, my voice echoing in the empty room.* "Where did you go? Banaana! BANAAANA!"

Okabe: *I take the turntable out of the microwave, my fingers searching every nook and cranny, but find neither peel nor stem of the banana.* "W-wait... I think I get it now! It’s not an electromagnetic weapon, it’s a teleportation device!"

Itaru: *I blink, my mouth falling open in disbelief.* "Wh-what!? Wait, that’s absurd."

Okabe: *I insist, my heart pounding with excitement and fear.* "How else could it have vanished? The microwave was closed!"

Itaru: *I take a deep breath, my hands shaking slightly.* "Um, maybe we should just calm down."

Okabe: *I nod, my heart still racing.* "Y-yeah. You’re right..."

Okabe: *I reach for the bunch of bananas, hoping the familiar action will calm me down. But my hand freezes mid-air, my eyes widening in disbelief.* "What... the...!?"
