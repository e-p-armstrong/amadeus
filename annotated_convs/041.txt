Okabe: *As Daru's hand stretches out to touch the gelified banana, I instinctively step forward, my hand shooting out to stop him.* "Wait! How many bananas are in the lab right now!?"

Itaru: *I scratch the back of my head, my eyes scanning the lab uncertainly.* "J-just these, I think..."

Okabe: *My eyes narrow, focusing on the gelbana, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Is this gelbana attached to the same stem as the banana you just picked?"

Itaru: *I shrug, my eyes never leaving the game on my computer screen.* "I dunno, man... I wasn’t paying attention. It doesn’t look like it was ever plucked..."

Okabe: *My gaze remains fixed on the gelbana, my mind racing as I consider the impossible.* "H-hey, Daru... could this possibly be..." *I hesitate, my words hanging in the air. The implications are too vast, too incredible. But the evidence is right in front of us.*

Okabe: "A teleporter... we’ve invented a teleporter!" *I exclaim, my voice echoing in the silent lab, a mix of disbelief and excitement.*

Kurisu: *From the lounge, I raise an eyebrow, a hint of curiosity seeping into my voice.* "Oh?"

Kurisu: *My gaze lands on the gelbana, my scientific curiosity piqued.* "That looks like an interesting experiment."

Okabe: *Startled, I spin around, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Who’s there!?" *I demand, my eyes wide with surprise.*

Okabe: "Impossible! What are you doing here!? The 18-year-old genius girl! A sadist who humiliates men in public! Also known as The Zombie! Makise... Kurisu!" *I point at her accusingly, my voice shaking with shock and suspicion.*

Itaru: *I chuckle, glancing at Okabe with an amused smirk.* "Nice exposition, bro."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, my eyes narrowing at Okabe's words.* "Who are you calling a zombie?"

Okabe: *My mind races, my paranoia bubbling to the surface.* "What is the meaning of this!? What is your purpose here?"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, a hint of annoyance creeping into my voice.* "I’m here to see you, Okabe Rintaro-san. Or is it Hououin Kyouma-san?"

Okabe: *My breath catches in my throat, my eyes widening in shock.* "I was right! You’re one of the Organization’s top agents, an esper with superhuman powers! No wonder you rose from the dead!"

Kurisu: *I sigh, rolling my eyes once more at Okabe's dramatics.* "I’m not dead, alright? Please stop killing me off. Hashida-san, can you do something about this guy?"

Itaru: *I laugh, shaking my head at the unfolding scene.* "You came at a bad time, Makise-shi, with Okarin freaking out like this."

Okabe: *I whip my head towards Daru, my eyes blazing with betrayal.* "Have you betrayed me, Daru!?"

Itaru: *I raise my hands in a placating gesture, trying to defuse the situation.* "Calm down, man."

Okabe: *My mind races, the seeds of suspicion taking root.* "Are you being blackmailed? Or did she seduce you?" *I accuse, my gaze darting between Daru and Kurisu.*

Okabe: *With a growl, I step forward, my fist clenching at my side.* "YOU’VE CROSSED THE LINE, BIIITTCH!"

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, maintaining my composure despite Okabe's outburst.* "Get ahold of yourself."

Kurisu: *With a sigh, I turn to Daru, my patience wearing thin.* "Hashida-san gave me the address after yesterday’s lecture. He also told me your name."
