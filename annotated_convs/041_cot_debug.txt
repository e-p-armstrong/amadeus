Kurisu: *She turns towards me, a determined look in her eyes.* "When the event horizon disappears, there's no more reason for time and space to change places. Meaning that you can enter a naked singularity without being trapped. And then the existence of the naked singularity allows the principle of causality to be violated and the general theory of relativity to fail. The laws of physics are broken!"

Okabe: "C-can such a thing exist?" *I ask, my eyes wide with fascination and fear.*

Kurisu: "Nothing in principle stops Kerr black holes from existing. It seems inconsistent, but the math never lies. Since the principle of causality fails, it would be possible to travel to the past by entering a naked singularity." *She states, her voice steady and confident.*

Kurisu: *She tilts her head, looking at a picture of the LHC on her laptop.* "One thing I don't understand is how they inject electrons into the singularity. Look. This is a picture of the LHC, but there's strange equipment installed at the proton collision site. It looks like they call it a 'lifter', but... just what is it?"

Okabe: "Daru, have you heard of it?" *I turn to Daru, my eyebrows furrowed in curiosity.*

Itaru: "Lifter, lifter... I think I saw that in the Z Program files. Wanna google it?" *He offers, already pulling up a browser window.*

Itaru: "We've got hits!" *He exclaims, excitement lighting up his face.*

Kurisu: "That many? I guess it's not a secret..." *She muses, leaning closer to the screen.*

Okabe: "Could this be it? Ionocraft." *I suggest, pointing at one of the search results.*

Kurisu: "Ions are charged particles. The meaning matches." *She nods, clicking on a link that says Ionocraft (lifter).*

Itaru: "It's floating..." *He whispers in awe, as we watch a video of a metallic triangle floating into the air.*

Okabe: "That's... an anti-gravity device!" *I exclaim, pointing at the screen.*

Kurisu: "Don't be ridiculous. That would be the breakthrough of the century. It's called an ionocraft, so it probably has something to do with electrodes and charged air..." *She argues, though she doesn't sound as confident as she usually does.*

Okabe: "SERN is using this lifter technology. It's a vital component of their time machine. If they can manipulate a micro singularity's mass and gravitational field, then these things really are anti-gravity devices!" *I insist, my mind racing with the implications.*

Kurisu: "Well, under those exact conditions, I guess you might not be entirely wrong." *She concedes, seeming to consider my words.*

Kurisu: *She leans back in her chair, folding her arms.* "But it looks like SERN's having trouble adjusting their lifter. They don't have full control over the micro singularity's gravity. So they can't make a true naked singularity."

Okabe: "That must be the reason why the subjects turned into jellymen." *I conclude, a chill running down my spine at the thought.*

Kurisu: *She nods, her expression serious.* "Since the singularity is still closed, the subject is crushed by its tremendous gravity. As a result, substances become fractalized. Let's go with that hypothesis. Of course, there's no way to be sure that it's right. It might take months to prove."
