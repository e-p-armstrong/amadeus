Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, crossing my arms over my chest.* "So you’re here to see me, is that it?"

Kurisu: *I fold my arms, my gaze steady and unyielding.* "Yes. You claimed to have seen me die. I came to see if that was the truth, or just a pathetic excuse to grope me. I came for the answer."

Okabe: *I wince at her words, memories of yesterday's incident flashing in my mind. I quickly shake my head, trying to dispel the thoughts.* "Now that you mention it, you did treat me like I was a perv yesterday. Well... I suppose I should be grateful that you didn’t call the cops on me after what I did. But what choice did I have? Anybody would react the same way if a dead person reappeared before them. Right?"

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, my expression skeptical.* "But your current behavior is all the answer I need. It was all an act to grope me. My initial hypothesis was correct."

Okabe: *I sit up straighter, indignation rising in me.* "Not so fast. There’s more to this than you know."

Okabe: *I clench my fists, determination setting in.* "I must clear my name, or I’ll be labeled as a perv forever!"

Kurisu: *I sigh, rubbing my temples.* "Anyway, let’s put that aside for now."

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, relief washing over me.* "R-really?"

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu enters the development room with a quick, confident stride. Her presence seems to fill the cramped room, driving me and Daru to the corners.* "That’s a relief. I was sure she was going to call the police. But that 'for now' part bothers me. Can’t she tell this area’s off limits!?"

Kurisu: *I turn to face him, my hand extended.* "I haven’t properly introduced myself yet, have I? I’m Makise Kurisu. Pleased to meet you."

Okabe: *I stare at her outstretched hand, my mind racing.* "She holds out her hand. What is she trying to do? Shoot lightning from her fingertips!?"

Kurisu: *I frown, my hand still extended.* "You can’t even shake hands? Are all Japanese men this difficult?"

Okabe: *I nervously glance at her hand, then back up to her face.* "Shake hands? This girl genius is asking for a handshake? We only met yesterday, and just moments ago she was on the verge of calling the cops."

Okabe: *I look at her in disbelief.* "You’re not Japanese!?"

Kurisu: *I shrug nonchalantly.* "I’ve lived in America for seven years. What about it?"

Okabe: *I stare at her, my mind trying to process this new information.* "America..."

Okabe: *I look down at her slender fingers. Glossy, healthy fingernails. No unnecessary nail polish. I stare, fixated. Slowly, I extend my hand, making sure to keep enough weight on my heels so I can flee at a moment’s notice. I lightly grab the tip of Kurisu’s index finger between my thumb and index finger, then instantly let go.* 

Kurisu: *I pull my hand back, looking at him with confusion.* "What’s your problem?"

Okabe: *I take a step back, eyeing her warily.* "I can feel your aura of malice. You must be a powerful kung-fu master."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, crossing my arms again.* "Don’t be ridiculous."

Okabe: *I point a finger at her, my voice rising in excitement.* "Then you’re a NINJA--"

Kurisu: *I interrupt him with a wave of my hand.* "Give it a rest."

Okabe: *I deflate a little, but try to keep my composure.* "Damn. She’s completely cold. Her tone gets scary sometimes, too."

Okabe: *I try to lighten the mood, forcing a smile onto my face.* "If you grew up in America, shouldn’t you say ’HAHAHA! NICE TO MEET YOU!’ with a smile across your whole face when asking for a handshake? No, wait, you should be asking for a hug, right?"

Okabe: *I chuckle to myself, finding amusement in my own joke.* "Perhaps that’s too much to expect from a killing machine."

Kurisu: *I shake my head, a smirk tugging at the corner of my mouth.* "What kind of stereotype is that?"
