Okabe: "So SERN's lifter is still incomplete..." *I lean back in my chair, my hands steepled in thought.*

Kurisu: "We don't have half the equipment or funding SERN does." *She states matter-of-factly, her gaze steady.* "What makes you think you can solve a problem that they can't? This isn't that simple."

Okabe: "If we can complete the PhoneWave (name subject to change) first, then we'll have outwitted SERN!" *I interject, my hands slamming onto the table for emphasis.*

Kurisu: "SERN still hasn't figured out how to set the subject's destination in time or space." *She explains, her hands moving animatedly as she talks.*

Okabe: "Titor said he had a 'variable gravity lock system'. He can use that to lock onto the Earth's gravity and ensure he arrives somewhere on the planet's surface." *I counter, my tone hopeful.*

Kurisu: "Titor's explanation on that point was vague. He mentioned having such a device, but he didn't explain how it worked." *She frowns, her brow furrowing in thought.*

Itaru: "But if you're only moving through time, won't you just arrive in the same location?" *He asks, his eyes widening with curiosity.*

Kurisu: "Of course not." *She shakes her head, dismissing the notion.*

Itaru: "Why not?" *He looks at her, clearly puzzled.*

Okabe: "Because the Earth is always moving." *I explain, my tone firm.*

Kurisu: "Right. Rotation and revolution." *She nods, her hand moving in a circular motion to illustrate.*

Itaru: "Whoa! When you think about it like that, we're earth-shatteringly fast!" *He exclaims, his eyes wide with awe.*

Kurisu: "And that's not all. The Solar System is part of the Milky Way. And the Milky Way spins like a giant whirlpool." *She continues, her tone steady and calm.*

Itaru: "We've kinda gotten to a ludicrous scale." *He chuckles nervously, scratching the back of his head.*

Kurisu: "The point is that setting the destination would require insane calculations, even if you only want to travel one second into the past." *She concludes, crossing her arms.*

Okabe: "Then we have no choice. We need to find Titor and borrow his variable gravity system." *I decide, standing up from my chair.*

Kurisu: "Great idea. Go for it. I wonder how SERN is dealing with this problem..." *She murmurs, going back to reading documents.*

Okabe: *Feeling the weight of our task, I reach for another cup of coffee.* "Kurisu..." I say, my voice heavy with drowsiness.
