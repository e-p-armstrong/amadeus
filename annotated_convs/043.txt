Mayuri: "I'll refresh the air!" *She moves to the window, swinging it open to reveal the morning sky.* 

Okabe: "Since all lab mems are present and accounted for, this is the perfect opportunity to hold another Round Table Conference." *I glance around the lab, my gaze landing on each member in turn.*

Mayuri: "Roundabout confluence?" *She tilts her head, confused by the unfamiliar term.*

Itaru: "...What's that?" *He raises an eyebrow in question.*

Okabe: "A meeting of lab mems." *I clarify, folding my arms across my chest.*

Itaru: "Have we ever done that before?" *He scratches his head, looking genuinely puzzled.*

Kurisu: "Do you even have a round table?" *She interrupts, her tone dry and somewhat amused.*

Okabe: "Not physically. However, it exists in the hearts of all lab mems. Am I mistaken?" *I question, looking at each of them in turn.*

Kurisu: "Yes, you're mistaken. Don't go sticking things in people's hearts." *She retorts, her arms crossed and eyes narrowed in disbelief.*

Mayuri: "Is there one in Mayushii too?" *She asks, her eyes wide with curiosity.*

Okabe: "Of course there is." *I assure her, offering a faint smile.*

Mayuri: "Oh, that's good. But what's a roundable?" *She inquires, her confusion evident.*

Itaru: "And why a round table? You King Arthur?" *He chuckles, leaning back in his chair.*

Kurisu: "I'm only a temporary lab mem anyway." *She shrugs, looking away with a sigh.*

Okabe: "Anyway, it's a Round Table Conference! Mayuri wasn't here last night, so first, let's explain the situation to her." *I announce, my tone growing serious as I begin to explain the gravity of the situation.*

Mayuri: "I told you you shouldn't do bad things." *She murmurs, her brows furrowing in concern.*

Okabe: "Hmph, 'bad' you say? We are bad? Absurd. If we're bad, then SERN is even worse." *I argue back passionately, slamming my fist on the table for emphasis.*

Kurisu: "I agree." *She nods, her eyes hard and determined.*

Okabe: "Anyway, Ragnarok can no longer be averted. The final battle with SERN is near." *I declare, my voice heavy with the weight of our situation.*

Mayuri: "Rag in a rock?" *She repeats, her eyes wide with confusion.*

Kurisu: "Norse mythology again?" *She shakes her head, rubbing her temples.*

Okabe: "Christina! I ordered you to investigate SERN! What have you learned?" *I turn to Kurisu, my gaze expectant.*

Kurisu: "I don't remember being ordered, but whatever." *She sighs, rolling her eyes before diving into her explanation.*

Mayuri: "Why can't they be found?" *She asks innocently, her eyes welling up with worry.*

Itaru: "Didn't you know, Mayu-shi? The world is constantly moving." *He starts to explain, his tone authoritative yet patient.*

Kurisu: "SERN has been looking for solutions, but it's not going well." *She concludes, her brow furrowed in concentration.*
