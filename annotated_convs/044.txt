Kurisu: "Hmm..." *She falls silent, staring at the ceiling in deep thought.* "Well, I suppose you could call the LHC the world's largest microwave oven."

Okabe: "Of course! In other words, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is a miniature LHC!" *My voice fills with excitement, my hands moving animatedly as I explain my theory.*

Kurisu: "You might be on to something there." *She admits, a small smile playing on her lips as she looks at me.*

Okabe: *Taken aback, I pause for a moment.* "However, there are too many things we don't know about the PhoneWave. Why do the same phenomena that occur in SERN's time machine also occur in that tiny little microwave? Unlike the LHC, this thing wasn't made for time travel."

Mayuri: "It was made to warm Mayushii's chicken!" *She interjects cheerily, completely oblivious to the seriousness of our conversation.*

Kurisu: "W-well, yeah." *She stammers, thrown off by Mayuri's comment.*

Okabe: "Since the jellyman phenomenon occurs with the PhoneWave (name subject to change), Mayuri's bananas must be reaching the Kerr black hole's ring singularity." *I turn to face Mayuri, my brows furrowed in concentration as I explain.*

Mayuri: "It makes a black hole? Here? It won't suck us in, will it?" *She asks wide-eyed, her chicken forgotten as she looks at us in alarm.*

Kurisu: "But we still haven't figured out the electric discharge phenomenon, or the conditions required to cause it." *She brings us back to the topic at hand, her gaze focused on the PhoneWave.*

Itaru: "During our experiments earlier, we were only able to send emails to the past during the discharge." *He adds, looking up from his computer.*

Okabe: "That's what we need to find out." *I nod at Kurisu, my gaze serious.*

Kurisu: "In the first place, the emails we're sending to the past are digital data, not physical objects. That's a definite difference from SERN's time machine." *She counters, crossing her arms as she looks at me.*

Okabe: "No, we're doing the same thing. Who's to say that digital data can't go through a singularity? I think it would be easier than sending something human-sized." *I argue, meeting her gaze.*

Kurisu: "Well... I suppose that's true." *She concedes, a thoughtful look on her face.*

Mayuri: "You know, the way you guys talk about email... It makes me think of folding a letter into a paper airplane and making it go zoom, you know?" *She says, her hands mimicking a plane flying through the air.*

Okabe: "It's more like a beam of light. Like optical digital data. By the way, it's a pain to keep saying 'email sent to the past'. Let's give it a proper name." *I propose, looking at everyone expectantly.*

Kurisu: "I've got a bad feeling about this." *She mutters, a wary look in her eyes.*

Okabe: "What's that supposed to mean? You dare mock Hououin Kyouma!?" *I protest, feigning outrage.*

Kurisu: "You just want to give it some oddball name, don't you?" *She accuses, raising an eyebrow at me.*

Okabe: "Fine! Then let's hear alternatives! Don't tell me you rejected my idea without having any bright ideas of your own!?" *I retort, crossing my arms in defiance.*

Kurisu: "I think it needs to be something easy to understand. It's an email that regresses through time, so how about Retromail?" *She suggests, looking at each of us for approval.*

Mayuri: "What does 'retro' mean?" *She asks, her brows furrowed in confusion.*

Okabe: "Sounds like you have your answer, Christina. You said it should be easy to understand, but it wasn't easy to understand at all, was it!?" *I tease, grinning at Kurisu triumphantly.*

Kurisu: "N-no!" *She protests, her cheeks turning a faint pink.*
