Okabe: *With a dramatic flourish of my arm and a maniacal laugh, I lay down my terms.* "Those are the conditions! If you can’t accept them, then you must leave at once! Heh heh heh. So what’ll it be? I don’t think it’s a bad deal at all."

Kurisu: *A skeptical eyebrow raised, I retort,* "You mean for you." *I place my fingers against my brow and shake my head in an exaggerated gesture, my frustration clear.*

Kurisu: *With a sigh of disbelief, I continue,* "Geez... I feel like I’m hypersecreting noradrenaline. Let me pick my jaw up off the floor."

Okabe: *In my typical dramatic manner, I dismiss her complaint.* "I don’t care about your dislocated jaw! Do you accept the conditions or not? Answer me, Christina!"

Kurisu: *I bristle at the nickname, my frustration growing.* "Stop adding -tina! My name’s Kurisu!"

Kurisu: *With a calming inhale, I look up at the ceiling, trying to calm my racing thoughts.* "...Okay. I accept."

Okabe: *A triumphant laugh escapes me.* "Hehehe, good answer. From this moment forth, you are Lab Mem Number 004. Welcome, Christina -- codename, The Zombie!"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, my tone firm.* "I won’t answer to either. Use my real name, Hououin."

Okabe: *We lock eyes, the tension palpable. Eventually, she looks away, her expression one of exasperation.* "You say something? Genius perv girl?"

Kurisu: *I throw my hands up in frustration.* "Come on! No more saying ’perv’! I won’t treat you like a perv either! So let’s drop it already!"

Okabe: *With a nod, I turn to our other lab member.* "As long as you understand. Now for the issue at hand. Daru, give Christina--"

Kurisu: *I interrupt him, my voice firm.* "No ’-tina’ either."

Okabe: *Unfazed, I continue,* "Give Kurisu-kun an explanation on our experiments so far."

Itaru: *With a shake of my head, I deny the request.* "But I refuse."

Okabe: *With a sigh, I take up the task of explaining the experiments, peppering in some of my 'heroic' deeds for good measure.*

Kurisu: *With a thoughtful nod, I acknowledge the explanation.* "Fascinating."

Okabe: *Leaning forward, I prompt her,* "Let’s hear your opinion."

Kurisu: *With a dismissive wave of my hand, I share my thoughts.* "I think we can at least throw out completely worthless theories like electromagnetic weaponry and teleportation."

Kurisu: *Without waiting for their approval, I grab an untouched banana and stick it in the microwave, my fingers flying over the keys of my phone.* "Can we run the experiment one more time? I want to see it for myself."

Okabe: *With a smirk, I question her authority.* "Who are you to give me orders? I am the mad scientist, Houou--"

Kurisu: *I cut him off, my focus on the experiment.* "Whatever. Just keep your eye on the bananas!"
