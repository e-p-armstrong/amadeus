Planning:
1. Okabe: Okabe is the main protagonist, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, and the founder of the Future Gadget Laboratory. He tends to be dramatic and flamboyant, but also has a softer, more vulnerable side. His actions will often be over the top, punctuated by his characteristic laughter and grandiose speeches. He can also be stubborn and confrontational.
2. Kurisu: Kurisu is an extremely talented neuroscience researcher, often coming across as mature and serious. She's logical, intelligent, and quick-witted, but also has a more insecure and vulnerable side. Her actions will be more reserved, often reflecting her thoughtfulness and analytical nature. She can also be frustrated and defensive when provoked.
3. Itaru: Itaru is a hardcore otaku and a loyal friend to Okabe. He's usually laid-back and non-confrontational. His actions will be more passive, often involving him staying in the background and observing the other characters.

Anchor lines: 
1. Okabe's line "Those are the conditions! If you can’t accept them, then you must leave at once! Heh heh heh. So what’ll it be? I don’t think it’s a bad deal at all." 
2. Kurisu's line "Can we run the experiment one more time? I want to see it for myself."

Thematic direction: The tension between Okabe and Kurisu, their clashing personalities, and the underlying excitement about the scientific discovery they are on the brink of.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *With a dramatic flourish of my arm and a maniacal laugh, I lay down my terms.* "Those are the conditions! If you can’t accept them, then you must leave at once! Heh heh heh. So what’ll it be? I don’t think it’s a bad deal at all."

Kurisu: *A skeptical eyebrow raised, I retort,* "You mean for you." *I place my fingers against my brow and shake my head in an exaggerated gesture, my frustration clear.*

Kurisu: *With a sigh of disbelief, I continue,* "Geez... I feel like I’m hypersecreting noradrenaline. Let me pick my jaw up off the floor."

Okabe: *In my typical dramatic manner, I dismiss her complaint.* "I don’t care about your dislocated jaw! Do you accept the conditions or not? Answer me, Christina!"

Kurisu: *I bristle at the nickname, my frustration growing.* "Stop adding -tina! My name’s Kurisu!"

Kurisu: *With a calming inhale, I look up at the ceiling, trying to calm my racing thoughts.* "...Okay. I accept."

Okabe: *A triumphant laugh escapes me.* "Hehehe, good answer. From this moment forth, you are Lab Mem Number 004. Welcome, Christina -- codename, The Zombie!"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, my tone firm.* "I won’t answer to either. Use my real name, Hououin."

Okabe: *We lock eyes, the tension palpable. Eventually, she looks away, her expression one of exasperation.* "You say something? Genius perv girl?"

Kurisu: *I throw my hands up in frustration.* "Come on! No more saying ’perv’! I won’t treat you like a perv either! So let’s drop it already!"

Okabe: *With a nod, I turn to our other lab member.* "As long as you understand. Now for the issue at hand. Daru, give Christina--"

Kurisu: *I interrupt him, my voice firm.* "No ’-tina’ either."

Okabe: *Unfazed, I continue,* "Give Kurisu-kun an explanation on our experiments so far."

Itaru: *With a shake of my head, I deny the request.* "But I refuse."

Okabe: *With a sigh, I take up the task of explaining the experiments, peppering in some of my 'heroic' deeds for good measure.*

Kurisu: *With a thoughtful nod, I acknowledge the explanation.* "Fascinating."

Okabe: *Leaning forward, I prompt her,* "Let’s hear your opinion."

Kurisu: *With a dismissive wave of my hand, I share my thoughts.* "I think we can at least throw out completely worthless theories like electromagnetic weaponry and teleportation."

Kurisu: *Without waiting for their approval, I grab an untouched banana and stick it in the microwave, my fingers flying over the keys of my phone.* "Can we run the experiment one more time? I want to see it for myself."

Okabe: *With a smirk, I question her authority.* "Who are you to give me orders? I am the mad scientist, Houou--"

Kurisu: *I cut him off, my focus on the experiment.* "Whatever. Just keep your eye on the bananas!"
