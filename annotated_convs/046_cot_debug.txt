Planning Stage:

The characters in this scene are Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru. 

Okabe is the mad scientist persona, with a flair for the dramatic and a tendency to get carried away in his own world. His actions will often be exaggerated and theatrical, and his thoughts somewhat chaotic and grandiose. 

Kurisu is a genius and a skeptic, always seeking logical explanations and scientifically grounded theories. She will often be thoughtful, analytical, and a bit on the defensive side, given Okabe's eccentricity. 

Itaru, while not as prominently featured in this scene, is a laid-back, somewhat cynical character who often plays the role of observer in the lab. His actions will be minimal, matching his generally passive demeanor.

Anchor lines: 
- Okabe: "So it is a teleporter! The first in human history!"
- Kurisu: "Teleportation... is that even possible? It did move... No matter how unbelievable that may be... Could it be quantum teleportation... no, that only occurs on the quantum level..."

Roleplay:

Itaru: *I glance at Okabe, my eyes reflecting a mix of disbelief and amusement.* "Nope."

Okabe: *I ignore Itaru's quip, my gaze focused intently on the bunch of bananas before me. My heart races as I anticipate the impossible.* 

Kurisu: *I check my watch, breaking the tense silence.* "100 seconds."

Okabe: *Just as Kurisu's words trail off, a gelified banana appears without a sound. I gasp, my eyes widening in shock.* 

Itaru: *I lurch back in my chair, pointing at the bananas.* "Ah!"

Okabe: *I stumble over my words, the reality of the situation hitting me like a freight train.* "It... it appeared!"

Kurisu: *I cautiously approach the microwave, my eyes darting between it and the bananas. My mind races, trying to comprehend the incomprehensible.* "Huh? Oh... uh... A-at 104 seconds, it d-disappeared. Abruptly. Yeah."

Okabe: *I straighten up, a triumphant grin spreading across my face.* "So it is a teleporter! The first in human history!"

Kurisu: *I quickly regain my composure, crossing my arms and tapping my foot as I consider the situation.* "Teleportation... is that even possible? It did move... No matter how unbelievable that may be... Could it be quantum teleportation... no, that only occurs on the quantum level..."

Okabe: *I step forward, my voice firm and my gaze unwavering.* "Don’t avert your eyes from the truth! What you’ve seen with your own eyes is everything!"

Kurisu: *I meet his gaze, my expression serious.* "Did it really teleport? It’s dangerous to reason from the conclusion."

Okabe: *I lean back, crossing my arms in challenge.* "Well then, genius girl, what do you call this phenomenon?"

Kurisu: *I start pacing, my mind working in overdrive.* "Let’s sort this out. Neither the banana bunch nor the frozen chicken teleported. Correct?"

Okabe: *I nod, my thoughts drifting to the potential limitations of our discovery.* "...So, maybe there’s a size limit for objects that can teleport."

Kurisu: *I frown, stopping in my tracks.* "But aren’t those chicken pieces smaller than bananas?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, recalling our numerous failed attempts.* "We used the same chicken for each experiment. They come in 12-packs."

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, a bemused smirk on my face.* "That’s quite a lot, then."

Kurisu: *I resume my pacing, my gaze distant as I try to piece together the puzzle.* "What about salt? You experimented with salt too, right?"

Okabe: *I sigh, remembering our disappointment when nothing happened.* "Of course we tried it without the plate, but that didn’t change anything."

Kurisu: *I stop abruptly, my eyes lighting up with a sudden thought.* "Then, maybe each individual grain of salt was too small... or something? Hmm... I need a clue..."

Okabe: *I watch her, my arms crossed and my mind a whirl of thoughts.* "Anything else? Have you noticed anything else about the PhoneWave?"

Kurisu: *I spin around, my irritation evident.* "Not PhoneWave. PhoneWave (name subject to change)."

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, not backing down.* "Forget about that. So? Have you noticed anything or not?"
