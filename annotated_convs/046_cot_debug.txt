Kurisu: "First, let's see if it'll become a jellyman. Agh!" *She exclaims, bending to check the machine, but clumsily, she bangs her head underneath the table.*

Okabe: "Trying for the clumsy girl appeal?" *I tease, watching her with a smug grin.*

Kurisu: "It was an accident!" *She protests, getting up quickly, her cheeks a rosy red.*

Mayuri: "Chris-chan, Chris-chan! Pain, pain, go awayâ™ª" *Mayuri coos, gently patting the back of Kurisu's head before sweeping her hand through the air.*

Kurisu: "Thanks, Mayuri-san." *She says, pulling herself together before typing on her phone and activating the PhoneWave (name subject to change).*

Okabe: *I watch as the banana inside the microwave slowly begins to spin backwards.* 

Kurisu: "Ah!" *She shouts suddenly, peering into the microwave in shock as the banana vanishes and reappears, now gelified.*

Itaru: "Whoa!" *He exclaims, leaning forward to get a better look at the transformed fruit.*

Mayuri: "It became a gelbana..." *She murmurs, her eyes wide in awe.*

Okabe: "Heh heh heh... muhahaha... MUHAHAHAHA! Just as I suspected, the critical variable was time!" *I boast, my laughter echoing in the small lab.*

Kurisu: "W-way to go, Okabe. It was so simple, I didn't notice it." *She says, her expression sulky as she watches me.*

Okabe: "Your praise does you credit, Christina, but I know you're frustrated you didn't think of it first. Muhahahaha!" *I laugh, relishing in the rare moment of triumph.*

Kurisu: "Anyway, let's see if we can send another D-Mail." *She says, brushing off my laughter as she excitedly starts typing out a mail.*

Okabe: "Guh... I feel like my authority has been on the decline since that girl showed up." *I grumble, watching as Kurisu takes charge.*

Itaru: "It's cool, man. You never had any to begin with." *He teases, leaning back in his chair with a smirk.*

Kurisu: "Help me, you two! Okabe, I'm sending an email to your phone." *She commands, not even looking up from her phone.*

Okabe: *I sigh, but do as she says, inserting my phone into the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s slot.*

Mayuri: "What are you gonna send, Chris-chan?" *She asks, pressing up against Kurisu to peek at her phone.*

Kurisu: "It doesn't matter what it says. What matters is whether we can send it or not." *She explains, her fingers flying over her phone's keyboard.*

Okabe: "Wait! You there, assistant! What are you typing?" *I ask, noticing the smirk on her face.*

Kurisu: "You'll see. Ready? I'm sending it." *She says, her finger hovering over the send button.*

Itaru: "Starting the countdown!" *He announces, eyeing the microwave's timer.*

Okabe: *As Kurisu presses send, I open the microwave door almost simultaneously, an excited grin spreading across my face.*

Kurisu: "Kya!" *She yelps as the room fills with the sound of crackling electricity and the floor starts creaking.*

Okabe: "MUHAHAHAHA! It's working! It's working, you guys!" *I roar with laughter, my eyes sparkling with excitement.*

Kurisu: "...Did it arrive?" *She asks, her voice barely audible over the hum of the machine.*
