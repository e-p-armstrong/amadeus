Plan/Thoughts/Brainstorming:

This scene is essentially a group conversation between Okabe, Itaru, and Kurisu. They are discussing a mysterious event that occurred with a device they've been working on, the 'PhoneWave'. Itaru is the tech expert, Kurisu the logical analyst, and Okabe the eccentric ideator. 

Okabe: Okabe is dramatic and flamboyant. His *actions* will be exaggerated, his thoughts filled with grandeur. He will interact with his environment, using it to punctuate his points. 

Itaru: Itaru, or Daru, is a laid-back character, an otaku and a tech genius. His *actions* will be more subdued and relaxed, often involving tech or snack food. His thought processes will be more technical and logical.

Kurisu: Kurisu is a serious and logical character. She's also a bit socially awkward, so her *actions* will be more reserved and her thoughts more analytical.

The anchor lines will be Okabe's "I get it... So that’s what happened." and "Silence! I’ve reached the answer, and now the world will tremble!" They will be the culmination of Okabe's dramatic realization process, and I will enhance them to show his eccentric personality, his grandiose ideas, and his excitement about the discovery.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I slam my palms on the table, my face twisted in shock.* "What!? I don’t know anything about that!"

Itaru: *I glance up from the computer screen, leaning back in my chair with a nonchalant shrug.* "That’s because you weren’t around when it happened."

Kurisu: *My eyebrows knit together in concentration, my gaze never leaving the PhoneWave.* "Discharge? How much?"

Itaru: *I chew thoughtfully on a Pocky stick, my eyes distant as I recall the event.* "It was like a fluorescent light lit up the development room. It lasted about two seconds, I guess."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, my mind racing to analyze the information.* "What were the circumstances?"

Itaru: *I chuckle, remembering the surprise of the incident.* "I was adjusting the cellphone attached to it. I unhooked it and put my own in. A little bit later, sparky sparky."

Okabe: *I snap my fingers, a new question forming in my mind.* "When was that?"

Itaru: *I tap my chin, trying to remember the exact time.* "Around noon yesterday. When you went to see Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation."

Kurisu: *I pause at the mention of the name, a hint of unease in my voice.* "Doctor Nakabachi..."

Okabe: *A memory surfaces, connecting dots in my mind.* "That’s right. I went to see Doctor Nakabachi’s conference yesterday. Come to think of it, he stole his time travel theory from John Titor. Maybe the current John Titor is actually Nakabachi."

Okabe: *I turn back to Daru, my brow furrowing in confusion.* "But wait, Daru. Didn’t you say that Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation was cancelled?"

Itaru: *I nod, pointing at Okabe with the Pocky stick.* "Yeah, but you went with Mayu-shi anyway, remember?"

Okabe: *My mind stumbles, the memory doesn't match up.* "...No, I don’t remember that. After all, Nakabachi’s presentation wasn’t canceled, the way I remember it. I still don’t understand why my memories seem to disagree with everyone else’s."

Okabe: *I remember something else, a key piece of evidence.* "That reminds me. I sent you an email back then. Did you get it?"

Itaru: *I tilt my head, trying to recall.* "An email?"

Kurisu: *I interject, my mind connecting the dots.* "That email you showed me at ATF yesterday?"

Okabe: *I nod, confirming Kurisu's suspicion.* "It said someone stabbed me at the presentation, didn’t it?"

Okabe: "Yeah. But for some reason, Daru’s phone received it a week ago..."

Itaru: *I frown, puzzled.* "Huh? Wasn’t that one of your stories? If it wasn’t, then that would make the timestamp weird."

Okabe: *I strike a dramatic pose, pointing at Daru accusingly.* "I always speak the truth! If you don’t trust me, I’ll show you my send history."

Okabe: *I whip out my phone, scrolling through the history.* But no matter how many times I check, there’s no record of it. It should be there, but it isn’t. Just like the banana inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change).

Okabe: *I stare at the empty screen, my voice filled with confusion.* "It’s gone..."

Okabe: *I shake my head, the memory clear as day.* "Where did it go? I could’ve sworn I sent it just before 1 PM."

Itaru: *I remember, my eyes widening.* "Oh yeah! That’s when the discharge phenomenon happened! The show I was watching was about to end."

Okabe: *A flash of inspiration strikes me, a sudden realization.* "I get it... So that’s what happened."

Kurisu: *I look at Okabe, my confusion evident.* "Uh, what?"

Itaru: *I wave a hand dismissively, used to Okabe's theatrics.* "Oh, this is one of Okarin’s usual habits, so don’t mind it. Seriously."

Okabe: *I rise from my chair, my voice booming, my eyes sparkling with the thrill of discovery.* "Silence! I’ve reached the answer, and now the world will tremble!"
