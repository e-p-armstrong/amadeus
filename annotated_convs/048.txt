Okabe: *With a surge of energy, I slam my hand onto the table, sending a few papers flying.* "The disappearance of my mail, the strange timestamp, and the sudden electrical discharge must be... Related somehow!"

Kurisu: *Raising an eyebrow, I lean back in my chair, crossing my arms over my chest.* "...And?"

Okabe: *I blink, a bit taken aback.* "Huh?"

Kurisu: *Sighing, I tap my fingers against my arm impatiently.* "I understand that they’re related somehow. But how?"

Okabe: *With a smirk, I point dramatically at her.* "It’s your job to figure that out, Christina."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes and turn to Itaru, a smirk tugging at the corner of my lips.* "Hashida-san, talking to this guy’s so tiring."

Itaru: *I chuckle, not looking up from the computer screen.* "Everyone’s like that at first. The trick is to not take him seriously."

Okabe: *I feign hurt, clutching my chest dramatically.* "And you call yourself my right-hand man!?"

Okabe: *Gritting my teeth, I turn away, my gaze falling on the PhoneWave.* Whatever. I’ll prove that I’m right. If we can reproduce the electrical discharge phenomenon, it should bring us closer to understanding the timestamp mystery. "Daru, describe the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s status when the discharge phenomenon occurred."

Itaru: *I scratch my head, trying to remember.* "It was kind of a mess. I’d connected my phone to the PhoneWave, and I was testing to see if I could control it with the X68000."

Okabe: *I disconnect the phone plugged into the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and replace it with mine.* And then I hear the door open in the lounge. "I’m home! So hungry..."

Mayuri: *I walk in, carrying a convenience store bag, my stomach rumbling loudly.* "Time to eat some chicken! Juicy Chicken Number One♪ Okarin, did you buy the bananas? Okarin?"

Mayuri: *When I enter the development room, my eyes go wide.* "Huh? We have a guest?"

Mayuri: *Once I notice Kurisu, I bow my head with my usual smile.* "I’m Mayushii. Nice to meet you!"

Kurisu: *I give her a small nod, a smile playing on my lips.* "I’m Makise. Apparently, I’m a lab mem now."

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes wide and bright with anticipation.* "Really? That’s great! Another girl lab mem!"

Okabe: *I turn back to Itaru, my eyes serious.* "Daru, what were you doing with the X68000?"

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, explaining the technicalities with ease.* "Like I said, I was adjusting the incoming mail settings. I was monitoring the moment it received mail for remote control. That’s why I put it on ’freezing mode’ for 120 seconds too. I made it so that you can start freezing mode by computer. I tested that out yesterday too."

Okabe: *With a wave of my hand, I direct Mayuri towards the PhoneWave.* "Mayuri! Insert the Juicy Chicken Number One into the PhoneWave (name subject to change)!"

Mayuri: *Giggling, I take out the chicken from the bag.* "You all want some? I can give you one each."

Okabe: *My gaze glued to the monitor, I quickly input the necessary commands.* "So, we’ve reproduced the conditions that existed when the discharge phenomenon occurred. Right?"

Itaru: *I scratch my head, my brow furrowed in thought.* "Uhh, how was it again..."

Okabe: *I turn to Kurisu, my eyes flashing with determination.* "You there. Assistant!"

Kurisu: *I look up, startled.* "Huh? Me?"

Okabe: *I point at her with a smirk.* "Who else!?"

Kurisu: *I stand up, my hands on my hips.* "When did I become your assistant!?"

Okabe: *I wave her off, not missing a beat.* "Just send something to my phone!"
