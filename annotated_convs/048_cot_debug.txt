Tennouji: "The ceiling is falling, you dumbass! Some got into my ramen! What are you gonna do about it, huh!? No more shaking! Or I'll raise your rent by 10, 000!" *He glares at me.*

Okabe: *I gulp, realizing the seriousness of the situation.* "Leave it to me, Mister Braun! On my honor, I swear there won't be any more shaking today!" *I promise, before racing out of his workshop.*

Okabe: "Christina! Stop the experiments at once!" *I burst into the lab, my heart pounding.*

Mayuri: "Sorry, Okarin. Mayushii tried to warm up some chicken. I accidentally put it through reverse rotation, and then it started sparking." *She explains, looking a bit guilty.*

Okabe: "...I see." *I sigh, looking over the scene. Mayuri with her chicken, Daru with his boxed lunch, and Kurisu with her cup noodles.*

Kurisu: "I sent you an email. Didn't you get it?" *She asks, her fork poised above her cup noodles.*

Okabe: "Stop screwing around! I'm the one who has to deal with Mister Braun!" *I retort, disconnecting my phone from the PhoneWave (name subject to change) with a frown.*

Kurisu: "But I gave you five days advance notice." *She says, shrugging nonchalantly.*

Itaru: "Was he mad?" *He asks, turning pale at the thought of Tennouji's wrath.*

Okabe: "Yeah... I could feel his Killing Aura." *I admit, looking a bit shaken.*

Okabe: "Anyway, no more experiments today." *I declare, trying to regain some control over the situation.*

Kurisu: "Well, at least we got some good data." *She yawns, covering her mouth with her hand.*

Okabe: *I toss my cold lunch into the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and set the timer.* "I'd be lying if I called it clean. This entire building is in shambles."

Kurisu: "Anyway, I refuse to use the same shower as Okabe." *She says, finishing her noodles and standing up.*

Okabe: "I understand. Nobody will blame you if you don't use it. Of course, since the three of us stayed up all night, we're all pretty smelly. Heh heh heh." *I chuckle, grabbing a fresh bottle of Dr P from the fridge.*

Kurisu: "That's why I'm going back to my hotel once I finish eating." *She states, picking up her belongings.*

Okabe: "Celebrity bath time at a high class hotel? I want to come too." *I tease, opening my soda.*

Kurisu: "Not a chance." *She shoots back, heading towards the door.*

Mayuri: "Mayushii wants to come too!" *She chimes in, her eyes sparkling.*

Kurisu: "You can come any time, Mayuri-san." *She replies with a smile, before exiting the lab.*

Mayuri: "Hey, Okarin, I've been wondering, but why do you drink soda while you eat? Does it make it taste better?" *She asks, looking at me curiously.*

Okabe: "I don't really see a problem." *I reply, taking a bite of my warm lunch.*

Itaru: "Me neither." *He agrees, opening his own soda.*

Kurisu: "Same. I didn't give it a second thought." *She calls from the doorway, before leaving.*
