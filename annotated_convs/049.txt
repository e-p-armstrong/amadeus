Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, raising an eyebrow.* "I don’t even know your email address."

Okabe: *I scoff, waving my hand dismissively.* "What a useless assistant."

Kurisu: *I clench my fists, gritting my teeth.* "Don’t call me your assistant!"

Okabe: *Ignoring Kurisu's irritation, I turn to Daru.* "Daru, send an email from your phone!"

Itaru: *I look up from my laptop, blinking in confusion.* "Uh, sure... but what?"

Okabe: *I shrug, a smirk spreading across my face.* "Anything!"

Itaru: *I scratch the back of my head, uncertainty in my eyes.* "Uhh, umm..."

Okabe: *A wicked grin tugs at the corners of my mouth.* "Send ’Christina’s a perv’!"

Kurisu: *My cheeks flush, my eyes flashing with anger.* "I thought we agreed to stop saying that!"

Itaru: *I chuckle, my fingers hovering over my phone's keyboard.* "Well, let’s compromise and go with ’Okarin’s a perv’."

Okabe: *I gasp, feigning shock.* "You traitor!"

Kurisu: *I smirk, giving Daru a thumbs up.* "Good job, Hashida-san!"

Mayuri: *Suddenly, I rush into the room, my eyes wide with dismay.* "Oh no! Mayushii’s bananas!"

Okabe: *I glance at Mayuri, a sense of dread creeping over me. I knew this would happen eventually.* "It sounds like Mayuri has found the results of our latest experiment."

Mayuri: *I hold up a banana, now a gooey, green mess.* "They became gelbanas..."

Kurisu: *I shrug, trying to hide a smirk.* "We experimented on them."

Mayuri: *My bottom lip quivers, my eyes welling up with tears.* "But they were Mayushii’s..."

Itaru: *I glance between Mayuri and the others, my fingers still poised over my phone.* "Want me to send the mail now?"

Kurisu: *I nod, a mischievous glint in my eyes.* "You’ll be reimbursed later. By Hououin-san, that is."

Okabe: *I gape at Kurisu, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Why me!?"

Mayuri: *I pout, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Geez! Why do you always have to experiment on Mayushii’s food? Ah! Don’t tell me you’re experimenting on the chicken too?"

Okabe: *I avoid Mayuri's gaze, scratching the back of my head.* "We are."

Itaru: *I stifle a laugh, my fingers finally moving on the phone's keyboard.* "’Kay, sending it now. Sending, sending, click."

Okabe: *My heart drops as I see Mayuri approaching the PhoneWave. She reaches for the handle--* "Wait! Don’t open that!"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, confusion in my eyes.* "Huh?"

Okabe: *But it's too late. A blinding light fills the room, my heart pounding in my chest.* "The heart of a storm has nothing on this..."

Mayuri: *I scream, my hands flying up to cover my face.* "Wawah!"

Kurisu: *I stumble back, shielding my eyes with my arm.* "An electrical discharge!"

Okabe: *I grab Mayuri, pulling her away from the PhoneWave. My heart is a wild drum in my chest. I can hear Kurisu and Daru coughing in the background.* "E-everyone okay?"

Itaru: *I cough, my eyes stinging.* "S-somehow."

Kurisu: *I gasp, trying to catch my breath.* "That was definitely more than two seconds."

Mayuri: *I cling to Okabe, my body trembling.* "O-Okarin? Umm, what just happened?"

Okabe: *I gently release Mayuri, my heart still pounding.* "Are you okay? No burns or anything?"

Mayuri: *I blink up at Okabe, confusion in my eyes.* "Hmm... It doesn’t hurt anywhere, so I think I’m okay..."

Okabe: *I let out a sigh of relief, wiping the sweat off my brow.* "Looks like covering Mayuri was the right choice. I may be an insane mad scientist, but I still risk life and limb for the safety of my comrades."

Kurisu: *I point towards the PhoneWave, my eyes wide with surprise.* "H-hey! Look at this!"
