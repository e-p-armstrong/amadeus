Kurisu: *I frown, my fingers tapping on my chin as I analyze the current situation.* "This can’t be caused by electrical discharge. Some other phenomenon?"

Okabe: *I shake off my surprise, gripping my lab coat to steady myself.* "Heh... heh heh heh... MUHAHAHA! Just as my calculations predicted!" *I stretch out my hand to grab my phone, but find it still connected to the PhoneWave. I resign to whispering my catchphrase, feeling a sense of calm wash over me.*

Itaru: *I push up my glasses, looking towards Mayuri.* "...So, about Mayu-shi’s chicken."

Mayuri: *I blink, surprised.* "Eh?" *Rising from my seat, I peer into the PhoneWave, prying the door open with some effort.*

Mayuri: *I gasp, stepping back in shock.* "Ahh! M-Mayushii’s chicken is all burnt black..."

Okabe: *I reach out, giving Mayuri a reassuring pat on her shoulder.* "Juicy Chicken Number One made a noble sacrifice for the progress of science. Let us pray for his happiness in the next life."

Kurisu: *I wave my hands dismissively, urgency creeping into my voice.* "The chicken doesn’t matter! Right now, we need to determine what happened with the Phonewa--"

Mayuri: *I pout, my eyes welling up with tears.* "It doesn’t matter? That’s so mean, uh, Christina-chan..."

Kurisu: *I groan, pinching the bridge of my nose in frustration.* "Hey, Hououin Kyouma! Do something about this! Mayushii-san learned my name wrong!"

Itaru: *I cough, waving away the smoke.* "More importantly, we need ventilation. *cough cough*"

Okabe: *I slam my hand onto the table, silencing everyone.* "Silence, all of you!" *I disconnect my phone from the PhoneWave, checking my email list. My heart pounds in anticipation as I scroll through the emails, my breath hitching as I find the email I was looking for.*

Okabe: *I throw my head back, laughing maniacally.* "Muhaha! Muhahaha! MUHAHAHAHA!" *I clutch my phone, looking at the timestamp. I can't help but feel a wave of triumph wash over me.* "It all connects. There’s a meaning behind this series of events, and only one true answer. I’ve discovered the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s true hidden function! This isn’t intuition. That’s right. This is conviction!"
