**Plan/Thoughts/Brainstorming:**

**Character Archetypes/Personalities:**
1. Kurisu Makise: She is a genius girl who has a deep-rooted insecurity from her childhood. She is a tsundere and has a sharp tongue. She can be quite stubborn.
2. Okabe Rintarou (Hououin Kyouma): He is a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He is often seen as delusional and paranoid, frequently referring to the "Organization" that is after him. He often plays the fool and is eccentric, but he is also quite intelligent and serious when he needs to be.
3. Itaru Hashida (Daru): He is Okabe's best friend, and a talented hacker. He is a hardcore otaku, and often references this through his speech. He is laid-back and rarely loses his cool.
4. Mayuri Shiina (Mayushii): She is Okabe's childhood friend and is extremely kind and caring. She is often air-headed and has a unique sense of imagination.

**Writing Styles and Word Choices:**
1. Kurisu: Her speech and actions will be direct and somewhat curt. She will use scientific language and her actions will be precise and calculated.
2. Okabe: His speech will be grandiose and over-the-top, typical of his 'mad scientist' persona. His actions will be dramatic and exaggerated.
3. Daru: His speech will be relaxed, often interspersed with otaku lingo. His actions will be casual and laid-back.
4. Mayuri: Her speech will be soft and kind, often childlike. Her actions will be gentle and delicate.

**Anchors and Thematic Direction:**
1. Okabe's lines where he unveils the hidden function of the PhoneWave will be the main anchor. It will be infused with a sense of revelation and triumph.
2. The second anchor will be Mayuri's line about the burnt chicken, bringing a touch of light-heartedness and innocence to the scene.

**Roleplay:**

Kurisu: *I frown, my fingers tapping on my chin as I analyze the current situation.* "This can’t be caused by electrical discharge. Some other phenomenon?"

Okabe: *I shake off my surprise, gripping my lab coat to steady myself.* "Heh... heh heh heh... MUHAHAHA! Just as my calculations predicted!" *I stretch out my hand to grab my phone, but find it still connected to the PhoneWave. I resign to whispering my catchphrase, feeling a sense of calm wash over me.*

Itaru: *I push up my glasses, looking towards Mayuri.* "...So, about Mayu-shi’s chicken."

Mayuri: *I blink, surprised.* "Eh?" *Rising from my seat, I peer into the PhoneWave, prying the door open with some effort.*

Mayuri: *I gasp, stepping back in shock.* "Ahh! M-Mayushii’s chicken is all burnt black..."

Okabe: *I reach out, giving Mayuri a reassuring pat on her shoulder.* "Juicy Chicken Number One made a noble sacrifice for the progress of science. Let us pray for his happiness in the next life."

Kurisu: *I wave my hands dismissively, urgency creeping into my voice.* "The chicken doesn’t matter! Right now, we need to determine what happened with the Phonewa--"

Mayuri: *I pout, my eyes welling up with tears.* "It doesn’t matter? That’s so mean, uh, Christina-chan..."

Kurisu: *I groan, pinching the bridge of my nose in frustration.* "Hey, Hououin Kyouma! Do something about this! Mayushii-san learned my name wrong!"

Itaru: *I cough, waving away the smoke.* "More importantly, we need ventilation. *cough cough*"

Okabe: *I slam my hand onto the table, silencing everyone.* "Silence, all of you!" *I disconnect my phone from the PhoneWave, checking my email list. My heart pounds in anticipation as I scroll through the emails, my breath hitching as I find the email I was looking for.*

Okabe: *I throw my head back, laughing maniacally.* "Muhaha! Muhahaha! MUHAHAHAHA!" *I clutch my phone, looking at the timestamp. I can't help but feel a wave of triumph wash over me.* "It all connects. There’s a meaning behind this series of events, and only one true answer. I’ve discovered the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s true hidden function! This isn’t intuition. That’s right. This is conviction!"
