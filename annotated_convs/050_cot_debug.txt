Okabe: "Since each grain of salt is tiny, it's possible they could be converted to less than 12 bytes." *I say, waving my hands as if trying to visualize the concept.*

Kurisu: "So larger masses get crushed by supergravity?" *She rubs her chin, deep in thought.*

Okabe: "Mass might not be the issue here. Data doesn't have mass." *I retort, pointing at the PhoneWave for emphasis.*

Kurisu: "In any case, since the singularity isn't naked, the object is forced to pass through the event horizon. Inside the event horizon, space and time switch places, causing the subject that arrived at the ring singularity to reach ultra high speed... The data, crushed and destroyed by super gravity, is shot out of the black hole..." *She explains, her hands moving as she talks, almost as if she's painting the process in the air.*

Okabe: "As a jellyman." *I interject, completing her sentence with a smirk.*

Kurisu: "But even a small mass has to pass through supergravity. How does it emerge unscathed?" *She asks, looking at me, her eyebrows furrowed in challenge.*

Okabe: "If the hole is too tight, then just inject more electrons." *I suggest with a shrug.*

Kurisu: "I don't think it's that simple. I mean, I'm sure SERN's tried that already. And yet they haven't gotten any results after nine years of experiments. It's not as simple as increasing the flow of electrons." *She counters, crossing her arms over her chest.*

Okabe: "I see..." *I nod, taking in her words.*

Kurisu: "SERN has a lifter, but we don't know what in the PhoneWave is filling the same role, much less how to adjust it." *She continues, leaning forward, her focus unwavering.*

Okabe: "We don't know what acts as the lifter... But we do know that it has successfully created a path wide enough to send approximately 36 bytes of data through the ring singularity." *I respond, matching her intensity.*

Mayuri: "I don't get it..." *She interjects, her voice filled with confusion.*

Okabe: "Think of it like an RPG. The ring singularity, the entrance to the event horizon, is the gate to the Demon Lord's castle." *I explain, simplifying the concept for her.*

Kurisu: "D-demon Lord...?" *She stammers, taken aback by my sudden shift to fantasy.*

Mayuri: "So the soldiers who went home as slimes are jellymen?" *She asks, her eyes sparkling with understanding.*

Okabe: "But there's an exception." *I add, holding a finger up.*

Itaru: "Combining soldiers? That's just silly." *He comments, shaking his head and chuckling.*

Okabe: "It's to illustrate that the object can't be too big." *I explain, shrugging at his comment.*

Mayuri: "I get it! That's really easy to understand." *She exclaims, clapping her hands together.*

Kurisu: "It is?" *She asks, blinking in surprise.*

Itaru: "It's a dumb metaphor, but I guess it works? At least as an explanation for why things get gelified." *He says, scratching his head.*

Okabe: "Heh. It's all thanks to Mayuri's hint." *I give her a grateful smile.*

Mayuri: "Mayushii was helpful?" *She beams, her eyes sparkling with delight.*

Okabe: "Yeah. Great insight, Mayuri." *I give her a thumbs up.*

Mayuri: "Ehehe! Yay!" *She giggles, her face lighting up.*

Kurisu: "But it's still a hypothesis. It hasn't been proven." *She interrupts, bringing us back to reality.*

Itaru: "How would you prove it? With human experiments like SERN?" *He asks, a mischievous glint in his eyes.*

Kurisu: "If Okabe and Hashida-san volunteer as test subjects, I'll happily experiment on you." *She retorts, smirking at us.*

Itaru: "Human experimentation sounds kinda dirty. If you know what I mean. But I refuse. I'd rather play the doctor than the subject." *He chuckles, a teasing grin on his face.*

Okabe: "Same here. No, not in the way he's implying." *I add quickly, raising my hands in defense.*

Kurisu: "Idiots." *She mutters, rolling her eyes at our antics.*

Kurisu: "As I keep saying, the real problem is what the PhoneWave uses as a lifter." *She says, redirecting the conversation.*

Okabe: "That and one other thing. How come the discharge phenomenon and gelification only happen during a certain timeframe?" *I ask, leaning back in my chair.*

Itaru: "We may not understand everything, but we've perfected the art of D-Mailing. Isn't that our Final Answer?" *He asks, looking between us.*

Mayuri: "Sending mail to the past is amazing, isn't it?" *She chimes in, her eyes wide with wonder.*

Itaru: "Though I guess it's not a real time machine unless we can send people to the past." *He adds, chuckling to himself.*

Kurisu: "Even SERN has failed to send humans through. If you believe what Titor says, it won't be another, what, 24 years before there's a true time machine?" *She says, crossing her arms and leaning back.*

Okabe: "Physical time travel is impossible for us at the moment. We lack the funds and facilities available to SERN. And yet we have realized a form of time travel. We've sent data to the past." *I respond, my voice filled with a sense of accomplishment.*

Kurisu: "We should investigate the PhoneWave further. We need to understand what's going on." *She concludes, looking at us with a determined expression.*
