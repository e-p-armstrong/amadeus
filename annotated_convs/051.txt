Okabe: *I feel my lips twist into a grin, an irresistible force in the face of her skepticism.* "First, let me say one thing. The greatest inventions are created by accident. This we call serendipity."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes at his theatrics, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Get on with it."

Okabe: *I sigh dramatically, a little disappointed that she's not playing along, but no matter. My excitement is undeterred.* "The mail was sent to the past. The chicken returned to its frozen state. The plucked banana returned to the bunch."

Kurisu: *I blink at him, my mouth opening slightly in shock.* "...No way."

Okabe: *I nod eagerly, a triumphant smile spreading across my face as I witness her comprehension.* "Yes way!"

Okabe: *I raise my hand dramatically, pointing up at the ceiling as if I can touch the very fabric of time itself.* "The PhoneWave (name subject to change)... Is a time machine!"

Okabe: *The room is quiet, save for the humming of the electric fan and the clicking of Daru's mouse. The bright summer sun shines through the window, but the air in the lab feels stale. Despite the heat, a chill runs down my spine as I remember yesterday's shocking experiment. My hands shake slightly, my heart pounds in my chest, and the taste of Dr P lingers on my tongue. I'm exhausted, but there's no time for rest. Not now. Not when we've made such a monumental discovery.*

Kurisu: *I feel my heart hammering in my chest, my mind racing. It can't be true. It can't be. But the evidence...* "A time machine? A time machine!? It canâ€™t be!!" *I shout, my voice echoing in the silent lab. The reality of the situation is overwhelming, and for a moment, I can't hold back the tidal wave of emotions threatening to drown me.*
