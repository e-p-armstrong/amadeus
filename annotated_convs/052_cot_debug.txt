Planning:

Characters involved:
- Itaru "Daru" Hashida: Daru is a hardcore otaku, with interests in anime, manga, and gaming. He is an expert hacker and a key member of the Future Gadget Laboratory. He's also known for his perverted tendencies and his lack of motivation for anything outside his interests.
- Rintarou Okabe: Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist and the protagonist of the series. He is eccentric, often taking on the persona of a mad scientist named Hououin Kyouma, and has a deep-seated fear of the organization known as SERN.

Writing styles and word choices:
- Daru: His actions will reflect his laid-back, otaku lifestyle. His language will be casual, with some slang and internet jargon.
- Okabe: His actions will be more animated and dramatic to reflect his mad scientist persona. His language will be more formal and filled with scientific terms. His thoughts will reveal his paranoia and his analytical nature.

Anchors:
1. Daru's comment about the Large Hadron Collider - Here, I will depict Daru's fascination with technology and Okabe's confusion and curiosity.
2. Okabe's line about SERN's time machine - This will be the climax of the scene, where Okabe reveals the prediction about SERN's time machine. 

Roleplay:

Itaru: *I shrug nonchalantly, not even bothering to look up from my computer screen.* "Nah, too much trouble..."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow at Daru's dismissive attitude.* "Aren’t you hungry?"

Itaru: *I rub my stomach absentmindedly, grumbling under my breath.* "Yeah, but..."

Okabe: *I cross my arms, shaking my head in mild exasperation.* "Hmph. You’re such a bum."

Okabe: *Curiosity piqued, I casually saunter over to Daru's desk, craning my neck to peek over his shoulder at his screen. A futuristic-looking facility fills the monitor, an array of richly-colored cords snaking through a gigantic octagonal tunnel. The sight is reminiscent of a sci-fi spaceship interior. Judging from the height of the people in the picture, the tunnel must be over ten meters tall. The people in the image, I note, don't look Japanese.*

Itaru: *I let out a hearty sigh, leaning back in my chair.* "Haa..."

Okabe: *I frown, studying Daru's face. His eyes are blank, but I can't tell if it's due to sleepiness, exhaustion, or something else entirely.*

Itaru: *I absentmindedly click on the image, zooming in on the intricate design.* "The Large Hadron Collider sure is cute..."

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat as I whirl around to face Daru, eyes wide with shock.* "W-what!? What did you just say!?"

Okabe: *My mind races, thoughts whirling. Large Hardon Colliander? Is that some sort of incantation? Or perhaps a secret technique?*

Itaru: *I glance up at Okabe, smirking.* "Large Hadron Collider. You don’t know about it?"

Okabe: *I reach out to grab Daru's shoulders, my fingers digging into his flesh as I shake him vigorously.* "Owowowowowow, what are you doing!?"

Itaru: *I grimace, trying to pull away from Okabe's grip.* "Are you conscious?"

Itaru: *I nod, rubbing my sore shoulders.* "Of course, man."

Okabe: *I release him, taking a step back.* "What is this Large Hadron Collider thing?"

Itaru: *I turn back to my screen, pointing at the image.* "You know. It’s what SERN uses to do their experiments. LHC for short. It’s seriously moe. Recommended."

Okabe: *I furrow my brows, struggling to process Daru's words.* "You’re lusting for something that’s not even humanoid?"

Itaru: *I shrug, a smirk playing on my lips.* "Of course not. But there’s something about it that gets me excited, you know? It makes me smile, you know? Don’t you feel that?"

Okabe: *I recall a previous conversation, a faint memory resurfacing.* "Come to think of it, I remember you said that you found factories and the undersides of highways irresistible or something."

Itaru: *I nod enthusiastically, my eyes gleaming with excitement.* "Yeah. Same thing."

Okabe: *I let out a sigh, pinching the bridge of my nose.* "Where does it end?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, struggling to comprehend Daru's endless list of interests. 2D, 3D, and now even inanimate objects...*

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, grinning.* "Life’s too short. I don’t want to limit my interests, you know?"

Okabe: *I scoff, rolling my eyes. Daru's hypocrisy is almost laughable. He would do anything to avoid things that don’t interest him.*

Okabe: *My mind latches onto a familiar name.* "SERN..."

Okabe: *A memory sparks, sending a jolt of realization through me. I've seen that name somewhere, and recently. Of course, it was...* "John Titor!"

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, clearly confused.* "Oh yeah. That guy you mentioned earlier. He’s the guy @channel’s going crazy about, isn’t he?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, correcting him.* "That one might be an impostor. I was talking about the John Titor who appeared ten years ago."

Itaru: *I blink in surprise.* "He appeared ten years ago? The same guy?"

Okabe: *I let out a sigh of disappointment. I had hoped that Daru would remember, but it seems I'm out of luck.*

Okabe: *Determined, I press on.* "Anyway, John Titor mentioned SERN."

Okabe: *I rack my brain, trying to recall Titor's exact words. I may not remember everything, but there's one thing I'm certain of.*

Okabe: *I lean in closer, lowering my voice for dramatic effect.* "Titor made a prediction. Namely, that before the year 2034, SERN will develop a time machine!"

Itaru: *I chuckle, shaking my head.* "A time machine? That’s a timely topic. But that wasn’t just ten years ago. This new Titor said the same thing."

Okabe: *I wave off Daru's comment, my gaze unwavering.* "It doesn’t matter if it was ten years ago or ten seconds ago. That’s not the point, Daru. This coincidence could very well be the choice of Steins Gate!"
