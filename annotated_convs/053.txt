 

Okabe: "Aren't you working today?" *I ask, looking at Suzuha as she polishes her bicycle in the corner of the lab.*

Suzuha: "Of course I am. Why else would I be here?" *She replies, not looking up from her task.*

Kurisu: "What, is she still tinkering with that bike of hers?" *Her voice floats from the other side of the lab, tinged with a hint of annoyance.* 

Okabe: "Hey, Part-Time Warrior! Where's Mister Braun?" *I call out, purposely ignoring Kurisu's question.*

Suzuha: "Mister Braun? Who's that?" *She looks up, her face showing genuine confusion.*

Okabe: "The manager of that junk shop you work at." *I retort, a smirk tugging at the corner of my mouth.*

Kurisu: "It's not a junk shop. It's a CRT specialty shop." *She chimes in, correcting me with a huff.*

Suzuha: "Oh, so that's who you meant. Ahaha." *She laughs, finally catching on to my teasing.*

Nae: "Daddy's name isn't Mister Braun." *She pipes up from the corner, her small voice filled with a certain determination.*

Suzuha: "The boss is on a service trip! I don't think he'll be back for a while!" *She announces, grinning mischievously.*

Okabe: "Wh-what!? Is that true!?" *I exclaim, turning to her with wide eyes.*

Suzuha: "It's true! I wouldn't be slacking off like this otherwise! Ah, Nae, don't tell the boss I said that, okay?" *She quickly adds, sharing a secret wink with Nae.*

Okabe: "You heard her. This must be the choice of Steins Gate. Mister Braun is currently absent. In other words, we can experiment to our heart's content!" *I declare, turning back to the rest of the group with a triumphant grin.*

Kurisu: "That doesn't solve the problem, you know." *She retorts, crossing her arms over her chest.*

Okabe: "I'm telling you, it's the choice of Steins Gate." *I insist, returning her defiant stare.*

Itaru: "Whatever. I want to try out the PhoneWave 2nd Edition v1. 03." *He murmurs, already engrossed in his laptop.*

Okabe: "Enough of your unsophisticated names. The upgraded version shall be known as Heavenly Merry-Go-Round." *I declare, waving my hand dramatically.*

Kurisu: "The name doesn't matter. Let's just start the experi--" *Her words are cut off by the sound of a camera shutter. She turns abruptly towards the source of the sound, her eyes narrowing.*

Moeka: "...You looked like you were having fun." *She says quietly, looking down at her phone.*

Kurisu: "Hardly. I'm fed up with these people and their fooling around." *She huffs, turning away from the group.*

Itaru: "This assistant is such a tsundere." *He teases, looking up from his laptop with a cheeky grin.*

Kurisu: "Who are you calling a tsundere!?" *She snaps, her face flushing.*

Itaru: "Oh? Makise-shi, you know what tsundere means?" *He asks, leaning back in his chair with a smirk.*

Kurisu: "...N-no." *She stammers, looking away.*

Okabe: "I think you do. It's written all over your face." *I tease, a triumphant grin spreading across my face.*

Kurisu: "Mmmgh..." *She grumbles, crossing her arms over her chest again.*
