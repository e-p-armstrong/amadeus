Moeka: *She continues to stare at my phone, lost in her own thoughts.*

Suzuha: "Hey!" *Her voice rings out from the window, and I glance over to see her peering in.* "It's shaking again! And there's a strange light, too! What are you doing up there!?"

Okabe: *I roll my eyes and turn my back to the window, deciding to ignore her intrusion.* "Now then, lab mems." *I gesture to the others, my voice taking on a serious tone.* "The 73rd Round Table Conference will come to order."

Kurisu: "Yesterday was the 66th. Where'd the other six go?" *She retorts, crossing her arms and raising an eyebrow at me.*

Okabe: "Only anal retentive bastards care about the minor details." *I wave my hand dismissively, a smirk on my face.* "That's why you'll never be more than an assistant, Christina!"

Kurisu: "Like I keep saying, I'm neither your assistant nor Christina." *She responds, her voice firm and her gaze steady on me.*
