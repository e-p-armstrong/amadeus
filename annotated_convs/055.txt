Okabe: *Engrossed in a fiery online debate, I barely notice the door creak open and a familiar face peek in.* "I recognize her. She's the girl I met yesterday at the Braun Tube Workshop."

Suzuha: *Her voice rings out, clear and cheerful, disrupting my thoughts.* "Hi! I'm from the Braun Tube Workshop." *Her smile broadens as our eyes meet.*

Suzuha: "The TV you sent in for repairs has been fixed. Mind picking it up?" *She tilts her head, her gaze inquisitive.*

Okabe: *Daru's typing intensifies in the background, his concentration palpable. I quickly nod at Suzuha, indicating my understanding, and quickly exit the room.*

Suzuha: *She follows me, her eyes wide with curiosity.* "Why do we have to be sneaky?"

Okabe: *I glance at her, my memory struggling to recall her name. Ah, right, Amane. Amane Suzuha.* "Currently, my genius partner in crime is executing an important mission. I don't want to bother him."

Suzuha: *She raises an eyebrow, her interest piqued.* "Hmmm. What exactly do you guys do?"

Okabe: *I lock eyes with her, my tone serious.* "I told you before that learning our secrets could put you and everyone you know in grave danger."

Suzuha: *Her expression remains unphased.* "You're called the Future Gadget Laboratory, right?"

Okabe: *I stiffen, a spike of paranoia driving me to my feet.* "How did you know that!? I never told you. Wait, are you an Organization spy!?" *I brace myself, assuming a defensive stance.*

Suzuha: *She blinks, her face a picture of innocence.* "That's what it said on your mailbox."

Okabe: *I let out a sigh, my body relaxing.* "...Oh."

Okabe: "N-now that you know, it's not like you can un-know. I'll give you the short explanation. But you must not tell a soul." *I glance at her, searching for any signs of deceit.*

Suzuha: *She nods, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.*

Okabe: *I clear my throat, preparing to deliver my rehearsed speech.* "We are the Future Gadget Laboratory, dedicated to defeating the evil organization that rules the world from the shadows. Muhahaha!"

Suzuha: "Wow... Is the evil organization SERN?" *Her voice is filled with awe and curiosity.*

Okabe: "...!? Y-yeah, but..."

Suzuha: "Oh! So I was right? Those guys really are a contemptible lot, aren’t they?" *She nods to herself, her face serious.*

Okabe: "How did you know we were hacking into SERN!?" *My voice rises in disbelief and suspicion.*

Suzuha: "What? You’re hacking them? Right now?" *She looks at me, surprise evident on her face.*

Okabe: "Just answer my question! How did you know about our business with SERN!?" *I demand, my patience wearing thin.*

Suzuha: "Ah, umm, well... Weeell, ahahah, actually, I overheard you this afternoon. If you stand here, you can hear stuff from the window." *She shrugs, a sheepish smile on her face.*
