Suzuha: *I cross my arms, leaning back with a teasing grin.* "That was so manly! I might be falling for you."

Okabe: *I sneer, thrusting a finger in her direction.* "Hmph, you think you can trick me like that? You’re lying, aren’t you?"

Suzuha: *I tilt my head, a look of innocent confusion on my face.* "Eh? What makes you think that?"

Okabe: *I puff out my chest, trying to look as imposing as possible.* "It’s one of my powers... Coloring Gentleman." *I let my words hang in the air, enjoying the dramatic effect.* 

Suzuha: *I blink in surprise, but then clear my throat, hiding my reaction.* "Y-you have powers?"

Okabe: *I nod, a smug smile on my face.* "Are you some kind of esper?"

Suzuha: *I lean in close, whispering into his ear with a mischievous smile.* "Are there a lot of espers like you?"

Okabe: *I thrust my chest out as far as possible, radiating confidence.* "Of course not. I am special!"

Suzuha: *I relax, letting out a sigh of relief.* "Oh... You had me scared for a second there. But still, it’s amazing that people like you exist. Maybe SERN is the reason there aren’t more where I came from..."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, intrigued by her mutterings.* "By the way, does the ability to see through lies have any combat application at all? If it were me, I’d want perfect accuracy within a thousand meters, or ultra-fast reflexes that let me tear my enemy’s limbs off before they can react."

Suzuha: *I tilt my head, a playful smile on my face.* "You... you’re an Organization assassin, aren’t you? You must be the one they call Miss Golgo! Who hired you!?"

Okabe: *I point an accusing finger at her, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Nobody hired me. What’s a Golgo?"

Suzuha: *I laugh, trying to lighten the mood.* "Anyway, do you have any other powers?"

Okabe: *I cross my arms, a serious expression on my face.* "Even if I did, there’s no way I’d tell a hitman hired to kill me."

Suzuha: *I roll my eyes, a grin spreading across my face.* "I’m not going to kill you."

Okabe: *I hold my ground, my gaze never leaving hers.* "Revealing my powers would be suicide. They are most effective with the element of surprise. In other words, they’re for me to know and you to find out!"

Suzuha: *I pout, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Meanie."

Okabe: *I shrug, a smug smile on my face.* "Say what you like."

Suzuha: *I look away, trying to hide my disappointment.* "Why the frown? Did you get a death notice?"

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, caught off guard by her question.* "A what?"

Suzuha: *I quickly cover up my slip with a nervous laugh.* "...J-just wondering."
