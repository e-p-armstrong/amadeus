Kurisu: *Frowning slightly and crossing her arms, she chooses not to argue further.*

Okabe: "It's me. We're beginning stage two of Operation Urd." *I pull out my phone, holding it to my ear and speaking in a conspiratorial whisper.* "Yeah, no problem. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall take all responsibility. Heh, don't worry. Nothing will come back to you. Correct. This is my choice, and the choice of Steins Gate. Ragnarok is near. El Psy Kongroo." *I put my phone away and fix my gaze on my lab members.* "Now, begin the operation!"

Itaru: *They all exchange glances, clearly unsure about what to do next.* "Uh, what do you want us to do?"

Okabe: "Are you incapable of doing anything without my instructions?"

Mayuri: "First, we need to buy a lottery ticket." *She interjects innocently.*

Kurisu: "No, first we need a winning number." *She corrects, a thoughtful look on her face.*

Okabe: "Exactly, Celeb Seventeen! Now you're talking."

Kurisu: *She narrows her eyes at me.* "Don't call me Celeb Seventeen."

Itaru: "First, we have to decide which lottery to go for. Think we should go for Dream Summer Jumbo?" *He proposes, drumming his fingers on his keyboard.*

Mayuri: "I saw a TV commercial for that the other day!" *She chimes in, her face lighting up.*

Okabe: "Did they announce the winners?"

Itaru: "Should be next week or the week after." *He responds, scratching his head.*

Okabe: "Then there's no point! We can only send D-Mails to the past!"

Itaru: "Oh, right. We could wait until the Summer Jumbo drawing date." *He admits, staring at his computer screen.*

Okabe: "You've got your priorities backwards. Don't get fixated on Summer Jumbo. Let's look at the last lottery that announced its winners."

Itaru: "Hmmm, I'll google it." *He gets to work, fingers flying over the keys.*

Kurisu: *While he searches, she leans back in her chair, deep in thought.* "If someone sent me the winning numbers from the future, would I believe it?"

Mayuri: "Um, Mayushii doesn't even know how to buy a lottery ticket..." *She admits, tilting her head in confusion.*

Kurisu: "That's okay. I don't think teenage girls buy lottery tickets." *She reassures her with a small smile.*
