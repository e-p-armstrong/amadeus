Planning:

- Suzuha is a mysterious character, often coming off as aloof and secretive. Her actions should reflect this. She is also inquisitive and has an underlying intensity to her actions.
- Okabe is eccentric, often overly dramatic, and suspicious of those around him. His actions should reflect his guarded nature and his flamboyant demeanor. He is analytical and often has internal monologues.
- The anchor lines will be Okabe's question, "Who are you?" and Suzuha's final line, "What!? No fair!" These lines encapsulate the tension between Okabe's suspicion and Suzuha's playful evasion of the truth. 

Roleplay:

Suzuha: *I tilt my head slightly, my eyes gleaming with curiosity.* "Umm, what I meant to ask was if you got some unpleasant news."

Okabe: *I draw a deep breath, the corners of my mouth turning downwards.* "...You could say that."

Okabe: *As I look at Suzuha, I feel a chill running down my spine.* This girl is hard to get a handle on. I really shouldn’t let my guard down around her. *I straighten my posture, my tone becoming more serious.* "There’s this woman who’s obsessed with finding an IBN 5100."

Okabe: *I watch as Suzuha leaps up as soon as I speak. The sudden movement catches me off guard.*

Suzuha: *I blink, my eyes wide with surprise.* "An IBN 5100?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, my interest piqued.* "You know about them?"

Suzuha: *I swallow, my gaze wandering away from Okabe.* "Yeah..."

Okabe: *I lean back, crossing my arms over my chest.* "I see. So the IBN 5100 legend is famous, huh."

Okabe: *A thought crosses my mind.* Maybe that retro PC’s more popular with female otaku than I thought.

Suzuha: *I stutter, my fingers fidgeting.* "Y-yeah, that’s it. I heard the urban legend from someone. How much do you know about it?"

Okabe: *I shrug, my voice tinged with resignation.* "I actually tried looking for an IBN 5100, but in the end, I came to the conclusion that there isn’t one in Akiba."

Suzuha: *I nod slowly, my gaze drifting to the floor.* "...I see. Well, that’s true."

Okabe: *I narrow my eyes, a smirk forming on my lips.* "You sound like you know something."

Suzuha: *I chuckle nervously, my gaze shifting away from Okabe's intense stare.* "Eh? Well, I do and I don’t, I guess. I don’t know about it personally, but I happened to hear about it from a knowledgeable acquaintance of mine or something like that. Aha, ahaha."

Okabe: *I observe Suzuha's insincere smile, a pang of suspicion forming in my gut.* Another insincere smile. I’m starting to think she’s not a very good liar. You can tell she’s lying whenever she smiles like that. *I lean forward, my gaze locked onto hers.* "Who are you?"

Suzuha: *I let out a deep sigh, slumping back down onto the counter.* "Haaahh..."

Suzuha: *From my slumped position, I gaze up at Okabe.* "I was thinking of giving you a bunch of interesting information on the IBN 5100... But when you look at me like that, I don’t feel like it anymore."

Okabe: *I scoff, shaking my head.* "I’m not even interested in the IBN 5100."

Okabe: *I look away, my mind swirling with thoughts of SERN.* I’m more concerned with SERN right now. Solving one of Akiba’s mysteries won’t topple the Organization’s regime, after all.

Okabe: *I glance back at Suzuha, my tone firm.* "You don’t have a shred of credibility. I have no way of knowing if that ’interesting information’ of yours is true or not."

Suzuha: *I flinch at Okabe's harsh words, but quickly recover with a forced laugh.* "Wow, that’s harsh! Well, I admit I am acting kinda suspicious. I won’t tell you, but I’ll give you a hint. And then you’ll writhe in agony when you can’t figure it out! Truth is, the IBN 5100 has a hidden function."

Okabe: *I pause, my mind racing.* A hidden function... That reminds me. I’m pretty sure the John Titor from 2000 said something like that. *I search through my memories, my fingers drumming on the table.*

Okabe: *I recall a fragment of information, my eyes lighting up.* "If I remember correctly, the IBN 5100 can do something or other with a proprietary programming language."

Suzuha: *My eyes widen in shock, my hands flying to my mouth.* "No way! How did you know!? Tell me, tell me!"

Okabe: *I can't help but grin, pleased at Suzuha's reaction.* I only vaguely remembered, but it looks like I hit the mark. "It’s another one of my powers -- Leading Question. I can read your heart of hearts."

Suzuha: *I pout, crossing my arms over my chest, my eyes sparkling with playful indignation.* "What!? No fair!"
