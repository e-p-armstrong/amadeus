3. Mayuri: She is a cheerful and innocent character, often providing a light-hearted touch to the intense situations.

Writing Styles:

1. Suzuha: Her actions will be direct and a bit cryptic, matching her serious and intense personality.
2. Okabe: His thoughts will be complex and detailed, reflecting his keen sense of observation and his eccentric nature.

Anchors: 

1. Suzuha's line about the hidden function of the IBN 5100. This is a key revelation in the story and should be treated as such.
2. Okabe's line about sending an email to Titor. This is a key decision point in the story and should be treated as such.

Roleplay: 

Suzuha: *I clench my fists, my eyes burning with intensity.* "Kuh! Anyway, the IBN 5100 has a hidden function! It can decipher IBN’s proprietary programming language, which was written before APL and BASIC became widespread. Isn’t that surprising?" *I let out a dry chuckle, the corners of my mouth twisting into a smirk.*

Okabe: *I feel a jolt of realization, my mind racing back to the past.* "Now I remember. John Titor said the same thing in 2000. And right after that, an IBN engineer officially admitted to that function’s existence." *My fingers twitch at the memory, the pieces of the puzzle starting to fall into place.*

Suzuha: *I look down, my fingers tracing the metal pin in my hand.* "Now it’s a dead programming language that can only be deciphered with an IBN 5100." *I say, my gaze lingering on the pin, lost in thoughts.*

Okabe: *I furrow my brows, deep in thought, watching Suzuha play with the pin.* "The reason Titor traveled to 1975 to obtain an IBN 5100 was because he needed that function. Maybe Moeka wants to use it too. Or maybe not. Shining Finger doesn’t seem like the type who’d know about that sort of function." *I mutter, my mind spinning with possibilities.*

Suzuha: *I finally look up, my gaze meeting Okabe's.* "That’s why IBN 5100s are so rare." *I say, a hint of sadness tingeing my voice.*

Okabe: *I let out a sigh, my eyes drifting towards Daru, who is still furiously typing away on his keyboard.* "Twenty hours have passed since Daru started hacking. Night gives way to a refreshing summer morning." *I say, my voice barely above a whisper. I then look down at my phone, my fingers typing out an email to Titor.* "Alright, let's send it now. If he can’t answer to my satisfaction, then the current Titor is an impostor. This is your litmus test, John Titor. Heh heh heh. So, what are your true colors?" *I murmur, a smirk playing on my lips as I hit the send button.*

Mayuri: *I walk into the room, a bright smile on my face.* "Tutturu♪ Good morning!" *I cheerfully greet everyone, my voice bringing a hint of normalcy to the intense atmosphere.*

Okabe: *I look up from my phone, a surprised look on my face.* "What are you doing here so early?" *I ask, my voice filled with curiosity and a hint of relief at seeing Mayuri's cheerful demeanor.*
