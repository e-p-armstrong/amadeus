Okabe: *I nod approvingly, my voice carrying a hint of satisfaction.* "Excellent. Good job."

Mayuri: *I begin to rummage through my convenience store bag, my fingers brushing against various items before finally pulling out...* "Tada! Canned oden!"

Okabe: *I feel the warmth of the canned oden as Mayuri hands it to me, and I immediately open the lid, savoring the smell of the beef. It's a familiar and comforting aroma.* "I’ve been getting tired of eating bananas and chicken lately. Buy these instead from now on."

Mayuri: *I pout slightly, my voice tinged with a playful whine.* "But Mayushii doesn’t have enough pocket money to splurge like this all the time. And Mayushii loves bananas and chicken, so she’ll keep buying them."

Okabe: *I consider warning her about the dangers of a diet solely consisting of frozen foods, but I hold my tongue. Knowing Mayuri, it wouldn't make much of a difference anyway.* 

Mayuri: *I reach into my bag again, pulling out a small box with a RaiNet illustration. My eyes sparkle with excitement as I present it.* "But wait, there’s more. Tada♪ RaiNet sausage! It comes with an Upa bottle cap as a bonus! I really wanted it, so I bought it."

Okabe: *I chuckle at her enthusiasm, finding it both endearing and slightly amusing. Mayuri and her obsession with Upa goods... it's a constant in an ever-changing world.* 

Mayuri: *I tilt my head slightly, my eyes filled with concern.* "So how’s Daru-kun?"

Okabe: *I sigh, rubbing my temples as I think about Daru's current situation.* "He’s in the midst of a hard fight. He should at least rest a little. I mean, I never said he had to do it all at once."

Mayuri: *I pump my fist in the air, a hint of admiration in my voice.* "Daru-kun’s super hacka spirit is on fire!"

Itaru: *I whip an empty diet cola bottle through the air, my voice carrying a note of frustration.* "Don’t say hacka!"

Mayuri: *I glance at Itaru, my voice quiet and thoughtful.* "He sure is tense..."

Okabe: *I guide Mayuri to a corner of the room, and we sit down to eat the oden in silence. It's a small moment of peace in the midst of chaos.*

Mayuri: *I frown slightly, my voice filled with worry.* "But, isn’t hacking bad? Mayushii doesn’t want you to do bad things..."

Okabe: *I lean back, my gaze fixed on the ceiling as I contemplate our situation. A fierce determination burns in my eyes.* "I would be a fool to let Daru’s super hacka... I mean, hacker skills go to waste. Besides, we’re doing this to expose SERN’s wrongdoings. This is a war against the dark forces that secretly rule the world!"

Mayuri: *I wring my hands together, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Bad things are bad."
