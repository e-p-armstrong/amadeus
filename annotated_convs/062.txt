Okabe: *I nod in agreement, my gaze locked onto the computer screen.* "Same."

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, a mischievous grin spreading across my face.* "Basically, if this is the server admin’s password, we can taste every inch of SERN’s luscious, luscious flesh. But if it’s just an ordinary researcher’s password, then we can only see SERN’s boobs."

Mayuri: *My eyes widen in shock, my hands fluttering to my mouth.* "Daru-kun, that’s naughty!"

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, my fingers drumming impatiently on the desk.* "Quit the erotic examples. Basically, you mean there’ll be limits to what information we can access."

Itaru: *I nod, stifling a yawn with the back of my hand.* "Exactly. Anyway, it’s only a matter of time before I get a server admin’s password. Let’s save that for later. I’m really sleepy now."

Okabe: *I glance at Daru, concern etching lines onto my forehead.* It would be cruel to push Daru any further. It’s unfortunate, but overworking him isn’t an option. Let’s let him rest so he can regain his energy. *A sigh escapes my lips.* "Oh! Looks like our ID belongs to an accelerator division chief."

Itaru: *I chuckle, stretching my arms above my head.* "So it’s not a server admin..."

Okabe: *My brow furrows, a hint of disappointment coloring my tone.* "It would take a miracle to get one on our first try. How many staff members do you think SERN has?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a curious expression on my face.* "How many?"

Itaru: *I grin, my fingers dancing over the keyboard.* "Over 6000."

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, my mind reeling at the sheer number.* That many? "Well, for now, let’s look at this accelerator division chief. Uh, his name is... Jack. Let’s look at his email log."

Mayuri: *I grimace, my fingers instinctively reaching for my temples.* "Oh no... that makes Mayushii’s head hurt..."

Okabe: *I smirk, my gaze returning to the screen.* Hmph. It’s pathetic to flinch at the mere sight of English. "Daru, what does that say?"

Itaru: *I squint at the screen, my fingers hovering over the keyboard.* "Need to translate it..."

Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, a smirk playing on my lips.* "This is a job for Dr. Excite!"

Itaru: *I shake my head, a smirk matching mine on his face.* "Nah. I’ve got a better idea."

Okabe: *I watch as Daru boots up translation software and auto-translates the open page. Poor, unnatural Japanese shows up. The first line says HAPPY NEW YEAR.* "Looks like a new year’s greeting. Something about going on vacation in Spain... lucky bastard."

Itaru: *I shrug, my gaze scanning the next email.* "If we keep scouring the log like this, we can also identify the server manager."

Mayuri: *I look down, my fingers nervously playing with the hem of my skirt.* "You know, looking through someone else’s email without permission makes me feel really guilty..."

Okabe: *I notice Mayuri get depressed and move away from the computer. She sits on the sofa and hugs her giant Upa cushion with a sigh. I know we’re doing something socially unacceptable. However...* "I abandoned guilt when I chose the path of Evil long ago! Muhahaha! Let the responsibility be mine. I will not ask you to answer for my crimes."

Itaru: *I laugh, a playful smirk on my face.* "What a guy! I’d let Okarin do me in the butt."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a hint of amusement in my voice.* "I decline your offer. Now get peeking, Daru!"

Mayuri: *I pout, my arms crossing over my chest.* "Okarin, you’re bad... You make Mayushii sad."

Okabe: *I ignore Mayuri's disapproval, my gaze returning to the screen.* That’s of no concern to me. You just sit there and pretend your hands are clean. Upon further examination, we discover several emails with the title Experiment report. In English, naturally. Looks like he sends emails like these almost daily. "LHC experiment reports? There could be a hint about time machines in there. We should try reading them."

Itaru: *I pause, my fingers hovering over the keyboard.* "This is definitely a crime, though..."
