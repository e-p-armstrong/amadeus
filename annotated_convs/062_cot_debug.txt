Luka: "Actually, Okabe-san... I mean, Kyouma-san, there's something I need to apologize for..." *He fumbles with something in his hand, his voice shaky.*

Okabe: *I'm taken aback as Luka reveals a LOTO SIX ticket.* "Ah...!" *I reach out abruptly, grabbing Luka's wrist.* "Where did you get this!?"

Luka: "T-that hurts..." *He winces, trying to pull his hand back.*

Mayuri: "Don't pick on Luka-kun!" *She steps in, placing herself between Luka and me. Her protective stance forces me to release Luka's wrist.*

Okabe: *I step back, my hand still hovering in the air where Luka's wrist was moments ago.*

Kurisu: "What's wrong with you, Okabe?" *She looks at me, her brow furrowed in confusion.* "You're acting weird."
