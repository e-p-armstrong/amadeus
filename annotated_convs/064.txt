Itaru: *I furrow my brows in concentration, my fingers dancing over the keyboard.* "Hmmm, let’s try looking for a document... ah, found one." *My eyes skim over the document, my mouth curving into a smirk at the discovery.*

Okabe: *My eyes narrow, a hint of suspicion clouding my gaze.* "...Government secrets?"

Itaru: *I chuckle nervously, rubbing the back of my neck as I consider the implications.* "SERN’s not even a government organization, so why? Wait, should we be looking at this stuff? We might be in a little deep here."

Okabe: *I dismiss his concerns with a wave of my hand, my voice filled with determination.* "I don’t care. Get me details."

Itaru: *I sigh, running my fingers through my hair in frustration.* "Hold on. If we get caught, we’re not getting off with an apology."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a smirk playing on my lips.* "Are you so incompetent as to let yourself be traced?"

Itaru: *I roll my eyes, crossing my arms over my chest.* "...I took the necessary precautions."

Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, crossing my arms over my chest in satisfaction.* "Then I fail to see the problem."

Itaru: *I mumble under my breath, making a slightly awkward face as I take the file about the Z Program and feed it into the translation software.* "Well, thanks."

Itaru: *I read aloud, my voice wavering slightly with uncertainty.* "Hmm... ’May 14th, 137th Z Program Experiment Report’... ’Because we have already succeeded at creating mini black holes, the report is omitted. First--’"

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest, adrenaline coursing through my veins. The room around me seems to blur as the gravity of the situation hits me.* "Stop! Stooopp!"

Okabe: *I slam my fist on the table, my voice shaking with excitement and fear.* "So SERN did use the LHC to generate mini black holes!"

Itaru: *I scratch my head, my brows furrowed in confusion.* "But they announced that their experiments still haven’t succeeded, so why..."

Okabe: *I snort, leaning back in my chair with a grim smile.* "But in reality, they’re already generating those mini black holes."

Itaru: *I nod slowly, my gaze still glued to the screen.* "Sure does seem like it."

Okabe: *I lean forward, my eyes burning with curiosity.* "What does it say next?"

Itaru: *I squint at the screen, my mouth going dry as I read the next part.* "Umm... ’Results: Error. Human is dead, mismatch. For details, consult Jellyman’s Report No. 14.’ ’We propose that further experiments be halted until the lifter is perfected and all local field conformity points are online.’"

Okabe: *My heart drops to my stomach, a cold shiver running down my spine.* "Wh-what does that mean?"

Itaru: *I swallow hard, my voice barely above a whisper.* "’Human is dead’ means somebody died, right?"

Okabe: *I feel my blood run cold, my mind racing as I try to comprehend the gravity of the situation.* "Wha..."

Okabe: *I clutch my chest, my heart pounding as I try to calm my racing thoughts. This isn't a joke anymore. Something very serious is going on here.* "What is this Jellyman’s Report?"

Itaru: *I start typing once Okabe asks his question, but soon click my tongue in frustration.* "I can’t find it in Jack’s email. We’ll need an account with more privileges."

Okabe: *I sigh, running a hand through my hair as I try to make sense of it all.* "Then we’ll save that for next time. Search for something related to time machines."

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, a smirk tugging at the corner of my mouth.* "You know we’re not going to find anything, right?"
