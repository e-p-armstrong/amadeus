Okabe: *I storm into the lab, a look of determination etched on my face.* "Wait! We'll talk when everything's over." *I quickly dismiss everyone, my gaze fixed on the computer screen.*

Mayuri: *Mayuri picks up her Upa plush toy and hands it to me, a worried look in her eyes.* "Um, I'll buy more bananas tomorrow, okay? So for now, hug this little guy suuuuper tight and cheer up, okay?"

Okabe: *I watch as Mayuri, Daru, Lukako, and Moeka leave the lab, one by one. Soon, only Kurisu and I are left.* "Hey, assistant. You're not going back to your hotel?"

Kurisu: "Is there a problem?" *She shoots me a questioning look.*

Okabe: "No, no problem. I was just wondering what you were still doing here." *I glance at her, my curiosity piqued.*

Kurisu: "Nothing. I just wanted to think for a bit." *She shrugs, her gaze focused on the floor.*

Okabe: "Can't you think at your hotel?" *I ask, a slight frown on my face.*

Kurisu: "What? You're kicking me out?" *She looks up at me, her brows furrowed in confusion.*

Okabe: "Ahh, I get it. You'd be lonely in your hotel room, but you have no friends, so you want me, the great Hououin Kyouma, to look after you. Isn't that right, you spoiled Celeb Sev?" *I smirk, leaning against the lab table.*

Kurisu: "You're the lonely one, aren't you? You've been acting gloomy all day. Do you need some advice? I'm an outsider, in a sense, so it should be easier to talk to me, right? A man getting advice from a younger woman is kind of *mumble mumble*, but if you're fine with that, then just ask away." *She folds her arms, a teasing grin on her face.*

Okabe: *I roll my eyes at her sarcasm.* "I need to send some emails. If you insist on staying here, then be quiet and stay out of my way. Okay, Zombie?"

Kurisu: "Of all your stupid names, that one's the worst." *She scoffs, but settles down on the sofa with a massive technical book.*

Okabe: "Want some coffee?" *I ask, glancing at her.*

Kurisu: "Sure." *She looks up from her book, nodding.*

Okabe: *I make some instant coffee for Kurisu, then sit down in front of the computer with a fresh Dr P.* "Alright, let's do what needs to be done. I only hope this doesn't get undone too." *I mutter to myself, my eyes scanning the screen.*

Kurisu: "What's wrong with you? Stop fidgeting." *She calls out from the sofa, her eyes never leaving her book.*
