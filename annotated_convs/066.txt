Okabe: *Turning my attention away from my phone, I look at Kurisu, who is deeply engrossed in her book.* "Christina. There's something I want to talk to you about."

Kurisu: *She continues reading, not looking up.* "Shouldn't you answer your phone first?"

Okabe: "It's Daru. It's probably something stupid." *I dismiss the call, placing my phone back on the table.* 

Kurisu: *She finally looks up, a hint of irritation in her eyes.* "You're really self-righteous, you know."

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, preparing to share my theory.* "You might not remember this, but earlier, I changed the past with a D-Mail."

Kurisu: *Her eyes narrow, scrutinizing me.* "...I haven't known you long enough to tell whether you're serious."

Okabe: *I meet her gaze, determination in my eyes.* "It happened. And then everyone except me forgot about it. Or rather, the fact that it happened was erased from history."

Kurisu: "The past changed, so the present changed with it? The Butterfly Effect, huh. But what you're saying is nonsense." *She crosses her arms, her tone challenging.*

Okabe: *I lean forward, intrigued by her response.* "Why do you say that?"

Kurisu: "Why do you remember that the past changed? If you used a time machine to physically travel to the past and change history, then that might explain it -- barely. But with a D-Mail, you haven't taken one step outside the present, have you?' So if the present changed, and we changed with it, you would have to change too. Or are you saying you didn't change because you're the observer? In that case, you're claiming that you're not a human being." *She leans back, waiting for my response.*

Okabe: *I smirk, a glimmer of excitement in my eyes.* "...Everything is the choice of Steins Gate! This is the power of my magic eye, Reading Steiner! Muhahaha!" 

Kurisu: *She rolls her eyes, a sigh escaping her lips.* "Aaaand he's at it again." *She returns to her book, shaking her head.*

Kurisu: "I'm not playing along with your games. I bet you came up with that Reading Whatever thing just now, didn't you?" *She murmurs, not looking up from her book.*
