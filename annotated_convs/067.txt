Okabe: *I halt my rant abruptly, catching myself in the act of shouting. A sheepish grin spreads across my face as I realize the window is wide open, potentially broadcasting my secret plans to the entire neighborhood.* "Understand? The world has no need for two mad scientists. Before they can get ahead of us, we must outwit them!"

Itaru: *I blink at Okabe, my eyes wide with confusion.* "Who are they?"

Okabe: *I wave my hand dismissively, an enigmatic smile playing on my lips.* "You know... them."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, my brows furrowed in confusion.* "Um, Mayushii doesn’t get it at all..."

Okabe: *I slam my hand down on the table, a triumphant grin spreading across my face.* "Basically, we must obtain the phantom retro PC... the IBN 5100, said to be located somewhere in Akiba."

Okabe: *I pause, waiting for a reaction. When none comes, I slump in my chair, my enthusiasm deflated.* Dammit, is there anything you guys react to!? We’ve uncovered a massive conspiracy here! How come you aren’t excited!?

Itaru: *I shrug, yawning lazily.* "I’ll pass on the search. I’m seriously tired. Besides, I want to keep combing SERN’s server."

Okabe: *I nod thoughtfully, a grimace of understanding twisting my features.* "That’s true... Well, you’re the only one who can do that, Daru, so I’ll leave it to you. So, the IBN 5100 investigation squad shall consist of Mayuri and me--"

Mayuri: *I shake my head gently, a look of regret crossing my face.* "I can’t... I have to make costumes, and I have work, too."

Okabe: *I sigh deeply, my shoulders slumping in disappointment.* "Fine. I’ll manage alone somehow. It’s useless to try and stop me. Understood?"

Mayuri: *I look at Okabe with wide, worried eyes.* "Are you going to do something bad again?"

Itaru: *I laugh, shaking my head at Okabe's dramatics.* "Nah, he’s all talk."

Okabe: *I huff in annoyance, spinning on my heel to leave the lab. As I step out onto the street, a bicycle skids to a stop in front of me.*

Suzuha: *I hop off my bicycle, grinning widely at Okabe.* "Hiya, Okabe Rintaro."

Okabe: *I eye the bicycle appreciatively, my gaze lingering on its shiny exterior.* "Pretty nice technique there."

Suzuha: *I beam at Okabe, my eyes sparkling with joy.* "Bicycles are fun, aren’t they? I’d never ridden one before coming here."

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, my eyebrows shooting up in disbelief.* "You’d never ridden a bicycle!?"

Suzuha: *I shake my head, a mischievous grin playing on my lips.* "Nope. I had ridden motorcycles before, though."

Okabe: *I frown, my brows furrowing in confusion.* Isn’t that backwards? Weird girl. And what’s with that flashy braking back there? I think it’d be pretty dangerous if she did that all through the town. Beginners get cocky and get into accidents. You see that pattern all the time. If you’re going to go full speed, at least wear a helmet. "Going to work now?"

Suzuha: *I nod, swinging my leg over my bicycle.* "Yup."
