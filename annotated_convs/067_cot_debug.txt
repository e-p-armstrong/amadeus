Okabe: "Oh, it's you. You're with Daru, right? You don't have to lend that dumbass any money, okay?" *I warn Kurisu, my hands gesturing towards Daru with a dismissive wave.*

Mayuri: "Um, okay♪ So, Okarin, I was wondering if you cheered up. Did you hug Upa like I said?" *She asks, her voice filled with concern.*

Okabe: "No! I am a mad scientist full of madness and ambition!" *I exclaim, striking a dramatic pose.*

Mayuri: "That's good! You know, if you're worried about anything, talk to Mayushii, okay? Mayushii doesn't understand hard things, but she does understand Okarin♪" *She reassures me with a bright, comforting smile.*

Okabe: "You understand me?" *I ask, a hint of surprise in my voice.* "...Hmph. I'm hanging up. Work hard now." *I end the call with a dismissive wave.*

Kurisu: "Okabe. You're grinning." *She points out, a teasing smile on her face.*

Okabe: "...!! N-nonsense, Celeb Sev!" *I stutter, hastily trying to hide my grin with a cough.*

Kurisu: "Don't call me Celeb Sev!" *She protests, a hint of annoyance in her voice.*

Okabe: "Are you really that desperate for attention?" *I retort, a playful smirk on my face.*

Kurisu: "Just getting revenge. You're always making fun of me, so I deserve at least this much." *She responds, her eyes flickering with determination.*

Okabe: "Despite what you may think, I actually respect you." *I say sincerely, my usual flamboyance replaced with a rare moment of seriousness.* "I'm sorry about that."

Kurisu: "Well, that's unexpected... You actually apologized." *She looks at me in surprise, taken aback by my sudden change in demeanor.*

Okabe: "I do apologize. But I can't help it. For my brain has recorded you as my assistant, Christina, and I cannot correct it! MUHAHAHAHA!" *I burst into laughter, my previous sincerity replaced with my usual mad scientist persona.*

Kurisu: "I'm gonna crack your skull open and stick electrodes in your hippocampus." *She threatens, her tone deadpan.*

Okabe: "John Titor." *I say, my eyes fixated on the screen of my phone.*

Kurisu: "Huh? No way." *Her eyes widen in surprise, clearly intrigued by this new development.*

Okabe: "Not entirely. But there are several points in his story I do agree with." *I explain, my gaze still fixated on the screen.*

Kurisu: "Really? I can't see it as anything but fiction." *She responds, a skeptical frown on her face.*

Okabe: "Muhahahahaha!" *I burst into laughter, raising my phone high in the air.* "My true power... is the magic eye, 'Reading Steiner'!"

Kurisu: "Sounds to me like you've got a bad case of chuunibyou." *She comments, rolling her eyes at my dramatic proclamation.*
