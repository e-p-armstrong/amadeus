Suzuha: *I sigh, looking at Okabe with a hint of exasperation.* "Ehh? But I need to get the shop ready for business."

Okabe: *I wave my hand dismissively, a smirk on my face.* "Just what does this crumbly old Braun Tube Workshop need to get ’ready’?"

Suzuha: *I shrug, sweeping my gaze over the old shop.* "Nothing, really. Geez. I just mindlessly sweep in front of the shop. If I clean inside, the boss gets angry. ’Everything’s where it needs to be,’ he says."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a hint of disbelief in my voice.* "So he’s paying you to not clean? Something’s wrong with that guy." *I mutter to myself, shaking my head.* "So hear me out, then."

Suzuha: *I sigh, rubbing my temples.* "But I’m so tired."

Okabe: *I narrow my eyes at her, my tone taking a darker turn.* "In other words, she doesn’t feel like talking. You would be... unwise to anger me."

Suzuha: *I look at him, unfazed.* "Does it have to be right now?"

Okabe: *I maintain my stern expression, giving her a firm nod.* "My glare is not very effective. She doesn’t falter at all. Then go ahead."

Suzuha: *I shrug, locking my bicycle.* "But keep it short, okay?"

Okabe: *I lean in closer, my eyes boring into hers.* "Where is the IBN 5100?"

Suzuha: *I shake my head, my expression serious.* "No intel yet."

Okabe: *I recoil, a look of surprise on my face.* "What?"

Suzuha: *I shrug again, looking apologetic.* "I don’t know."

Okabe: *I frown, feeling a wave of disappointment.* "Oh. But by the way you talked yesterday, it sure sounded like you knew."

Suzuha: *I nod, a small smile on my face.* "No, I know someone who knows."

Okabe: *I straighten, determination in my eyes.* "Then take me to them. I won’t take no for an answer. Refuse, and I’ll show you a living hell."

Suzuha: *I shake my head, looking at him with regret.* "I can’t."

Okabe: *I sigh in frustration, running a hand through my hair.* "Come on! I even said I’d show you a living hell!"

Suzuha: *I look at him, my gaze steady.* "I can’t introduce you even if I wanted to."

Okabe: *I frown, confusion on my face.* "What do you mean? Don’t tell me they’re an imaginary--"

Suzuha: *I interrupt him, my voice quiet.* "They’ve been dead for years."

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback.* "I’m sorry."

Suzuha: *I shake my head, giving him a small smile.* "Nah, it’s okay. Anyway, there’s nothing I can tell you. Honestly, I’m hoping you can tell me something."

Okabe: *I feel a hand on my shoulder, and I turn to see Suzuha looking at me with a hopeful expression.* "Suzuha pats me on the shoulders. Funny. You’d think I’m the one who’s supposed to cheer her up."

Tennouji: *Suddenly, the door slams open and Tennouji steps out, a scowl on his face.* "Hey, part-timer! It’s only your third day and you’re late!?"

Suzuha: *I jump, turning to face him with an apologetic look.* "Sorry, boss! The streets were a little crowded this morning."

Tennouji: *He glares at me, his voice gruff.* "If you’re not gonna take this seriously, I can always give you the boot, hear? As for you, Okabe, don’t you lay a finger on my part-timer."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a smirk on my face.* "Aren’t you the lecherous one here, Mister Braun?"

Tennouji: *He points a finger at me, anger in his eyes.* "Why you. Just try saying something like that in front of Nae. I’ll murder ya. Gotta keep my honor as a father. Besides, I ain’t got no use for a skinny kid like her."

Suzuha: *I gasp, turning to face him with a glare.* "What was that!? Take that back, boss!"

Okabe: *I watch as Suzuha's temper flares, a hint of amusement on my face.* "Suzuha’s actually mad now."

Tennouji: *He raises an eyebrow, looking at her with surprise.* "What, you mad?"

Suzuha: *I cross my arms, my gaze defiant.* "I’m not a kid! I’m a warrior!"

Tennouji: *He blinks, taken aback.* "Hah? What’re you talking about?"

Okabe: *Impulsively, I reach out and take Suzuha's hand, my voice filled with admiration.* "Suzuha’s burning passion has the manager shocked. I, on the other hand, am impressed. I like the look in your eyes, you Part-Time Warrior. They shine with the radiance of the beast unseen in modern men. Never forget those eyes of yours, and you shall surely change class from Part-Time Warrior... to True Warrior."
