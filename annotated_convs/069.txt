Okabe: "Who's writing that report?" *I ask, looking expectantly across the table at Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "You, of course." *She replies, not missing a beat.* "This is your operation. And if we could get a report from the subject too, that would be even better." *Kurisu glances at Daru, a clear hint in her gaze.*

Okabe: "...Are you not interested in changing the past?" *I lean forward, challenging her.* "What happened to your eagerness to experiment?"

Kurisu: "Did you forget what I said this afternoon?" *She retorts, crossing her arms defiantly.* "I'm against it."

Okabe: "But you were so enthusiastic when we began the experiments. You went along without a single complaint." *I insist, trying to remind her of her initial enthusiasm.*

Kurisu: "In your dreams, maybe." *She scoffs, shaking her head dismissively.*

Okabe: *Twisting my lips into a grin, I continue my attempt to sway her.* "You're not being objective, Christi... Celeb Sev."

Kurisu: "If you're going to correct yourself, at least get it right." *She shoots back, her tone laced with annoyance.*
