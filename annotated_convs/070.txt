Okabe: *Observing Mayuri's peculiar behavior, I can't help but ponder over the change I've noticed lately. There's an odd switch that seems to flicker inside her, a switch that wasn't there before, or perhaps one I had never noticed. Seeing her reach out towards the sky, oblivious to the time of day, I feel a twinge of concern laced with confusion.* "It’s too early for stars, Mayuri."

Mayuri: *I turn to Okabe, my hand still lingering in the air. A blank smile on my face, I slowly lower my arm, feeling the gentle wind brush against my fingers.* "Did you know? Even during the day, the stars are still up there."

Okabe: *I can't help but frown at her response. Her words strike me as philosophical, a tone I'm not used to hearing from Mayuri. My concern for her safety outweighs my confusion, and I try to steer her attention back to the bustling street around us.* "Getting philosophical is nice and all, but it’s dangerous to stop in the middle of the street."

Mayuri: *I giggle, my eyes twinkling with amusement. Her hand waving dismissively at Okabe's concern, I find myself agreeing with him, even as my mind drifts back to the invisible stars above.* "Ehehe! That’s true. Oh, just now, when I was looking at the stars, I decided to have ramen for lunch today!"
