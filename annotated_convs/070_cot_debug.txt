Okabe: "What? Are you going to tell yourself to go on a diet?" *I ask, my voice filled with mocking humor.* 

Itaru: "I wouldn't diet even if future me told me to." *He responds, not looking up from the device in his hands.* 

Okabe: "You're gonna change the result?" *I ask, raising an eyebrow at him.*

Itaru: "I remember every move Faris-tan made. It'll be easy to take her from behind. Aren't I a genius?" *He smirks, typing rapidly on his phone.* 

Okabe: "Whatever. Daru, prepare to D-Mail!" *I command, waving him away with a dismissive hand.* 

Itaru: "Hell yeah! I'll give it my best shot!" *He responds eagerly, already hunched over the device.*

Okabe: *I move to sit in front of the X68000, checking my watch. It's 6:55 PM. I sigh lightly, unsure if the PhoneWave (name subject to change) will operate at this hour.* 

Kurisu: "So why do you think you're the only one who remembers?" *She asks, her intense gaze fixed on me.*

Okabe: "You're awfully persistent. I see why they call you The Zombie." *I tease, trying to lighten the mood.*

Kurisu: "I don't follow." *She frowns, clearly not amused.*

Okabe: "Zombies never stop coming. They're persistent." *I explain, grinning at my own joke.*

Kurisu: "Cut the jokes. I'm serious here." *She snaps, her glare sharper than usual.*

Okabe: "I think that the key is who receives the D-Mail. Only the recipient himself is able to retain his memories. That would be my guess." *I respond, trying to keep the atmosphere light despite her intensity.*

Kurisu: "Hmmm..." *She hums, crossing her arms and looking thoughtful.*

Okabe: "After Daru, you'll send the next D-Mail. Think about what you want to write." *I suggest, turning to look at her.*

Kurisu: "No." *She responds quickly, shaking her head.*

Okabe: "Scared?" *I tease, a smirk playing on my lips.*

Kurisu: "That's not it." *She retorts, her voice firm.*

Okabe: "Then are you worried about time paradoxes?" *I continue to prod, curious about her refusal.*

Kurisu: "Well, there's that, but it's more like a personal policy." *She admits, her gaze shifting away from mine.*

Okabe: "A policy?" *I question, intrigued.*

Kurisu: "Changing the past feels like cheating. I may only have 18 years of life experience, but I don't want to change any of those memories." *She explains, her voice soft.*

Okabe: "I see. You're perfect now, so you don't want to change." *I respond, my tone filled with gentle mockery.*

Kurisu: "That's not what I said... I don't want to deny who I've been. Because even my failures are a part of who I am today." *She protests, her eyes flashing with determination.*

Okabe: "Even if we solved all of the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s problems, you wouldn't use it? Even if John Titor said you could use his time machine to travel to whatever time you wish, you wouldn't use it? Even if a blue robot cat from the future were to jump out of your desk and give you a doorway to everywhere, you wouldn't use it?" *I challenge, raising an eyebrow at her.*

Kurisu: *She nods firmly, her gaze steady.* "I wouldn't."

Okabe: "But you love experiments. Don't you?" *I ask, unable to hide the teasing tone in my voice.*

Kurisu: "S-something wrong with that?" *She stammers, her cheeks flushing a light pink.*

Okabe: "So basically, you like to experiment on other people while you watch and cackle at the results! You truly are a mad scientist!" *I exclaim, laughing at her reaction.*

Kurisu: "Why you--" *She starts, her face turning darker, but is interrupted.*

Itaru: "Done!" *He presents his phone with a triumphant grin.*

Kurisu: "I don't get it." *She says, shaking her head at the device in Itaru's hands.*
