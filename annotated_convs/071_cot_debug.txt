Planning:

The scene involves Okabe and Kurisu who are having a conversation. Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist who is often seen talking to himself via his cell phone, and he is also the one who gave Kurisu the title of his assistant. He's eccentric, flamboyant and often paranoid about the 'Organization'. Kurisu, on the other hand, is a genius neuroscientist who is sometimes unsure how to deal with Okabe's eccentric behavior. She is also stubborn, serious, and a little defensive. Okabe's thoughts and actions will be conveyed in a dramatic, paranoid and flamboyant style. Kurisu's actions will be more subdued, serious, and somewhat confused or exasperated due to Okabe's behavior.

The anchor lines for this scene will be Okabe's: "So, Christina, what brings you here?" and Kurisu's: "...I regret losing myself to curiosity back then." These lines will be expanded to reflect Okabe's flamboyant personality and the air of mystery surrounding the satellite, respectively.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, my lips curling into a smirk as I spot a familiar figure.* "Well, if it isn’t my assistant. What are you doing here?"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, a frown etching onto my face.* "Hey. When did I become your assistant?"

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, trying to hide a smirk as I turn my attention back to my phone, scrolling through my emails.* "And why are you glaring at me, assistant?"

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, confusion creeping into my tone.* "...Why are you glaring at me?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, trying to suppress a smile.* "Don’t worry about it. You’re not the cause of my frustration."

Kurisu: *I narrow my eyes, crossing my arms over my chest defensively.* "Oh, so you’re just raging? Don’t glare at me."

Okabe: *I lean closer, a playful smirk on my face.* "You’ve glared at me before, haven’t you?"

Kurisu: *I quickly avert my gaze, my cheeks flushing a faint pink.* "That’s because you keep doing pervy-- Ah, no, I’m not saying anything."

Okabe: *I sigh in exasperation, running a hand through my hair as I glance back at my phone. The same annoying message popping up.* "Are the emails you’re getting really that unpleasant?"

Okabe: *I rub the bridge of my nose, a frown etching onto my face.* "They’re more... unreasonable than unpleasant."

Okabe: *I turn to Kurisu, my gaze softening a bit.* "So, Christina, what brings you here?"

Kurisu: *I sigh, shaking my head.* "If you’re going to call me names, could you at least be consistent? Anyway, my business here doesn’t concern you."

Okabe: *I tilt my head, a teasing smile dancing on my lips.* "Why are you pouting?"

Kurisu: *I stiffen, my gaze hardening.* "I’m not pouting. I just don’t want to get involved in your silly games again."

Okabe: *I wave my hand dismissively, a confident grin spreading across my face.* "Nonsense. You’re already a lab mem. You have a duty to work for the benefit of the lab!"

Kurisu: *I sigh, my gaze wandering towards the satellite, a look of regret passing over my face.* "...I regret losing myself to curiosity back then."

Okabe: *I follow her gaze, my eyes narrowing as I study the satellite.* "Did you come to see the satellite?"

Kurisu: *I nod, my gaze still fixed on the satellite.* "...I guess. It doesn’t make sense. Normally, they calculate satellites’ orbits so that they burn up in the atmosphere when they fall. So how can that thing be in such perfect condition?"

Okabe: *I lean back, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Where’s this satellite from, anyway?"

Kurisu: *I shrug, shaking my head.* "They still don’t know. Rumors say it’s from the former Soviet Union, but Russia denies it. So it looks like they can’t remove it yet."

Okabe: *My eyes widen, a smirk spreading across my face.* "So it’s another Organization cover-up! They knew I’d be at Radi-Kan and tried to erase me!"
