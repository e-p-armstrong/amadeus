Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, steepling my fingers together as I regard Kurisu with an intense gaze.* "The Organization is the Organization. Its formal name is something else, but all those who know of its existence call it the Organization out of fear. They rule the world from the shadows, transcending nations, with politics, economics, religion, even science in their clutches."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, crossing my arms over my chest in a clear display of disbelief.* "That’s obviously a crackpot conspiracy theory, thank you very mu--" *I pause, blushing as I lower my gaze.*

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, studying her curiously.* "What’s wrong?"

Kurisu: *I shake my head quickly, raising my hand to ward off any further questions.* "N-nothing! Really, nothing, okay? Say another word and I hit you!"

Okabe: *I chuckle to myself, shaking my head at her antics.* "A-anyway! What’s happened with the PhoneWave!?"

Kurisu: *I level a stern look at him, my patience wearing thin.* "I thought you didn’t want to get involved. And it’s not the PhoneWave, it’s the PhoneWave (name subject to change)--"

Okabe: *I interrupt her with a dismissive wave of my hand.* "Just answer me. Have you learned anything?"

Kurisu: *I sigh, feeling a pang of disappointment.* "No progress. We’ve tried repeating the experiment, but at present, we haven’t been able to reproduce the discharge phenomenon or send another email to the past."

Kurisu: *I nod slowly, my mind already working on potential solutions.* "I see..." *I glance at Okabe, noticing him engrossed in his phone.* "Hello? Can you put your phone away when you’re talking with someone?"

Okabe: *I smirk, looking up from my screen.* "Don’t be like that. Rather, you should praise me, for I have taught a foul mail demon to behave like a civilized human being."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow at his statement.* "Why are you so pompous?"

Okabe: *I laugh, my eyes twinkling with mirth.* "I’d ask you the same thing, Christina."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes again, but there's a hint of a smile on my face.* "Are you done with your little mail exchange? Hououin-san?"

Okabe: *I grin, leaning back in my chair.* "Oh? So you remember my true name. Indeed, I am Hououin Kyouma."

Kurisu: *I sigh, shaking my head at his antics.* "I was being facetious."

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, before laughing heartily.* "How was that facetious? You called me by my correct name. You made no mistake. You’ll make a good assistant."

Kurisu: *I look at him, my gaze serious and concerned.* "Okabe-san... have you sought professional help?"

Okabe: *I scoff, waving her concern away.* "I am not Okabe!"

Kurisu: *I sigh deeply, running a hand through my hair.* "This is exhausting..."

Okabe: *I chuckle, shaking my head at her exasperation.* "You’re pompous, but at least you have some manners."

Kurisu: *I glance at him, a bit taken aback.* "What do you mean?"

Okabe: *I smirk, recalling our first meeting.* "I hate people who play with their phones in the middle of a conversation."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, intrigued.* "Ah, so that’s why you grabbed my phone when we first met."

Okabe: *I nod emphatically.* "When we first met? I didn’t do that."

Kurisu: *I frown, trying to recall the event.* "Yeah you did. There I was, giving my report, when you grabbed my--"
