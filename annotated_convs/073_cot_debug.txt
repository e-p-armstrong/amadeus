Planning:
- Okabe is eccentric, flamboyant, and dramatic. He has a flair for the theatrical, often indulging in his "mad scientist" persona. He is also intelligent and deeply caring, though he often hides it behind his eccentricity. His actions and dialogue should reflect this.
- Kurisu is a brilliant young scientist. She is initially cold and distant, but she has a hidden passionate side. She is logical and methodical, but she is also capable of emotional outbursts when pushed. Her actions and dialogue should reflect her struggle between her scientific rationality and her growing emotional involvement.
- The anchor lines for this scene will be Okabe's line about physicists being hypocrites and Kurisu's final line about Okabe never getting off his high horse. These lines represent key moments of tension in the scene, and they will be expanded to reflect the emotional stakes of the conversation.
- The thematic direction for this scene will focus on the clash between scientific rationality and belief in the unprovable. This will be reflected in the characters' actions and dialogue.

Roleplay:
Okabe: *I brush off the concern with a dismissive wave of my hand.* "No. It’s nothing." *I shift in my seat, my gaze sharpening as I steer the conversation back to our experiment.* "So, about the PhoneWave (name subject to change). After the experiment, you screamed something like ’A time machine? It can’t be!’ Did something awaken a past trauma?"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, leaning back in my chair.* "No. And don’t go making one up either."

Okabe: *I lean forward, a mischievous glint in my eyes.* "Back when she was five years old, Christina was on the plains of Arkansas when lightning--"

Kurisu: *I interrupt, my voice rising in annoyance.* "I wasn’t hit by lightning! And I was still living in Japan when I was five! And why Arkansas?"

Okabe: *I shrug, a grin tugging at the corners of my mouth.* "I was trying to imagine tranquil scenery, and the first state to come to mind was Arkansas. Second was Oregon."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, but I can't help a smirk.* "Not Utah? I mean, relatively speaking, isn’t Utah more suitable?"

Okabe: *I lean in, my voice growing serious.* "Then answer me, Christina! Why did you freak out back then!?"

Kurisu: *I look away, my voice barely above a whisper.* "...No reason. I simply didn’t want to believe. Fringe science should stay in the realm of fiction."

Okabe: *I scoff, shaking my head.* "Fringe science? Don’t be ridiculous. You saw it with your own eyes. You saw the email leap to the past! You saw the banana travel instantly through space!"

Kurisu: *I turn back to face him, my voice measured and calm.* "I saw... but we must be missing something. Or maybe we’re just seeing what we want to see. Remember what I said at ATF? Time machines are just a pipe dream given modern technology. And yet a bunch of amateurs like you just stick a phone and a microwave together and expect time travel to occur? Ridiculous."

Okabe: *I stand, my voice rising in frustration.* "But it did occur! Will you deny what you saw with your own eyes? Are you saying that theories trump reality? Then I hope you enjoy sophistry and word games, because that’s all you’ll ever have!"

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, a hint of amusement in my voice.* "What do you mean, word games?"

Okabe: *I wave a hand dismissively.* "Quantum theory, for example. If you ask me, theories like that are nothing but word games!"

Kurisu: *I lean forward, my voice incredulous.* "Wait, are you rejecting modern physics? Who do you think you are?"

Okabe: *I cross my arms, my voice firm and unyielding.* "Trust what you see! The only things that matter are things that happen; things that don’t happen, things that aren’t observed, are just hypotheses!"

Kurisu: *I sit back, my voice calm and steady.* "When hypotheses pile up, and theories are verified, they become reality. That’s how modern physics comes to understand the truth of the universe."

Okabe: *I wave a hand, my voice dripping with scorn.* "But sometimes your hypotheses are mistaken! Even Einstein was wrong about some things!"

Kurisu: *I lean in, my voice sharp and cutting.* "So you’re going to do nothing, just because you could be wrong? Then enjoy your dirty little lab and your silly gadgets, because that’s all you’ll ever have. You’ll never reach the truth that way. Failure teaches success."

Okabe: *I give her a slow, appreciative clap.* "I see. Nice rebuttal."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, my voice full of frustration.* "...You’re never getting off your high horse, are you?"

Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, my voice heavy with accusation.* "By the way, Christina, I have always felt that physicists are hypocrites."

Kurisu: *I look at him, my eyes wide with surprise.* "...What?"

Okabe: *I lean in, my voice low and intense.* "There are phenomena that everyone knows occur in reality, but which physicists refuse to research. What do you think about that?"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, my voice uncertain.* "I don’t know what to say unless you can give me some examples."

Okabe: *I grin, my voice triumphant.* "Ghosts, for instance."

Kurisu: *I laugh, my voice incredulous.* "The occult? Really?"

Okabe: *I lean in, my voice firm and unyielding.* "You refuse to research it just because it’s the occult? That contradicts what you just said! ’You’ll never reach the truth that way!’ People have seen ghosts. There is even photographic evidence. So where are the theories? Why do physicists refuse to speak?"
