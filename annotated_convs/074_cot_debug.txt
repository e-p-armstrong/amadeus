Okabe: *I sigh, rubbing the bridge of my nose in frustration.* "Can't you think of anything easier to change and observe?"

Mayuri: "Hmm..." *She hums thoughtfully, slurping her ramen as she considers my question.*

Okabe: "...Let's use that canned ramen." *I gesture towards her meal, a spark of inspiration in my eyes.* 

Okabe: "You'll send a D-Mail to yourself one hour ago. Type 'I wanna eat canned oden' or something like that." *I suggest, my hands moving animatedly as I explain the plan.*

Kurisu: *She raises an eyebrow skeptically.* "I don't think that's enough to convince her to--"

Mayuri: "Oh, that might work!" *Mayuri interjects, her eyes lighting up with excitement.*

Kurisu: "Eh...?" *She blinks in surprise, taken aback by Mayuri's sudden enthusiasm.*

Mayuri: "When I went to the vending machine today, I spent ten minutes wondering if I should get canned oden or canned ramen. It was really hard!" *She pouts, her brows furrowed as she recalls the difficult decision.*

Okabe: "So a little push should be enough to make you choose canned oden! Alright, let's go with that!" *I exclaim, clapping my hands together in satisfaction.*

Mayuri: "Okay! But before we change the past, I gotta finish this ramen first." *She grins, picking up her chopsticks and starting to shovel the ramen into her mouth.*

Kurisu: "What happens if you don't finish it?" *She asks, her curiosity piqued.*

Mayuri: "It'll go to wasteâ™ª" *She replies cheerfully, her mouth full of noodles.*

Kurisu: "Oh... of course. Ahaha..." *She laughs awkwardly, clearly unsure of how to respond.*

Okabe: *Ignoring their exchange, I start prepping the PhoneWave (name subject to change) for D-Mail.* "PhoneWave (name subject to change), activate!" 

Mayuri: "Aw... I haven't sent it yet..." *She pouts, her fingers still hovering over the keyboard.*

Kurisu: "So one second isn't enough for the discharge to occur. That's what I expected, but it's good to have proof." *She muses, jotting down notes in her notebook.*

Itaru: "What if you try warming it up beforehand?" *He suggests, his eyes lighting up with the idea.*

Kurisu: "Warming it up?" *She raises an eyebrow, clearly intrigued by Itaru's suggestion.*

Itaru: "One second isn't enough, right? So just run the microwave for about 30 seconds without sending a mail. As soon as it's done, run it again with the timer set at one second. That should cause the discharge, right?"

Kurisu: "Any basis for that?" *She challenges, her gaze sharp.*

Itaru: "Nope." *He shrugs nonchalantly.*

Okabe: "Damn. Mayuri, got anything else!?" *I turn to Mayuri, my hope resting on her input.*

Mayuri: "Um, well... we could change the flavor of rice ball I bought last night..." *She suggests, her face scrunching up in thought.*

Okabe: "Do you remember what kind of rice ball you ate last night?" *I ask, my eyebrows raised in skepticism.*

Mayuri: "Smoked tuna." *She replies confidently, nodding to herself.*

Kurisu: *She blinks in disbelief.* "She remembers!?"
