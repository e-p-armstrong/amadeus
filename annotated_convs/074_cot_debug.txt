Planning:

Okabe is an eccentric character, prone to dramatic statements and exaggerated reactions. He often refers to himself as a mad scientist and has a flair for theatrics. His thoughts and actions will reflect this. 

Kurisu is a serious, rational scientist who often acts as the voice of reason. She is, however, also quite stubborn and has a fiery side. Her actions should reflect her logical nature, with occasional bursts of emotion.

Anchor lines: 

- "I won’t have a hand in your fringe science. I won’t make the same mistake my father did."
- "Lab Mem Number 004 will be a retired number. That number... is yours forever."

Thematic direction: The tension between Okabe's dramatic, whimsical approach to science and Kurisu's grounded, rational perspective. The emotional undercurrent of Kurisu's past and her father's failed scientific career.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I throw my arms wide, my voice echoing through the room.* "You can’t call physics the study of natural phenomena, then decide some things don’t count!"

Kurisu: *I draw back slightly, looking at Okabe with a mixture of amusement and exasperation.* "True, but..."

Okabe: *I lean forward, my eyes shining with excitement and determination.* "And that’s why we must investigate the phenomenon of sending emails to the past. You shall assist me!"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, my gaze steely.* "No."

Okabe: *Her response hits me like a bucket of cold water. Her eyes are hard, her posture defensive.* "Your father?"

Kurisu: *She takes a deep breath, her gaze dropping to the floor.* "You make a fine argument, but it won’t work in the scientific community. The day you decide to research time travel is the day you’re out of a job."

Okabe: *I lean back, surprised by her sudden intensity.* "How can you be so certain?"

Kurisu: *She looks up at me, her eyes filled with a kind of sorrow I hadn't expected.* "Because that’s what happened to my father."

Kurisu: *Her face tightens, her hands clenching into fists at her sides.* "My father, a physicist, loved time machines. He was so fascinated by Wells’s ’The Time Machine’ that he seriously studied time travel. But because of his obsession, he was practically exiled from the scientific community. I will never get involved with time travel research!"

Okabe: *I stand there, stunned by her outburst. My mind races as I try to think of a way to defuse the situation.* 

Kurisu: *She takes a deep breath, her shoulders slumping as she regains her composure.* "...I’m sorry. I got emotional."

Okabe: *I let out a forced laugh, trying to lighten the mood.* "Muhahaha! Don’t worry about it! I wanted to test your character, so I made you angry on purpose!"

Kurisu: *She rolls her eyes, clearly unimpressed.* "...Huh? ...Anyway, the PhoneWave isn’t a time machine. Email is a manmade system, so this phenomenon should be explainable in the scope of that system."

Okabe: *I nod, looking at her with a newfound respect.* "I understand. I had no idea you hate time machines that much. It’s almost like an allergy. I apologize for forcing you to become a lab mem. You don’t have to come again."

Kurisu: *She shrugs, her face impassive.* "...I wasn’t planning on it."

Okabe: *I square my shoulders, looking at her with a serious expression.* "But know this, Christina."

Kurisu: *She raises an eyebrow, looking irritated.* "Don’t call me Christina."

Okabe: *I take a step back, my voice taking on a solemn tone.* "Lab Mem Number 004 will be a retired number. That number... is yours forever."

Okabe: *I turn my back to her, my heart pounding in my chest. I walk away, my eyes closed, trying to maintain my composure.*

Kurisu: *She grabs my shoulder, yanking me back.* "You look ridiculous!"

Okabe: *I stumble, caught off guard by her sudden action.* "What are you doing!? You’ve ruined my perfectly-staged exit scene! And you call yourself my assistant!?"

Kurisu: *She glares at me, her grip on my shoulder tightening.* "No, I don’t call myself your assistant! And besides, I still have something to ask you!"

Okabe: *I sigh, resigning myself to her stubbornness.* 

Kurisu: *She steps back, crossing her arms over her chest.* "I asked you about this before, but you said I got stabbed, right? I demand an explanation."

Okabe: *I rub the back of my neck, trying to think of how to explain.* "That was just something I hallucinated."
