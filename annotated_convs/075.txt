Kurisu: *I furrow my brows, curiosity and confusion evident in my voice.* "Why would you dream about me?"

Okabe: *I shrug, the corners of my lips curving into a smirk.* "I don’t know. And it wasn’t a dream. It was a hallucination."

Kurisu: *I tilt my head, trying to piece together his words.* "You said something about Doctor Nakabachi, didn’t you?"

Okabe: *I nod, recalling the vivid details of my hallucination.* "Doctor Nakabachi held a time machine presentation at Radi-Kan that day."

Kurisu: *I correct him sharply.* "That presentation was canceled because of the satellite crash."

Okabe: *I sigh, running a hand through my hair.* "So it seems. But in my hallucination, the presentation proceeded as planned. Mayuri and I went to see it, and you came over to flirt with me."

Kurisu: *I scoff, crossing my arms over my chest.* "I don’t flirt. Especially not with idiots like you."

Okabe: *I wave a dismissive hand, a teasing smirk on my lips.* "Like I said, it wasn’t real, okay? No... maybe this world is what isn’t real. That would explain the riddle of the PhoneWave (name subject to change). If this world is some kind of simulation, then we can disregard the laws of physics."

Kurisu: *I narrow my eyes, my voice laced with skepticism.* "Escapism? That’s unexpectedly chicken of you."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, leaning back with a grin.* "It’s a hypothesis. Your favorite thing."

Kurisu: *I stare at him, a frown tugging at my lips.* "So who stabbed me? Don’t tell me it was you."

Okabe: *A chill runs down my spine as I recall the sight of Kurisu collapsed in a puddle of blood. The memory is too vivid, too real. I can still remember the metallic scent of blood.* "You were already dead when I got there. I didn’t see who did it."

Kurisu: *I shake my head, confusion etched on my face.* "I don’t get it. Why do I have to die in your mind? You have something against me?"

Okabe: *I quickly deny, holding my hands up in defense.* "Of course not. At that point in time, we had only spoken once. We were just strangers."

Okabe: *I pause, my gaze drifting away.* "Anyway, we didn’t know each other. That’s why I ran away instead of calling for an ambulance."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, my tone dripping with sarcasm.* "My hero."

Okabe: *I chuckle, leaning in closer with a teasing smile.* "What? You want me to go back in time and give you CPR or something? I’d need to use the PhoneWave (name subject to change) for that."

Kurisu: *I sigh, rubbing my temples in exasperation.* "...I’ve heard enough. No more hallucinating about me, okay? Dying isn’t fun, even if it’s in someone else’s head."

Okabe: *I smirk, folding my arms over my chest.* "I can’t make any guarantees. That would require perfect 24-hour surveillance inside my brain."

Kurisu: *I shake my head, a small smile playing on my lips.* "You have a comeback for everything, don’t you."

Okabe: *Watching as she turns and starts walking off, I quickly reach out and grab her shoulder.* "Kyah! What now!?"

Okabe: *I hold onto her, my voice firm.* "I’m not done talking!"

Kurisu: *I turn around, glaring at him.* "You trying to pick a fight?"

Okabe: *I laugh, pointing a finger at her.* "It’s revenge for ruining my farewell scene, Christina! You shall regret your thoughtless actions!"

Kurisu: *I sigh, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Okay, okay, fine. What is it?"

Okabe: *I lean in closer, dropping my voice to a whisper.* "About the IBN 5100."

Kurisu: *I shake my head, a puzzled look on my face.* "I don’t know what you’re talking about."

Okabe: *I shrug, releasing her shoulder.* "...If you don’t know, then forget about it. Farewell! We will not meet again."
