Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, my eyes wide with confusion.* "Um, Okarin? Mayushii doesn’t know what that means..."

Okabe: *I pinch the bridge of my nose, a sigh escaping my lips.* "I’m asking why you’re calling."

Mayuri: *My face lights up with understanding and I giggle softly.* "Why didn’t you just say that? Um, what are you doing now?"

Okabe: *I straighten up, my voice firm and determined.* "Executing the mission."

Mayuri: *I blink, my lips forming a small 'o' as I mishear him.* "Executing the missus?"

Okabe: *I groan, rubbing my temples.* "The mission! I’m looking for an IBN 5100!"

Mayuri: *I giggle again, my eyes twinkling with amusement.* "Ehehe! Well why didn’t you say so? Mayushii heard something amazing just now. Wanna hear?"

Okabe: *I pause, my heart rate increasing slightly at the prospect of valuable information.* "If it’s valuable information, then by all means."

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes wide and bright with anticipation.* "Well, then come to MayQueen! I’ll be waiting♪"

Okabe: *I let out a frustrated sigh, feeling the phone grow warm against my ear.* "Hey, tell me over the phone! Hey, Mayuri! Why do I have to go all the way to MayQueen..." *Despite my complaints, I find myself standing and heading for the door. After all, it's just a ten minute walk and I could do with some lunch.*

Mayuri: *I spot Okarin from the corner of my eye and wave excitedly.* "Okarin!" *I rush towards him, a convenience store bag swinging in my hand.*

Mayuri: *I beam at Okarin, holding up my pocket watch.* "Mayushii went to the convenience store during lunch break. Now there’s only five minutes left!" *I plop down next to the stairs, setting down my bag.*

Okabe: *I nod, my eyes flicking to the bag of food.* "Good work. So, what was that amazing thing you heard?"

Mayuri: *I rummage through the bag, pulling out a box of fried chicken.* "Before that, food." *The aroma of the chicken fills the air, making my stomach rumble.*

Okabe: *My mouth waters at the sight of the fried chicken.* "Let me have one."

Mayuri: *I skewer a piece of chicken on a toothpick and hold it out for him with a bright smile.* "Okay. Here you go♪"

Okabe: *I frown, glancing around the front of the store.* "You can’t do that in front of the store. You’re supposed to be a maid. Here, you’re not Shiina Mayuri, but Mayushii NyanNyan. You can’t ’say aah’ in front of the store! Your customers are going to see that as an act of betrayal."

Mayuri: *I blink, surprise etched on my face.* "Oh! Mayushii didn’t think of that." *I watch as Okarin takes the chicken off the toothpick and throws it into his mouth.*

Okabe: *I savor the taste of the chicken, my mind still focused on the task at hand.* "Well? What was that amazing thing you heard?"

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, excitement bubbling within me.* "Oh, right! Actually, it’s about the IBN 5100."

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat, anticipation coursing through me.* "You found a lead!? Of course, it was at MayQueen! I can’t believe I missed it!"

Mayuri: *I shake my head, a triumphant smile on my face.* "No it’s not! That’s silly!" *I continue to explain how I asked the other girls at work about the IBN 5100, my voice filled with enthusiasm.*
