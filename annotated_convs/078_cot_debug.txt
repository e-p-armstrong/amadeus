Okabe: *I quickly check the new email, my heart pounding in my chest.* "...Ha, haha." *I let out a breathy laugh, relief washing over me.*

Kurisu: "Explain what happened, Okabe." *She demands, her eyebrows furrowing in concern.*

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, trying to collect my thoughts.* "What do you mean?"

Kurisu: "I don't know the details, but when the past changed, Kiryu-san's actions these past four days changed ever so slightly. As a result, the timeline was reconfigured so that Moeka-san didn't come to the lab today." *She explains, her fingers tapping thoughtfully on the table.*

Itaru: "Is that even possible?" *He asks, leaning forward with a perplexed look on his face.*

Kurisu: "I don't know. If the fact that the D-Mail was sent is undone, then it becomes a paradox of who sent that D-Mail... And there's one other thing that I don't understand." *She pauses, her gaze focusing on me.*

Okabe: "What?" *I ask, leaning back in my chair.*

Kurisu: "What you call Reading Steiner. By the way, you should quit it with that name. It's stupid." *She says, her lips curling into a smirk.*

Okabe: "Hmph, I didn't ask for your opinion." *I cross my arms over my chest, a playful grin on my face.*

Kurisu: "By your explanation, you neither sent nor received the D-Mail. Yet how come you're the only one who remembers what happened before the worldline changed? What if it's all in your head?" *She questions, tilting her head to the side curiously.*

Itaru: "Like an imaginary girlfriend. I get it." *He chuckles, leaning back in his chair.*

Okabe: "No you don't. I'm not a 'gentleman perv' like you, creating imaginary relationships." *I retort, pointing a finger accusingly at him.*

Kurisu: "Maybe this Kiryu-san never existed. Or maybe Kiryu-san does exist, but the fact that she sent a D-Mail was something you made--" *She begins, only to be cut off by my sudden cry of pain.*

Okabe: "Gwaaaah!" *I fall to my knees, clutching at my left eye.*

Mayuri: "Okarin, are you okay?" *She asks, her eyes wide with worry.*

Okabe: "No, Mayuri! S-stay away! I don't... want to hurt you!" *I push her away gently.*

Itaru: "...He's messing with us, right?" *He asks, glancing at Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "Y-yeah..." *She agrees, although her eyes were still focused on me with concern.*

Okabe: "I-I'm okay... This aching is normal... it'll end soon! As long as I have this magic eye... the Organization will keep coming after me! It's the power to see across time and space... but at the same time, it's a double-edged sword! Because of this all-seeing eye... I have lost my connection to causality. I drift alone in the space between worlds. But even so... I swore to protect this lab! So quiet thy fury, Reading Steiner! Your time will come... but not yet." *I kneel, pressing my forehead against the cold floor.*

Mayuri: "Okarin? Does it hurt?" *She asks, rubbing my back gently.*

Okabe: "No... I'm okay now." *I assure her, pushing myself off the floor.*

Kurisu: "W-what? That was just an act, right?" *She stammers, her eyes wide with surprise.*

Okabe: "You are wrong, Christina. Our experiments have already proven... That I... That my Reading Steiner is genuine!" *I declare, shooting her a sharp glare.*

Kurisu: "Fine, I get it. You're a chuunibyou patient." *She sighs, rolling her eyes.*

Okabe: *I turn to look at Itaru and Mayuri, who were both looking at Kurisu with confusion.* "Ah... Wh-why are you all staring at me? Don't look at me!" *She exclaims, blushing furiously.*
