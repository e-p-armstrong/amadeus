Planning Stage:

In this scene, we have four characters: Mayuri, Okabe, Faris and the UNSPOKEN which is essentially Okabe's inner thoughts and actions. 

Mayuri is a sweet, somewhat naive character who is often more concerned with simple pleasures, like eating chicken, than the intense situations around her. Her actions should reflect this, with her focusing on her food and not understanding the gravity of the situation.

Okabe is the eccentric and dramatic self-proclaimed mad scientist. He tends to overreact and overthink, often speaking in a grandiose and theatrical manner. His actions should reflect his flamboyant nature and paranoia.

Faris is a lively, eccentric and playful character. She often speaks in a cutesy manner and adds "nya" (the Japanese onomatopoeic sound for a cat's meow) to her sentences. Her actions should reflect her playful, energetic personality.

The anchor lines for this scene will be Okabe's dramatic monologues to himself on his phone. I will enhance these to further highlight Okabe's theatrical nature and paranoia. 

Roleplay:

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, thinking for a moment before smiling brightly.* "Hm? Um, well, I think Feris-chan knows."

Okabe: *My eyes widen, and I feel my heart pounding in my chest.* "What!? Is that true!?"

Mayuri: *I nod, my eyes wide with excitement.* "Yup. Did you know she’s a retro PC maniac?"

Okabe: *I blink, surprise etched onto my face.* "Faris?"

*I can hardly believe it. That girl is seriously hardcore. I’d prefer to stay away from her if possible. But I’m really desperate for information. I take out my phone, my fingers dancing over the keys before I put it to my ear.*

Okabe: "It’s me. Looks like we’ve got a lead on the IBN 5100. Are you ready for this? It’s Faris NyanNyan. It turns out that catgirl’s an expert on retro PCs. There’s probably another side to this. Let’s keep our eyes peeled. ...Hmph. I suppose I’m the only man for the job. Very well. I’ll make the approach. If you don’t hear from me by 2000 hours tonight, then forget about me and commence the strike on MayQueen. Everything is the choice of Steins Gate... El Psy Kongroo."

*I put away my phone, my hand reaching out to grab another piece of chicken. I glance up at MayQueen’s window, my heart pounding in anticipation.*

Mayuri: *I gasp, my eyes wide with surprise and a hint of betrayal.* "Ahh! I didn’t say you could have two!"

Okabe: *I grin, popping the chicken into my mouth.* "Well done, Mayuri! I’ll see that your information is put to good use!"

Mayuri: *My eyes well up with tears as I gaze at my dwindling chicken supply.* "My chicken..."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, curiosity piqued.* "By the way, what’s this Feris Cup about?"

Mayuri: *I whimper, clutching the last piece of chicken tightly.* "My chicken..."

*I watch as Mayuri stuffs the remaining chicken into her mouth as fast as she can. There are tears in her eyes. Come on, it was just two.*

Okabe: "Well, whatever. I’m uneasy about the lack of intel, but the mission must go on. Wait here, Mayuri. If I don’t return within the hour, go home immediately. Understood?"

Mayuri: *I shake my head, my mouth full of chicken.* "I can’t! I have to work."

*I sigh, leaving Mayuri to her chicken and begin the approach.*

Faris: *I beam, welcoming the new customer with a cheer.* "Welcome, Myaster♪"

*When I enter the cafe, it’s fully occupied, unlike usual.*

Faris: "Nyanya♪ Is Kyouma gonna join too? Today’s the Faris Cup, nya!"

*She doesn’t seem to plan on explaining what that is. I take out my phone again, ready to dive into the unknown.*

Okabe: "It’s me. Run a search on the Faris Cup. ...What!? A battle to the death where the winner gets to use Faris however he pleases!? Looks like I’ve stepped into one hell of a mess. ...No, there’s no problem. I’ll survive... by any means necessary. El Psy Kongroo."

*I put away my phone and turn to Faris, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Okabe: "The Faris Cup is a battle royale, isn’t it?"

Faris: *I giggle, my eyes sparkling with excitement.* "No, nya. It’s a cat-eat-cat battle royale where the winner gets to make Faris his slave, nya. Ahh, no, you can’t! You can’t claw at each other’s throats over Faris, nya! Please, stop nya!"
