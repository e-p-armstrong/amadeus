Okabe: *I scan the room, my eyes darting from one person to another, my heartbeat echoing in my ears.* "Don’t worry. There’s nobody for me to stop. Everyone’s sitting silently in their seats." *Even as I say it, a shiver runs down my spine. The atmosphere here is different. I sense bloodlust in the air.*

Okabe: *I furrow my brows, a deep crease forming between them as I try to understand what she's saying.* "No, seriously, what’s the Faris Cup?"

Faris: *I twirl a strand of my hair, my lips curling into a sly smile.* "A paw-to-paw contest with Faris nya. Faris goes at it with everyone at the same time nyan. A reward goes to those Faris finds worthy, nya."

Okabe: *I gulp, feeling a knot tighten in my throat. My eyes lock onto Faris, trying to decipher her playful demeanor.* "Faris, are you serious!?" *A surge of disbelief washes over me. Going at it with all these men at the same time? She’s insane. But Faris grins. A fang-like tooth peeks out from her glistening red lips.*

Faris: *I approach Okabe, my slender fingers gently grazing his arm.* "...If you don’t do something, Faris is gonna become everyone’s plaything, nya." *I touch him lightly, my eyes sparkling with mischief.*

Okabe: *I can’t take my eyes off her. I’ve been entranced. This girl has the power to bend men to her will. I must resist.* "I refuse!"

Faris: "NyaNya!?" *I pull my paws back, my eyes wide with surprise.*

Okabe: *I shake her paws off, my heart pounding in my chest. Phew, that was close. She has one hell of an evil eye. I barely escaped enticement, and only because I am the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma.* "I didn’t come to fight. I only came to talk to you."

Faris: *I pout, crossing my arms over my chest.* "If you’re not going to play, then I’m sorry, but I’ll have to ask you to leave, nya."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a smirk playing on my lips.* "What’s this? A maid, sending a customer away?"

Faris: *I stand tall, my gaze unwavering.* "Faris is the organyaizer of the Faris Cup today. Only participants are allowed inside the shop, nya."

Okabe: "I only need two minutes. The IBN--"

Faris: "Not listening, nyan!" *I place my hands over my ears, my real ears, not the cat ears. Then I laugh mischievously.*

Faris: *I lean in closer, my voice dropping to a whisper.* "If you want to talk to Faris, you have no choice but to join the Faris Cup, nyan." *I pull back, my eyes twinkling with amusement.*

Okabe: "...Now that’s just low." *I mutter, my fingers drumming on the table.*

Faris: *I tilt my head, my lips curling into a playful grin.* "So, what’ll it be nyan? You can’t survive unless you fight with your own paws, nyan!" 

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, steeling myself for the challenge ahead. Use any method to obtain information. That’s my current mission. I have to do it! No matter what lies ahead!* "There’s no choice. I accept your challenge. But on one condition." *I thrust my finger at the tip of Faris’ nose.*

Okabe: "If I face you, you’ll tell me everything you know!"

Faris: "NyaNya? Well, fine by me nya... Well then, Master, this way, nyannyan♪" *I beckon him with a wave of my hand, leading him towards the battlefield.*
