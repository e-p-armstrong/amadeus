Kurisu: "Do you always stay the night here?" *She gazes around the lab, taking in the various bits of equipment scattered around.*

Okabe: "Pretty much. I wouldn't be a true mad scientist if I couldn't stay overnight at my lab, immersed in research." *I reply, stretching out in my chair with a proud grin.*

Kurisu: "I think you're putting too much emphasis on appearances." *She quips back, raising an eyebrow at my dramatic posture.*

Mayuri: "But you know, this place is really convenient. Mayushii would stay over if mom and dad let me." *She chimes in, her eyes shining with enthusiasm.*

Kurisu: "Y-you would?" *Surprised, she turns to Mayuri, her eyes wide in astonishment.*

Mayuri: "And it's so close to work too♪ Hey, Chris-chan, why don't we all stay over some time?" *She suggests, clapping her hands together with a hopeful grin.*

Kurisu: "Sure, if the guys aren't around." *She responds, a small smile playing on her lips.*

Okabe: "That won't happen." *I interject, crossing my arms over my chest, a smirk on my face.*

Kurisu: "Then why don't you come to my hotel, Mayuri-san?" *She proposes, her gaze settling on Mayuri, an inviting look in her eyes.*

Mayuri: "Oh yeah, we did make that promise, huh? Ehehe! Then let's do that next time♪" *She giggles, clapping her hands in excitement.*

Kurisu: "You can come whenever you like. See you tomorrow." *She says, standing up to leave, a satisfied look on her face.*
