Okabe: *I whirl around, surprise etched on my face at the unexpected sight of Daru.* "Wha, Daru!? What are you doing here!? What about SERN!?"

Itaru: *I raise my hands in a placating gesture, a small smile playing on my lips.* "Let me rest for one day, man. You should treat me better after two consecutive all-nighters."

Okabe: *I grimace, my gaze flicking around the room nervously.* "SERN’s power grows stronger by the day, and here you are without a care in the world."

Itaru: *I shrug, my eyes twinkling with amusement.* "You’re here too."

Okabe: *I huff, crossing my arms over my chest defensively.* "I came here for an unrelated matter and got dragged into this nonsense. I’m not interested in RaiNet or Faris’s home cooking."

*With the last words leaving my lips, I feel the eyes of everyone in the café on me. They're glaring, their eyes promising a blood feud. I realize, too late, that I'm the Away Team in a sea of Faris fans. Tch, I’m surrounded by enemies. But this is a battle I must win, for the sake of the IBN 5100.*

Okabe: *I lean in closer to Daru, my voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.* "Daru, Operation Sigma."

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, my curiosity piqued.* "What’s that?"

Okabe: *I lean back, a smug grin spreading across my face.* "I’m saying we should cooperate. We’ll be the strongest if we team up, right?"

Itaru: *I chuckle, shaking my head.* "More like you’re gonna drag me down. You’re a noob at this game, Okarin."

Okabe: *I scowl, my hands balling into fists at my sides.* "But you’re my right-hand man. As long as we’re together, we have nothing to fear."

*Daru's grin widens, his teeth shining in the café's dim light.*

Itaru: *I chuckle, shaking my head.* "But I refuse. I’m in this thing to win."

Okabe: *I recoil, my heart sinking.* "And you call yourself my friend!?"

Itaru: *I shrug, a playful smirk on my face.* "In this tournament, we’re enemies."

Okabe: *I gasp, my hand clenching into a fist.* "You traitor! Why do you think I sent you into this cafe as a spy?"

Itaru: *I shake my head, my smirk widening.* "But you didn’t send me. I’m Faris-tan’s biggest fan. I check her blog every day and--"

*The café's lights suddenly dim, the soft melody of a familiar song filling the room. A spotlight illuminates Faris, who stands at the center of the room with a smile on her face.*

Faris: *I twirl under the spotlight, a wide smile on my face.* "Hi everyone♪ Thanks for waiting, nyan! The afternoon Faris Cup is about to begin nya!"

*The room erupts in cheers, everyone raising their fists in anticipation.*

Faris: *I wave at the crowd, my heart swelling with gratitude.* "Thank you, nya!"

*After the cheers die down, I clear my throat, the anticipation in the room almost palpable.*

Faris: *I raise my hands, my voice echoing throughout the café.* "The rules are simple. Faris will face off against each one of you nya. Faris will even go paw-to-paw with ten people at once, nyan. If you beat Faris, you’ll get her home cooking as a reward, nya. Now then, everyone! Enjoy the contest!"
