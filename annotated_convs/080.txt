Okabe: "Whew... Lukako. Foolish disciple of mine." *I point towards a costume and a sword named Samidare, my tone filled with theatrical seriousness.* "From now on, you shall go into battle equipped with that costume and Samidare."

Luka: "Eh..." *He stammers, his eyes wide with surprise.*

Mayuri: "Ehh? Kirari-chan doesn't have a sword!" *Mayuri cheerfully chimes in, her eyes sparkling with excitement.* "He should carry an Upa instead♪" *She hands Luka an Upa cushion, grinning.*

Okabe: "The Organization is making a move on Akiba." *I look away, pretending not to see Luka's distress.*

Okabe: "You are the guardian who protects this chaotic metropolis. Miko of Yanabayashi Shrine, now is the time for you to fulfill that duty!" *I thrust a finger towards him, trying to instill a sense of purpose.* "Understand, Lukako? This is the reason I'm so hard on you. You have a duty to protect this town!"

Luka: "Do I... really?" *He asks, his voice barely above a whisper.*

Okabe: "You certainly do!" *I laugh loudly, my voice echoing in the room.* "Muhahaha!"

Kurisu: "Can you stop that vulgar laughter?" *She walks into the lab, her face pinched in annoyance.* "I can hear you from outside. It's embarrassing."

Mayuri: "Chris-chan, tutturu♪" *She greets Kurisu with a cheerful wave.*

Okabe: "Mmgh!? You come here this late and dare insult me?" *I sputter in disbelief.* "And you call yourself my assistant!?"

Kurisu: "I'm not your assistant. Don't make me repeat myself." *She crosses her arms, glaring at me.* "Anyway! You're the worst, toying with such a weak and innocent girl. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?"

Itaru: "Toying with a weak and innocent girl, you say?" *He smirks, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively.*

Kurisu: "Don't react to every little thing, you perv." *She shoots a glare at Itaru, then turns her attention back to Luka.*

Okabe: "Christina. Stop eying Lukako's entire body from top to bottom like that." *I warn her, trying to protect Luka from her prying eyes.*

Kurisu: "I-I wasn't doing that!" *She stammers, her cheeks flushing a bright red.*

Mayuri: "Do you like the costume, Chris-chan?" *Mayuri asks, her eyes sparkling with excitement.* "It really suits Luka-kun, dontcha think?"

Kurisu: "Is this that cosplay thing I've heard about? It's part of Japanimation culture, right? You're very cute." *She praises, her gaze softening as she looks at Luka.*

Luka: "C-c-cute? No way..." *He stutters, his eyes filling with tears.*

Kurisu: "Why are you crying?" *She asks, confusion clear on her face.* "You look perfect, so you should be more confident."

Okabe: "Heh heh heh..." *I chuckle, combing back my hair with my fingers.* "Lukako! Tell us your wish."

Luka: "Eh...?" *He blinks, taken aback by my sudden question.*

Kurisu: "That's one hell of an acrobatic topic change." *She comments, her eyebrows raised in surprise.*

Okabe: "Listen, Lukako! Your desires can become reality. Japan is a land of great spiritual power. It resides in every word that slips from your tongue! Now that you too have joined the otaku world, you need conceal your deepest desires no longer! Speak your wish with a true heart, and by the chaos that rules Akihabara, Steins Gate shall grant it!" *I declare, my voice filled with passion.*

Luka: "My... wish?" *He tilts his head to the side, his cheeks turning a light pink.*

Kurisu: "Well yeah, no wish is embarrassing compared to the idiotic wish for chaos to envelop the world or whatever." *She rolls her eyes, clearly unimpressed by my dramatics.*
