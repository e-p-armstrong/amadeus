Faris: *My fingers dance over the game pieces, dispatching my opponents with ease.* "Nyahaha♪ I hope the next group tries a little harder nyan."

Okabe: *I lean back against the wall, crossing my arms over my chest as I watch the proceedings, my mind racing with strategies and counters.* 

Mayuri: *She returns from her break, a soft drink cradled in her hands, her eyes wide with admiration.* "Feris-chan sure is strong."

Mayuri: *She takes a sip of her drink, her gaze drifting over the game boards.* "Mayushii’s bad at RaiNet, so I’m really jealous."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a smirk playing on my lips.* "What would you do if you were good at it?"

Mayuri: *She tilts her head, her eyes sparkling with innocence.* "Don’t you know? RaiNet AccessBattlers isn’t just popular in Akiba. It’s a global blend!"

Okabe: *I chuckle, shaking my head at her adorable misunderstanding.* "I think you mean trend."

Mayuri: *She nods vigorously, her excitement palpable.* "Yeah, that. So if you get good at it, you’re sure to be every kid’s hero!"

Okabe: *I stroke my chin, considering the idea.* "Hero, huh... That doesn’t sound bad."

Mayuri: *She clasps her hands together, a dreamy look on her face.* "Besides, Upa is so cute♪"

Okabe: *My smirk deepens as I tease her.* "Wait. There’s something strange about your argument. How does RaiNet skill relate to Upa’s cuteness?"

Mayuri: *She shrugs, her smile unwavering.* "Feris-chan’s too busy to go to tournaments, but I think she’s definitely a world-class player."

Okabe: *I nod, looking back at the game boards, my mind already formulating new strategies.* 

Faris: *She stands tall, her eyes glittering with challenge.* "NyanNyan. Sorry, nya, but Faris never pulls punches in RaiNet. I want someone who can go paw-to-paw with me, nyan."

Itaru: *He sighs, running a hand through his hair in exasperation.* "Gwohh! Feris-tan is too strong! We can’t win. It was hopeless from the get-go!"
