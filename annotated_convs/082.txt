Okabe: *I stride to the front of the crowd, my gaze piercing through the anticipation hanging in the air, and meet Faris’s questioning gaze head-on.* "But we’ve been saving the best for last. Daru! Allow me to show you... how a true man fights."

Itaru: *I scratch the back of my head, a skeptical grin playing on my lips.* "Don’t tell me you’ve got a plan?"

Okabe: *I chuckle, a confident smirk lighting up my face.* "Hmph. Indeed I do. Let’s just call this Operation ’Sweet Side’."

Okabe: *I feel a wave of awe ripple through the crowd, their hopes, and dreams now entrusted to me. The weight of their expectations fuels my resolve.* "The tears of the fallen twenty... shall not be in vain. Do you remember our promise, Faris? Once this match is over, you’ll tell me everything you know."

Itaru: *I can't help but laugh, shaking my head in disbelief.* "Amazing! That crazy bastard actually means to win!"

Mayuri: *I clasp my hands together, my voice chiming with excitement.* "Go for it, Okarin♪"

Okabe: *Feeling the crowd's energy surge, I step up to the table, a determined glint in my eye.* "Five minutes. That’s all it will take to decide the match."

Faris: *I giggle, my cat-like eyes sparkling with anticipation.* "Okay! Round 3, start nya♪ RaiNet AccesssBattlers, duel access!"

Okabe: *I let out a sigh, my shoulders slumping in defeat.* "I give up."

Itaru: *I groan, burying my face in my hands.* "You’re weak! Too weak!"

Okabe: *I leap onto a chair, striking a dramatic pose, my laughter echoing through the room.* "Muhahaha! Yes! It’s exactly what you’re thinking!"

Okabe: *I throw my head back, laughing maniacally.* "Operation Sweet Side was a suicide attack!"

Itaru: *I shake my head, unable to hold back a chuckle.* "That’s gotta be the worst pun ever!"

Faris: *I tilt my head, a puzzled frown tugging at my lips.* "But why are you so proud even though I made kitty litter outta you, nya?"

Okabe: *I cross my arms, an arrogant smirk playing on my lips.* "Heh heh heh. Have you not figured it out, Faris NyanNyan!? Win or lose, it made no difference."

Faris: *I blink, taken aback by his words.* "What’s that supposed to mean, nya?"

Okabe: *I lean in, my voice dropping to a dramatic whisper.* "Do you remember the conditions I set?"

Faris: *I knit my brows, trying to recall his words.* "Mya? If Faris lost, then she’d tell you everything--"

Okabe: *I interrupt her, my voice booming with triumph.* "No! You are wrong, Faris. What I said was... ’If I face you, you’ll tell me everything you know!’ If I face you. Now do you understand? I never needed to win! No one else could have pulled it off. These fools were lured here by the prospect of Faris’s home cooking. They were obsessed with winning. But not I! Your home cooking meant nothing to me! That difference in motivation is what allowed this suicide mission to succeed! Heh heh heh, muhahahaha, MUHAHAHAHAHA!"
