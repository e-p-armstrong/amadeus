Okabe: *I turn to face Luka, my curiosity piqued.* "Lukako, how serious are you about that wish of yours?"

Luka: "You know those stories where a guy magically turns into a girl overnight? Sometimes I wish that would happen to me. Ahaha... that's stupid, isn't it?" *He looks nervously at the floor, a slight blush coloring his cheeks.*

Mayuri: "Luka-kun, you're so cuteâ™ª" *She coos, clapping her hands together delightedly.*

Kurisu: "S-So cute..." *She mutters under her breath, her eyes softening at Luka's bashful demeanor.*

Kurisu: *Clearing her throat, she draws the attention back to the conversation at hand.* "This reminds me of something I heard once."

Itaru: "Exposition scene, go!" *He chuckles, leaning back in his chair.*

Kurisu: "There's a saying that if you eat a lot of meat when you're pregnant, you'll have a boy, and if you eat a lot of vegetables, you'll have a girl." *She explains, a thoughtful look on her face.*

Itaru: "Source? Minmei Shobou?" *He teases, earning a glare from Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "I saw it on the internet." *She retorts, crossing her arms defensively.*

Itaru: "S-so that's how you reply... well played." *He chuckles, clearly enjoying the banter.*

Mayuri: "Really? I didn't know that. So Mayushii and Chris-chan's moms ate a lot of vegetables?" *She asks, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.*

Okabe: "But what about primitive people who lived on hunting? If that theory is true, then they would have had too many boys and not enough girls. Humanity would never have made it this far." *I challenge, my eyes locked on Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "I never said it was true. I just remembered hearing it somewhere. Don't snap at every little thing." *She counters, her eyes meeting mine defiantly.*

Okabe: "I didn't snap. Christina, feel like verifying that theory?" *I ask, a smirk playing on my lips.*

Kurisu: "...What are you implying?" *She narrows her eyes at me, suspicion creeping into her voice.*

Okabe: "Have you forgotten? We have the PhoneWave (name subject to change)!" *I declare, waving my hand towards the invention for dramatic effect.*

Mayuri: "PhoneWave-chan? It can tell if you'll have a boy or a girl?" *She questions, her head tilting to the side in confusion.*

Kurisu: *A look of realization dawns on her face.* "Wait... of course. We can send a D-Mail to Urushibara-san's mother when she was pregnant."

Okabe: "Indeed. Something like 'Eat more vegetables!'" *I suggest, grinning at the idea.*

Okabe: "You think it's worth a shot?" *I ask, turning to Kurisu, my eyes gleaming with anticipation.*

Kurisu: "Well..." *She hesitates, clearly torn between her scientific curiosity and skepticism towards my idea.*

Okabe: "It's too late to hide behind your goody-two-shoes mask, Christina. Your fate is to become a mad scientist, for you are an experiment-loving girl!" *I exclaim, pointing a finger towards her for emphasis.*

Kurisu: "Who are you calling an experiment-loving girl!?" *She snaps back, her cheeks flushing in indignation.*

Okabe: "Am I wrong?" *I challenge, my grin only widening at her response.*

Kurisu: "N-no, but..." *She stammers, her face a mix of frustration and confusion.*
