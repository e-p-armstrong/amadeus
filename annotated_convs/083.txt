Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes wide and bright with admiration.* "Wow, Okarin! You’re amazing!"

Itaru: *I stammer, my face flushing as I tuck my chin into my chest.* "Th-that’s dirty..."

Okabe: *I laugh, a manic grin spreading across my face as I throw my arms wide.* "I think you mean fiendishly clever! Behold the success of Operation Sweet Side!" *I rise from my chair, my coat swirling around me as I stride towards Faris with a purpose.* "Now, Faris. Answer me. Where is the IBN 5100!?"

Faris: *I tilt my head to the side, a playful smile tugging at the corners of my lips.* "Nya? The IBN 5100?"

Okabe: *My eyes narrow, my fingers tapping against the side of my phone.* "Don’t play dumb. I have a reliable source." *I swipe through my phone, pulling up the image of the IBN 5100 that Shining Finger sent me. I hold it out, thrusting it towards Faris.* "I know that you have information on the IBN 5100."

Faris: *I lean back, raising an eyebrow as I glance at the image.* "Nya... how do you expect me to remember that, nya? Though I think I’ve seen this computer before..."

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat. I turn towards Mayuri, my voice rising in disbelief.* "What!? I thought you were an expert on retro PCs! Mayuri told me so!"

Itaru: *I gulp, my eyes darting between Okabe and Mayuri.* "Uh, you leaked your source..."

Mayuri: *I giggle, twirling a lock of hair around my finger.* "Yup! Mayushii’s a reliable source!"

Faris: *I shrug, my hands spreading out in a casual gesture.* "I’m not an expert, nya. Papa collected them, so we’ve got tons at home, that’s all."

Okabe: *I point at Faris, my voice rising in excitement.* "So that must be where the IBN 5100 is sealed! Take me there at once!"

Faris: *I shake my head, my voice taking on a teasing tone.* "I can’t, nyan."

Okabe: *I blink, my heart pounding in my chest.* "What!? Why!?" 

Faris: *I flash a bewitching smile, my eyes sparkling with mischief.* "Because that’s the Faris Clan’s sanctuary." *My smile fades, replaced by a look of mock horror.* "The only ones who may enter are the Faris Clan’s cat-eared daughters: those who purrsue the knowledge of the meow miko. In other words, it’s paws-off to everybody but Faris, nya. Try to force your way in... and you’ll grow dog ears, nya!"

Okabe: *I sputter, my hands waving in front of me in a frantic gesture.* "Like hell I will! Dog ears!? Yeah right!"

Faris: *I whimper, my hands clasped together in a pleading gesture.* "I-it’s true, nya... Faris doesn’t tell tall tails, nya..."

Okabe: *I take a step back, my eyes darting around the room as I realize I'm surrounded by Faris fans.* "You coward! You’ve converted your believers into your personal army!"

Faris: *I blink, my voice taking on a soft, innocent tone.* "Faris is only telling the truth, nya..." 

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, feeling a wave of dread wash over me as I realize the severity of my situation.* "Gwaahhh!" *I cry out, clutching at my trembling right wrist.* "No, n-not now... it’s too soon!" *I force a look of agony onto my face, my body shaking as I struggle to control the trembling in my hand.*

Faris: *I gasp, my eyes wide with shock.* "No! Don’t tell me! Is the Anti-RaiNet System activating!? I warned you playing RaiNet could kill you!"
