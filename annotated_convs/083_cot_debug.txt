Okabe: "Then that settles it. Lukako, I appoint you Lab Mem 006." *I say, my voice filled with authority.*

Luka: "Eh...?" *He squeaks out, his eyes wide with surprise.*

Okabe: "The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is our lab's most important secret. In order to use it, you must become a lab mem." *I explain, my gaze serious and intense.*

Luka: "Ah! Okay! Actually... I always wanted to be a lab member." *He admits, his cheeks flushing with excitement.*

Mayuri: "Really? You should've just said so!" *She claps her hands together, her eyes shining with enthusiasm.*

Luka: "I didn't have the courage... Like I said, I don't know a thing about gadgets..." *He mumbles, his gaze falling to the floor in embarrassment.*

Mayuri: "You don't have to worry about those things. I mean, Mayuri doesn't get them either." *She reassures Luka, her smile warm and comforting.*

Okabe: "So Lukako shall be a lab mem from this point forth. Any objections?" *I ask, my eyes scanning the room for any dissenters.*

Kurisu: *She raises her hand.* "Here. I want to give Urushibara-san my number so I can retire."

Okabe: "Denied. Anyone else?" *I dismiss her plea without hesitation, my gaze unwavering.*

Kurisu: "...*sigh*" *She lets out a sigh of frustration, her shoulders slumping in defeat.*
