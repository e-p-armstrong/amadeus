Okabe: *I scan the cafe once more, my heart heavy with disappointment.* "Damn, empty handed..."

Okabe: *The sweltering heat of August envelops me as I step outside, my hand instinctively reaching up to wipe the sweat off my brow. My body aches from exhaustion, a stark reminder of the relentless pursuit I've been on.* 

Mayuri: *I hear my name being called out, a familiar voice cutting through the stifling afternoon heat.* "Okarin!" *I quicken my pace, my heart fluttering with a mix of excitement and worry.*

Okabe: *I turn to see Mayuri, her face flushed from the heat, her eyes sparkling with a hint of mischief.* "What happened? Is the Faris Cup already over?"

Mayuri: *I shake my head, a little out of breath from the chase.* "Nope. Well, just about. After this, the customers get to chat with Feris-chan. I wanted to tell you about that IBN 5100 thing. I showed Feris-chan the picture again."

Okabe: *A glimmer of hope ignites in my heart. I muster a smile, my voice laced with a touch of pride.* "Good work, Mayuri! Completely different from a certain useless super hacka! So?"

Mayuri: *I giggle, feeling a sense of accomplishment. I start recounting the story in my usual cheerful tone.* "Feris-chan said it was probably around the time she was in elementary school. On a cold autumn day, while Feris-chan was shivering from the cold, her butler Kuroki-san came to help--"

Okabe: *I cut her off, my patience wearing thin.* "I don’t care about her butler! Just get to the point!"

Mayuri: *I flinch slightly at his tone, but quickly regain my composure.* "So basically, she ended up donating one of her dad’s computers to a shrine. She says it looked just like the one you’re looking for."

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, trying to make sense of the odd combination.* "Donated it... to a shrine?"

Okabe: *My mind races, trying to find the connection between consumer electronics and ancient Shinto rituals. It's a puzzling yet intriguing lead.*

Okabe: *I look at Mayuri, my eyes filled with anticipation.* "Which shrine?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head in confusion, my brow furrowed in thought.* "Dunno. Where could it be?"

Okabe: *I sigh, a little frustrated at the missing piece of the puzzle.* "Whatever. It’s a lead."

Okabe: *I mentally list the possible shrines in Akiba, determined to find the missing link. This might be the break I've been waiting for.* 

Okabe: *I give Mayuri an approving nod, my voice filled with gratitude.* "Good work, Mayuri. Continue your espionage mission."

Mayuri: *I blink in surprise, a little confused by the term.* "SPN hodge?"

Okabe: *I wave it off, a small smile playing on my lips.* "Whatever, it doesn’t matter. Bye."

Mayuri: *I wave back, my heart filled with joy.* "Okay! Bye bye♪"

Okabe: *I watch as she disappears from sight, my heart lightening a bit at her cheerful demeanor. I take a deep breath, ready to face the next challenge. That's when I notice something odd.*

Okabe: *A woman is squatting nearby, her knees drawn up to her chest. Her eyes are glued to the screen of a gaudy purple phone, her face void of any expression. Recognizing her, I call out.* "Shining Finger!"

Okabe: *I wait for a response, but get none. It's only natural; Shining Finger is just a moniker I created. But what was her name again? Moe... Moekko? No...*

Okabe: *I try again, my voice louder this time.* "Finger!"
