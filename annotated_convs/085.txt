Okabe: *I furrow my brows, my voice echoing in the quiet space.* "Hm? I didn’t quite hear you." 

Moeka: *Her fingers dance over her phone, typing out a message at an almost inhuman speed. A sigh escapes my lips. She really is useless in person.*

Okabe: *I straighten my posture, a confident smirk playing on my lips.* "Don’t worry. I have a network of informants at my disposal. Finding a retro PC should be no trouble at all." 

Moeka: *I catch her gaze for the first time today. There's a spark of respect in her eyes, a silent acknowledgement of my capabilities.*

Okabe: *I throw my head back, a maniacal laughter bubbling up from my chest.* "Have you forgotten who I am? Hououin Kyouma! I will stop at nothing to destroy the System and usher in a new era of chaos! Muhahaha!" 

Moeka: *She speaks up, her voice barely above a whisper.* "That’s... Okabe-kun’s Steins Gate..."

Okabe: *I snap my fingers, pointing at her with a dramatic flourish.* "Not Okabe! Hououin!" 

Okabe: *After parting with Shining Finger, I wander into a nearby PC store, seeking the advice of an employee I happen to know. Despite my hopes, he doesn't have the information I need. As I exit the store, I can't help but ponder over the rapid changes of time and culture that have led to this point, making our search all the more difficult. I shake off the weight of these thoughts, dialing Mayuri's number as I walk down the bustling streets of Akiba.*

Mayuri: *Her voice rings out from the other end, a cheerful tune in the cacophony of the city.* "Tutturu♪ Mayushii here."

Okabe: *I press the phone closer to my ear, my voice steady and calm.* "It’s me. What’s the situation?"

Mayuri: *Her voice is filled with excitement.* "Okarin! I just called you!"

Okabe: *I frown, a hint of worry creeping into my voice.* "Yeah. Did something happen?"

Mayuri: *Her voice is cryptic, a playful lilt to her words.* "Actually, try calling Daru-kun."

Okabe: *My brows furrow in confusion.* "What? Why?"

Mayuri: *She giggles, her voice teasing.* "Daru-kun’s at MayQueen right now. You should call him. He’ll tell you. Bye bye!"

Okabe: *I raise my voice, trying to stop her.* "Wait! Hey, Mayuri! Hey!" 

Okabe: *A sigh escapes my lips as I'm met with the dial tone. She's hung up. I shake my head, dialing Itaru's number.*

Itaru: *His voice is relaxed, the ambient sounds of MayQueen echoing in the background.* "What’s up?"

Okabe: *I lean against a wall, my voice steady.* "It’s me. Report the situation."

Itaru: *He chuckles, his voice filled with amusement.* "Okarin? You’re the only one who talks like that. Did you hear from Mayu-shi?"

Okabe: *I frown, shaking my head despite him not being able to see me.* "No, she didn’t tell me anything."

Itaru: *His voice lowers, a hint of excitement creeping into his words.* "Well, I’m at MayQueen right now. Mayu-shi did some investigating. Sounds like Faris-tan knows about the IBN 5100."

Okabe: *I jolt upright, my heart pounding in my chest.* "What!? Faris!?"
