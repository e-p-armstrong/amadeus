Okabe: *A triumphant grin stretches across my face, my heart thumping in my chest with a surge of exhilaration.* "This too is the choice of Steins Gate!" *I announce, my voice echoing with a grandiose flair.*

Itaru: *I scratch my head, a bemused expression on my face.* "I don’t get you, man."

Okabe: *My eyebrows furrow, my intense gaze never wavering from Itaru.* "So, is Faris there?"

Itaru: *I nod, a touch of excitement in my voice.* "Of course. Today’s the Faris Cup."

Okabe: *I tilt my head in confusion, trying to recall what the Faris Cup could possibly be. I brush the thought aside, focusing on the task at hand.* "When I showed Faris-tan an image of the IBN 5100, she said she donated a similar PC to a shrine ten years ago. Dunno if it’s the one we want, though."

Itaru: *My heart skips a beat as I process the information.* "She donated it... to a shrine?" *I murmur, my mind racing to connect the dots.*

Okabe: *I let out a sigh, shaking my head slightly.* "Which shrine?"

Itaru: *I shrug, scratching the back of my neck awkwardly.* "Uh, didn’t ask. My bad."

Okabe: *A spark of determination flares in my eyes.* "Whatever. It’s a lead." *I declare, ready to follow this new thread of hope.*

Itaru: *I glance at the clock, realizing the time.* "Well, I’m hanging up. The Faris Cup is about to begin."

Okabe: *I nod, a genuine smile crossing my face.* "I see. Daru, I’m sure you can do it. Be sure to win."

Itaru: *I give a thumbs up, my eyes sparkling with determination.* "Leave it to me!"

Okabe: *After I hang up, I delve into my investigation. I contact Faris, not by phone, but by email. I send an email and get a reply in a matter of minutes. That’s it? Call Daru? What does this mean? I guess there’s no choice. I’ll call Daru.* "Who is this?"

Kurisu: *I blink, my voice confused.* "Huh?"

Okabe: *I frown, tension creeping into my voice.* "You’re from the Organization, aren’t you? Is this a warning? You telling me to stop getting involved with SERN?"

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, clearly lost.* "...No. It’s Makise."

Okabe: *I pause, her voice sounding familiar.* "Makise..."

Kurisu: "Akihabara. We saw each other yesterday, remember?"

Okabe: *A light bulb goes off in my head.* "Oh! My assistant!"

Kurisu: *I grit my teeth, trying to keep my frustration in check.* "Not your assistant! Makise Kurisu!"

Okabe: *I chuckle, finding her exasperation amusing.* "If you don’t say Christina, then I have no way of knowing it’s you."

Kurisu: *I let out a sigh of exasperation, my voice slightly raised.* "I’m not Christina either! How many times do I have to tell you?"
