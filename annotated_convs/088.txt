Luka: *I wring my hands together nervously, my gaze fixed on the broom in the corner of the room.* "I’m sorry, but, it gets in the way when I’m cleaning, so..."

Okabe: *I throw my arm out dramatically, my voice deepening with mock seriousness.* "What if they attack while you’re cleaning? Nobody’s going to come to your rescue, you know."

Luka: *I blink in surprise, my mouth forming a small 'o'. I fumble with the hem of my shirt, my heart pounding.* "Th-that’s true... I’ll be more careful from now on."

Kurisu: *I frown, crossing my arms over my chest as I eye Okabe suspiciously.* "Hey. What are you two talking about?"

Luka: *I notice Kurisu's presence and give Okabe a puzzled look, my hands clenched tight in my lap.* "Um... who might this be?"

Okabe: *I gesture towards Kurisu with a dismissive wave of my hand, my lips quirking into a smirk.* "My assistant."

Kurisu: *I flinch at Okabe's words, my cheeks flushing a deep red.* "No! What kind of introduction is that!?"

Okabe: *I shrug, a teasing glint in my eyes.* "I’m only telling the truth, Christina."

Luka: *I tilt my head, my eyes wide with curiosity.* "You’re n-not Japanese?"

Kurisu: *I nod, trying to keep my voice steady despite the irritation bubbling up inside me.* "I am Japanese."

Okabe: *I turn my attention back to Luka, trying to hide my amusement at Kurisu's annoyance.* "Anyway, Lukako. I need to talk to your father about--"

Kurisu: *I cut Okabe off, my patience wearing thin.* "Wait! Introduce me properly!"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow at Kurisu, my smirk widening.* "You want to be introduced? Properly?"

Kurisu: *I huff, crossing my arms over my chest defiantly.* "It’s unnatural not to be introduced in this situation!"

Okabe: *I throw my hands up in exasperation, rolling my eyes at Kurisu's insistence.* "I didn’t come here to introduce you to Lukako!"

Kurisu: *I glare at Okabe, my hands clenching into fists at my sides.* "An introduction wouldn’t take more than ten seconds! What’s wrong with you?"

Luka: *I fidget uncomfortably, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Um... please don’t fight..."

Okabe: *I sigh, giving Luka a reassuring smile before turning back to Kurisu.* "This is Makise Kurisu. My assistant."

Kurisu: *I let out a frustrated sigh, pinching the bridge of my nose.* "Yeah, whatever. Assistant, whatever... sigh."

Luka: *I bow politely, my cheeks tinted pink.* "Nice to meet you, Makise-san. I’m Urushibara L-Luka."

Kurisu: *I return Luka's bow, a small smile tugging at the corners of my lips.* "Nice to meet you too. How old are you?"

Luka: *I fiddle with the hem of my shirt, my gaze fixed on the ground.* "17 this year."

Kurisu: *I nod, a thoughtful look in my eyes.* "A year younger than me..."

Luka: *I glance up at Kurisu, surprise written all over my face.* "Oh, really? Makise-san, you’re so grown up, I can’t believe we’re only a year apart."

Okabe: *I chuckle at Luka's words, giving Kurisu a teasing smirk.* "That means you look old."

Luka: *I gasp, my eyes widening in horror.* "No, that’s not what I... um, I mean you’re very beautiful!"

Kurisu: *I blush at Luka's words, a genuine smile spreading across my face.* "Thanks. I think you’re very cute."

Okabe: *I roll my eyes at the exchange, turning my attention back to Luka.* "You’re introduced. Happy? Can we move on now?"

Kurisu: *I huff, crossing my arms over my chest as I glare at Okabe.* "You are such a jerk."

Okabe: *I ignore Kurisu's comment, my gaze serious as I focus on Luka.* "Anyway, Lukako, I require an audience with your father. Can you make it happen?"

Luka: *I nod, a puzzled frown on my face.* "Yes, sure, but why do you need to talk to my dad?"

Okabe: *I straighten up, my voice dropping to a dramatic whisper.* "It’s a grave matter that concerns the future of mankind."

Luka: *I gasp, my eyes widening with shock.* "The future..."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow at Okabe, my voice laced with disbelief.* "Of mankind?"

Luka: *I quickly stand up, my heart pounding in my chest.* "I’ll go get him!"

Okabe: *I watch as Luka races into the shrine office, a smirk tugging at the corners of my lips.* "He believes just about everything I say. He’s really easy to deal with, unlike my rebellious assistant."

Kurisu: *I sneeze suddenly, my nose twitching as I sniffle.* "Achoo! Oh no, did I catch a cold?"

Okabe: *I chuckle at Kurisu's predicament, my attention shifting to Luka's father as he appears.* "Lukako’s father soon appears. Lukako is pretty flustered. He’s practically dragging his father behind him."

Luka: *I tug on my father's sleeve, my voice filled with urgency.* "Hurry, Dad! Hurry!"

Luka’s Father: *I stumble after Luka, my voice tired and confused.* "Slow down a little. If you rush me, I’m going to fall."

Luka: *I glance back at my father, my eyes filled with panic.* "But the future of mankind is at stake!"
