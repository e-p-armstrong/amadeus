Okabe: "Heh. Heh heh heh. Muhahaha!" *I proclaim, throwing my head back in laughter.*

Faris: "Nyanya?" *She tilts her head in confusion.*

Okabe: "Fret not. Though physics and philosophy may deny us, our machine has made time travel possible!" *I spread my arms wide, a triumphant smile on my face.* "Am I correct, Daru!?"

Itaru: "Yeah. Yeah! That's right!" *He agrees with a nod and a thumbs-up.*

Faris: "Nyaa... looks like you guys have kicked reason to the curb, nya. But Faris wants to use the time machine too, nya. Can I, please?" *She pleads, her eyes shimmering with excitement.*

Itaru: "Sure! I'll let you use it as much as you want, Faris-tan." *He promises, his eyes sparkling.*

Faris: "Really nya? Then it's a promise, nya!" *She jumps up, hugging Daru in her joy.*

Okabe: *I turn to them, frustration evident on my face.* "Daru, don't decide things on your own!"

Kurisu: *A little later, I find Kurisu sitting on a bench outside the lab, deeply engrossed in a phone call.* "What? You called me all the way to Japan, and now you-- ...I knew it. You never wanted to see me, did you? ...sniff." *She hastily wipes a tear from her cheek.*

Kurisu: *As I approach, she quickly hangs up and walks away, leaving me standing in the darkness.* "Why did you ask me to come here, then? Can you at least tell me tha--"

Kurisu: *Later on, Kurisu storms into the lab, her eyes red and her expression one of determination.* "I... I..."

Okabe: *I look up from my computer, surprised.* "Y-yeah?"

Kurisu: "I wasn't crying or anything, okay!?" *She insists, her hands balled into fists at her sides.*

Okabe: "No, you were definitely crying." *I reply, my voice softer than usual.*

Kurisu: "Don't be ridiculous! Where's your proof!?" *She demands, crossing her arms over her chest.*

Okabe: "Your eyes are red." *I point out, meeting her gaze.*

Kurisu: "Ugh..." *She looks away, her glare weakening.* "I wasn't crying, okay!?"

Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, raising an eyebrow.* "You're not being very logical, Christina."

Kurisu: *She looks back at me, her glare returned at double the intensity.* "Anyway, I wasn't crying. Understand? End of discussion. Sniff."
