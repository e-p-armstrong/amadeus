Plan:
Okabe is a serious, eccentric character with a flair for the dramatic. His actions will reflect his grandiose persona and deep thoughtfulness. Kurisu is a fiercely intelligent, slightly tsundere character who hides her warmth under a layer of sharp wit. Luka's father is a cheerful, open character, while Luka himself is shy and delicate. The unspoken lines will be worked into Okabe's dialogue, as his internal monologue. The anchor lines will be Okabe's realization about the computer and Kurisu's interaction with Luka's father, which will be written to evoke a sense of emotional depth.

Roleplay:
Okabe: *I bow slightly, my gloved hand hovering over my heart in a gesture of respect.* "The honor is mine."

Kurisu: *I interject quickly, my eyes flicking between Okabe and Luka's father.* "...His name isn’t Hououin. It’s Okabe."

Luka’s Father: *His brow furrows, a bemused smile playing at his lips.* "Oh. Really?"

Okabe: *I whirl around to face Kurisu, my coat billowing out behind me.* "You there, assistant! Stop making things complicated!"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, a defiant spark in my eyes.* "I’m just telling the truth." 

Okabe: *My eyebrows knit together as I turn my gaze back to Luka's father.* What did she come here for?

Luka’s Father: *His laughter echoes through the room.* "Luka told me his name was Hououin. Hmm, maybe Luka was just playing a trick on me. Hahaha."

Luka: *His voice is barely above a whisper, his eyes darting nervously to the floor.* "Th-that’s not it, Dad. Okabe-san is his real name, and Hououin is, umm..."

Okabe: *I straighten my spine, my voice firm as I assert my identity.* "I am Hououin."

Kurisu: *Her eyes bore into mine, her voice laced with an undeniable truth.* "Okabe Rintaro is the name your parents gave you, right? Are you denying that?"

Okabe: *My voice raises in exasperation.* "Just be quiet, Zombie!"

Kurisu: *She recoils, her eyes flashing with indignation.* "Who’s a zombie!?"

Luka’s Father: *His laughter fills the room once again.* "Hahaha. It’s great that you all get along."

Luka’s Father: *His gaze settles on Kurisu, his voice warm and inviting.* "Are you one of Luka’s friends too? Please get along with Luka from now on too."

Kurisu: *She stumbles over her words, her eyes wide and unsure.* "Um, I’m..."

Luka’s Father: *His smile is soft as he places a comforting hand on Luka's shoulder.* "As you can see, this child of mine is so delicate."

Luka: *He blushes furiously, squirming under his father's touch.* "C-come on, Dad..."

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu's face crumples, her eyes welling up with unshed tears. What’s wrong? Is she upset that Luka’s father assumes she’s a friend? Kurisu notices my stare and quickly turns away.*

Luka’s Father: *He turns his attention back to me, his gaze expectant.* "So, Hououin-kun. Did you need me for something?"

Okabe: *I collect my thoughts, reminding myself of the gravity of the situation. This is no time for idle chatter. This meeting will shape the course of Ragnarok! The future of mankind is, well, whatever. I’m a mad scientist, not some sort of hero. I explain to Lukako’s father how I need the IBN 5100. And then I ask him if that retro PC was donated to Yanabayashi Shrine. Of course, I don’t disclose any classified information, like how we plan to hack SERN or how this is all related to time machine research.*

Luka’s Father: "I don’t know if ’donated’ is the right word to use... But an old computer was entrusted to this shrine about nine years ago."

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat, my mind racing.* "Eh..."

Okabe: *A cold shiver runs down my spine. No way. Really?*

Okabe: *My eyes widen, realization crashing over me like a tidal wave.* "That’s it! That has to be it!"
