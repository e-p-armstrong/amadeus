Kurisu: *I cross my arms, tilting my head slightly.* "What, is there something wrong with that? I spend all my time doing research."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a smirk playing on my lips.* "You’re wasting your youth, Christina."

Kurisu: *I hold his gaze, my tone steady.* "I used to think the same, until I met you, Okabe. Now, I realize... I’m doing just fine."

*I chuckle under my breath, the corners of my mouth twitching upwards.* ...Touche.

Luka: *I fidget with the hem of my yukata, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Umm, no fighting please..."

*Noticing Lukako’s flustered expression, I decide to ease the tension.* 

Okabe: *I flash a reassuring smile at Lukako.* "You’re a lifesaver, Lukako. Thank your father again for me."

*As I glance around, I notice that Luka’s dad has already returned to the shrine office. Lukako nods in response.*

Kurisu: *I smile gently at Luka.* "Your father is a lovely man."

Luka: *My eyes widen, and I stutter out a response.* "Eh..."

*At my assistant’s nonchalant words, Lukako and I freeze.*

Luka: *I blush deeply, stammering out my words.* "M-my father is m-married... a-ad-adultery... is bad!"

Kurisu: *I blink in surprise.* "Huh?"

Okabe: *I chuckle, teasingly wagging a finger at Kurisu.* "I see, assistant. So you like older men."

Kurisu: *I quickly hold up my hands in defense.* "Hey, wait! Don’t misunderstand, you two. That’s not what I meant!"

Luka: *I clasp my hands together, my voice trembling.* "I-I won’t give up my father..."

Kurisu: *I reach out, placing a comforting hand on Luka's shoulder.* "P-please don’t cry... I just meant I was jealous of how well you get along with your father. That’s all."

Luka: *I blink in surprise, then bow deeply in apology.* "Eh, ah, of course... I’m sorry for the weird misunderstanding! That was so rude of me!"

Kurisu: *I give Luka a reassuring pat on the back.* "Don’t cry. We’ve resolved the misunderstanding, so it’s all okay."

Okabe: *I smirk, unable to resist one last jab.* "...but in the depths of your heart lie feelings for Luka’s dad."

Kurisu: *She turns away, her voice icy.* "Die."

*Seeing Christina turn away, I decide to leave it at that. Angering her any further could lead to violence.*

Okabe: *I turn to Lukako, trying to change the topic.* "Lukako, don’t forget your practice swings with Samidare."

Luka: *I bow, my voice shaky but determined.* "Y-yes sir. I’ll do my best... Umm, El Psy Kongalee..."

Okabe: *I raise a finger, correcting her with a smirk.* "It’s Kongroo! Don’t forget it."

Luka: *I bow again, blushing.* "I’m sorry!"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, frowning at Okabe.* "Hey! What kind of lowlife teases a girl?"

*Chuckling to myself, I ignore Christina and lift up the box with the IBN 5100 inside.*

Okabe: "Hng! ...Gah, it’s heavy!" *I grunt, struggling to lift the box. I can barely get it off the ground. I put it down for now. Now I know why Luka’s dad was red in the face when he brought this thing in.*

Luka: *I tilt my head, looking worried.* "Is it that heavy?"

Kurisu: *I scoff, rolling my eyes.* "Pathetic. It’s only as big as a CRT monitor."

Okabe: *I shrug, grinning at her.* "Then why don’t you try carrying it? Then you’ll understand."

*In response, Kurisu sighs, grabs both ends of the cardboard box, and lifts.*

Kurisu: "Wheugh...!" *She strains with all her might, but gives up without lifting it even a centimeter.*

Kurisu: *She blushes slightly, but still maintains her usual frown.* "...It’s r-really heavy."

*My assistant seems to have a strong competitive spirit.*

Kurisu: "This thing’s gotta weigh like 30 kilos. Maybe we should’ve borrowed a push cart. Urushibara-san, is there one in the shrine?"

Luka: *I lower my gaze, apologizing softly.* "Umm, there is one, but actually, it’s broken... I’m sorry."

Kurisu: *I tap my chin, thinking.* "Oh. Is there some other place we could borrow--"

Okabe: *I interrupt her, shaking my head.* "No, we don’t need a push cart."
