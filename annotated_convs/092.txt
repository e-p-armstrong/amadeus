Kurisu: "Oh come on! I'm being serious here. This isn't the time for your childish--" *She scowls, crossing her arms in frustration.*

Okabe: "And we've hacked into SERN. Those heartless bastards will do anything, even experiment on human beings. And behind them is a power greater than all the nations of the Earth. If we make the PhoneWave (name subject to change) public, they might have us erased." *I announce, my voice filled with a mix of fear and excitement.*

Kurisu: "...You watch too many movies." *She shakes her head dismissively.*

Okabe: "The name 'Committee of 300' appeared in actual SERN documents." *I retort, maintaining my intense tone.*

Kurisu: "Yeah, but..." *Her voice falters, her conviction wavering.*

Mayuri: "Mayushii's kinda scared..." *She whimpers, clutching her stuffed toy tighter.*

Itaru: "If they find out about our hacking, they'll seriously have us killed. I didn't make any mistakes that could give us away, of course." *He adds, typing away at his computer with a serious look on his face.*

Okabe: "Also, and this is the biggest problem--" *I pause, lowering my voice and looking each one of them in the eye.* "If we go public, we won't be able to do cool stuff with D-Mails anymore!"

Kurisu: "Why you..." *She clenches her fists, her patience clearly wearing thin.*

Okabe: "Muhahaha! No way I'm giving up such an awesome machine! I am Hououin Kyouma! The insane mad scientist who rules space and time! What I desire is -- that's right -- CHAOS!" *I declare, my hand raised high in the air.*

Kurisu: "This guy's hopeless. Better do something quick." *She mutters under her breath, her eyes darting around the room.*

Itaru: "Eh?" *He looks up from his computer, confusion written all over his face.*

Okabe: "Hm?" *I raise an eyebrow, intrigued by her comment.*

Mayuri: "Hwe?" *She tilts her head, puzzled.*

Kurisu: "Ah..." *She sighs, running a hand through her hair.*

Okabe: "Christina. Are you an @channe--" *I begin to ask, only to be interrupted.*

Kurisu: "Shut up! I'm not, okay!?" *She snaps, shooting me a glare that could freeze lava.*

Okabe: "Th-that reminds me, Daru. Have you made any progress hacking into SERN?" *I quickly change the subject, turning to Itaru.*

Itaru: "Yeah, right now I'm combing SERN's massive database. It would take years to read it all. For now, I've passed everything that looks important to Makise-shi for translation. Basically, I've gone as deep as I can go. SERN belongs to me now." *He states, his fingers dancing across the keyboard.*

Okabe: "Thank goodness you're on my side." *I breathe a sigh of relief, giving him a nod of approval.*

Okabe: "Christina. Report on the status of these translations." *I ask, turning my attention back to Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "Can you stop talking like that? It's pretentious and annoying as hell." *She huffs, rolling her eyes at my theatrics.*

Mayuri: "Hellâ˜†" *She exclaims, striking a cute, idol-like pose.*

Kurisu: "I just hope it doesn't take ten years..." *She mutters, pinching the bridge of her nose in exasperation.*

Okabe: "So you're saying you want to stay with me for ten years? In other words, you want to work at this lab for the rest of your--" *I begin, only to be cut off.*

Kurisu: "It was sarcasm, get it? Sarcasm." *She clarifies, her tone dripping with sarcasm.*

Okabe: "...Oh. Give me your report, Christina. If you don't, I'll call you an '@channeler'--" *I threaten, a smirk on my face.*

Kurisu: "Didn't you hear me the first time!?" *She interrupts, her glare even colder than before.*

Kurisu: "I've been working on the translation when I have time, but so far I haven't seen anything new about time travel. It looks like SERN is still struggling to find a solution." *She explains, her tone professional.*

Okabe: "Daru, any other results?" *I inquire, turning to Itaru.*

Itaru: "Well, it looks like SERN's in the middle of a big project, so the LHC's at full operation. I'm trying to see if I can cut in and maybe use it secretly." *He responds, his fingers still moving rapidly across the keyboard.*

Kurisu: "What? No way." *Her eyes widen in shock.*

Mayuri: "Is that amazing?" *She asks, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.*

Kurisu: "It's not amazing. It's downright outrageous! Super Hacka, what a monster!" *She exclaims, her face a picture of disbelief.*

Okabe: "Hey, Christina. Are you doing that on purpose?" *I question, an amused grin on my face.*

Kurisu: "Ugh... d-doing what?" *She stammers, her cheeks flushing in embarrassment.*
