Okabe: *Not bothering to call back, I stride purposefully into the courtyard, my eyes falling on a beautiful figure -- a boy dressed in miko robes, sweeping with a bamboo broom.* "Ah, Oka... Kyouma-san, hello," *Luka greets me, his voice barely above a whisper.*

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a hint of disappointment in my tone.* "...Lukako, why don’t you have it?"

Luka: *He blinks at me, visibly confused.* "Huh? Um, are you talking about Demon Sword Samidare?"

Okabe: *I cross my arms, my expression stern.* "I thought I told you to carry it at all times!"

Luka: *He looks down, his voice soft and apologetic.* "I’m sorry, but it gets in the way when I’m cleaning..."

Okabe: *I shake my head, my tone filled with faux disappointment.* "What are you going to do if they attack while you’re cleaning? Nobody’s going to come to your rescue, you know."

Luka: *He nods nervously, his voice barely a whisper.* "Th-that’s true... I’ll be more careful from now on."

Okabe: *I clear my throat, shifting the topic.* "By the way, Lukako. I need to talk to your father. Can you go get him?"

Luka: *He looks at me, his eyes wide with curiosity.* "Yes, I can, but, what do you need to talk to him about?"

Okabe: *I lean in closer, my voice dropping to a dramatic whisper, the gravity of my words hanging in the air.* "Serious business, critical for the future of mankind."

Luka: *His eyes widen in shock.* "The future... of mankind!? I-I’ll go get him!"

Okabe: *Watching as Luka rushes into the shrine office, I can't help but chuckle at his gullibility. Soon enough, he returns, practically dragging his father behind him.* "Hurry, dad! Hurry!" *he urges.*

Luka’s Father: *He sighs, a gentle smile on his face.* "Slow down a little. If you rush me, I’m going to fall."

Luka: *His voice is filled with urgency.* "But the future of mankind is at stake!"

Luka’s Father: *He chuckles, clearly amused.* "Oh. Well. That’s certainly serious."

Luka’s Father: *He turns to me, his smile warm and welcoming.* "Ah, Hououin-kun. It’s been a while. Thank you for always taking care of Luka."

Okabe: *I nod, a respectful smile on my face.* "The honor is mine."

Luka’s Father: *He tilts his head, curiosity evident in his eyes.* "Did you need me for something?"

Luka: *He chimes in, his voice shaking with anticipation.* "Th-that’s right...! The future of mankind...!"

Luka’s Father: *He chuckles, patting his son's shoulder reassuringly.* "That sounds serious."

Okabe: *I explain to Lukako’s father about how I need an IBN 5100, being careful not to disclose any classified information. His expression remains calm and composed throughout, brushing off his son’s panic with a gentle smile.*

Luka’s Father: *He nods thoughtfully, his voice calm.* "I don’t know if ’donated’ is the right word to use... But an old computer was entrusted to this shrine about nine years ago."

Okabe: *I can hardly believe my ears.* "Eh..."

Luka’s Father: *He chuckles at my stunned expression.* "That’s it! That has to be it!" *I exclaim, my heart pounding with anticipation.*
