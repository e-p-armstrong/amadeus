Okabe: *I glance at the path leading to the lab, calculating the distance in my head.* "Fortunately, the lab is less than a 15 minute walk from here."

Luka: *I study the cardboard box housing the IBM 5100, my eyes widening.* "It looks pretty heavy..."

Okabe: *I puff out my chest, trying to appear confident.* "Hmph. No matter how heavy it may look, it’s still just a computer. I can manage." 

Okabe: *I reach out, wrapping my fingers around the edges of the box and pull upwards.* "Huff! ...Gah, it’s heavy!" *I let go, my arms trembling from the effort. Now I understand why Lukako’s father was red in the face when he carried this thing.*

Luka: *I rush over, my eyes wide with worry.* "A-are you okay?"

Okabe: *I grimace, clutching my right wrist as pain shoots through it.* "Kuh... why now!? My right hand... is aching!"

Luka: *I gasp, my hands flying to my mouth.* "B-but, that means...! Umm, umm, I-I’ll perform an exorcism!"

Okabe: *I reach out with my good hand, grabbing Luka's before he can leave.* "Wait... d-don’t go... I’m still okay..."

Luka: *I wring my hands, my eyes darting around in panic.* "B-but Kyouma-san, you look like you’re in pain! Wh-what should I do..."

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, managing a weak smile.* "It’s okay... it’ll stop soon... you don’t need to worry... But... I have a request. Will you hear me out?"

Luka: *I nod eagerly, ready to assist.* "Y-yes, if it’s something I can do!"

Okabe: *I hesitate, struggling to find the right words.* "Please help me... carry this box."

Luka: *My eyes widen, filling quickly with tears.* "Eh..."

Okabe: *I look at Luka, trying to reassure him with a determined smile.* "We can manage... together. You’re the only one I can depend on now."

Luka: *I swallow hard, my eyes meeting Okabe's before looking away.* "Kyouma-san... I don’t know if I can do it..."

Okabe: *I nod, trying to project confidence.* "You can do it. I know you can."

Luka: *I take a deep breath, gathering my resolve.* "...Okay. But, um, if we can take breaks along the way, I’d be happy..."

Okabe: *I grab one side of the cardboard box, my grip firm despite the pain.* "Alright, Lukako, grab the other side."

Luka: *I approach the box, my hands shaking as I reach out to touch it.* "Um... is your arm... okay now?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, keeping my gaze focused on the box.* "No. We can’t let our guard down. This might only be temporary. We need to get this to the lab before I have a relapse."

Luka: *I rush over to the box, my hands trembling as I grab the other side.* "I’ll do my best! But I’m not confident..."

Okabe: *I nod, trying to reassure Luka with a smile.* "Don’t worry. I’ll support you."

Okabe: *Together, we lift the box, the weight causing us both to grunt with effort.* "Brace your legs! Let’s keep going. We’ll move sideways, okay? Don’t move forwards or backwards!"

Luka: *I nod, my face turning red with effort.* "Kayyy... Um, sideways, as in left? Right!?"

Okabe: *I bite back a sigh, my patience wearing thin.* "Right... no, my right, so your left... go left!"

Luka: *I struggle to adjust, my hand starting to cramp.* "Okaayyyyy... B-but, my hand, my hand is cramping..."

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, feeling Luka's grip weaken.* "Fight, Lukako! And whatever you do, don’t drop it! We’re screwed if it breaks!"
