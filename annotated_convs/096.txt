Okabe: *I sigh, glancing back at Lukako who is panting heavily from the exertion.* "Haah... haah... we made it..."

Luka: *With a weak smile, I nod, trying to catch my breath.* "Yeah... thanks for the help... you’re... a lifesaver... Phew, really... thanks..."

Okabe: *I clap him on the shoulder, grinning widely.* "Ah, no..."

Luka: *I start fidgeting, glancing down at my feet.* "Since you’re my master, Kyouma-san, I’m happy... to be of use to you."

Okabe: *I chuckle, patting him on the back.* "He doesn’t wipe the sweat off his brow. But despite that, Lukako turns to me with a brave smile as he speaks. So cute... But he’s a guy. It’s so disappointing!" *I look up to the second floor to see the lights turned on.* "Come forth, my servants! By the covenant I command thee, grant me thy power!"

Luka: *I jump, startled by his sudden outburst.* "K-Kyouma-san!?"

Kurisu: *I stick my head out of the second story window, frowning at Okabe.* "You’re so annoying! What is it!?"

Okabe: *I smirk, crossing my arms.* "Huh, I summoned an assistant. What are you doing here?"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, leaning against the window frame.* "Who’re you calling an assistant? You wouldn’t pick up your phone, so I’ve been waiting here an hour for you."

Okabe: *I pat my pockets, realizing my phone was on silent.* "My phone? That reminds me. Before I went to Yanabayashi Shrine, I got a call from an unknown number. So that was her?"

Mayuri: *I pop up behind Kurisu, waving excitedly.* "Hi, Okarin! Huh? Luka-kun’s with you!"

Suzuha: *I step out from the Braun Tube Workshop, crossing my arms.* "Hey, Okabe Rintaro. The boss says to quiet down. You’re disturbing the neighbors."

Okabe: *I raise my hands in a placating gesture.* "Assemble, servants! We have a mission of the utmost secrecy! Come!"

Mayuri: *I skip over to Okabe, peering into the box.* "What’s this?"

Suzuha: *I lean over to get a better look, my eyes widening in surprise.* "Wait... you got one?"

Okabe: *I nod, grinning widely.* "Indeed I did."

Suzuha: *I punch the air in excitement.* "No way! Amazing! Way to go, Okabe Rintaro! Where did you find it?"

Okabe: *I shrug, trying to play it cool.* "Yanabayashi Shrine."

Suzuha: *I frown, trying to make sense of it.* "Yanbayashi Shrine? You mean, like a Shinto shrine?"

Okabe: *I nod, confirming her question.* "Yeah."

Suzuha: *I scratch my head, still confused.* "What was it doing there..."

Mayuri: *I gasp, clapping my hands together in realization.* "Oh! So that’s why Luka-kun’s with you."

Luka: *I blush, nodding nervously.* "Y-yeah..."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, looking between them.* "What’s this? What’re you talking about?"
