Okabe: *I give a quick glance at Kurisu, noticing her hurried movements.* "The time machine -- its name is the PhoneWave (name subject to change), by the way -- is in our lab."

Mayuri: "Umm, so does that mean it has to keep going for 86, 000 seconds? Won't PhoneWave-chan get tired?" *She asks, her eyebrows furrowed in concern.*

Okabe: "It doesn't actually have to run the entire duration." *I reassure her, recalling the results of our previous experiments.* "The mail reaches the past if you send it as soon as the discharge begins. In accordance with the Butterfly Effect, the remaining seconds should be canceled out. The experiment never happened."

Kurisu: *A familiar voice rings out from the phone.* "Hallo."

Okabe: *I clear my throat, ready to put on a performance.* "It's me. What's the situation?" *I almost drop the phone in surprise as the call abruptly ends.* "She hung up on me!"

Itaru: "Of course she did. Mayu-shi and I are the only ones who can deal with your act, you know?" *He comments, shaking his head with a small grin on his face.*

Kurisu: *Her voice comes through the phone again.* "Hallo."

Okabe: "It's Hououin Kyouma. Don't hang up." *I insist, trying to keep the call going.*

Kurisu: "Oh, it's Okabe. I was sure it was a prank call." *She sounds a bit relieved, but also a bit annoyed.*

Okabe: "It shows you my number, doesn't it!?" *I exclaim, taken aback by her response.* 

Kurisu: "You were talking crazy, so I got scared and hung up." *She explains, her voice steady.*

Okabe: "In other words, you fear the insanity of Hououin Kyouma! Well, I suppose you can't be blamed for--" *I cut myself off as the call ends once again.* "She hung up! Again!"

Itaru: "Like I said, we're the only ones who can put up with you..." *He repeats, giving me a knowing look.*

Kurisu: *Her voice comes through the phone once more.* "Hallo."

Okabe: "This is Okabe Rintaro. Sorry, but could you mess with the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s settings a little, please?" *I ask, trying to keep my voice calm and reasonable.*

Kurisu: "Well why didn't you say so? Hmm... you're going to use the PhoneWave? I don't want to anger the guy downstairs, though." *She says, her voice reflecting a mix of annoyance and concern.*

Okabe: "We're about to perform a critical experiment. Understand, assistant? Mister Braun might yell at you, but that small sacrifice will bring mankind's dream, the time machine, to fruition." *I explain, trying to convey the importance of the experiment.*

Kurisu: "You're really irresponsible, you know that? ...Well? What should I set it to?" *She asks, her tone a mix of resignation and curiosity.*

Okabe: "Set it to..." *I instruct her, giving her the necessary details.* 

Kurisu: "Okay, it's ready." *Her voice comes through the phone, sounding focused and ready to proceed.*
