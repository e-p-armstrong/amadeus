Mayuri: *She waves energetically at me* "Yesterday I went to Nakano to buy doujinshi, remember? While I was there, I found a photo album of a super cute cosplayer! So I splurged on itâ™ª Look, Luka-chan! This is a costume of Sedona from Blood Tune. It's so detailed and cute!"

Luka: *He nods enthusiastically* "It is!"

Okabe: *I glance at Kurisu, who is engrossed in her book, then back at the two girls.* "What are you doing?"

Mayuri: "Take a look, Chris-chan! It's amazing!"

Kurisu: *She briefly looks up from her book, then shakes her head.* "I'm okay."

Mayuri: *She flips through the pages of the album, her eyes lighting up at a new set of photos.* "Wow, look at these swimsuits! So much skin! She's got a great figure, like a gravure idol."

Luka: *He looks down, a blush creeping onto his cheeks.* "I... don't have that great a figure..."

Mayuri: *She smiles reassuringly at him.* "Don't worry, Luka-chan. I'm sure you'll make our big friends breathe hard. And um, plenty of people like flat chests. So even if you don't have breasts, you should still have confidence in yourself."

Kurisu: *She suddenly chokes on her coffee.* "Khmmkhmmkhmm!"

Mayuri: "I know! Once ComiMa's over, let's all go on a trip to the beach! Mayushii's been making costumes all summer. I haven't had time to play at all. What do you think, guys? A lab mem beach trip!"

Luka: *He looks at Mayuri, a bit of worry in his eyes.* "Um... all of the lab mems?"

Kurisu: *She looks up from her book, shaking her head.* "I can't go. I have to go back to America soon, and I haven't even started packing yet."

Okabe: *I smirk at her.* "Yes, I can see you're in a rush. I bet you don't even have time to lounge around and read."

Kurisu: *She snaps her book shut and glares at me.* "Fine, I'll be blunt. There's no way I'm swimming with two perverts like you! If it's just the girl members, I'll happily go."

Okabe: *I laugh.* "Hmph. Be honest, Christina. You just don't want me to see the Mongolian Spot on your butt!"

Kurisu: *She stands up, her face red with anger.* "I don't have a Mongolian Spot!"

Okabe: *I smirk.* "Anyway, if it's just the girl members, then doesn't that rule out Lukako?"

Kurisu: *She frowns, clearly confused.* "What's that supposed to mean?"

Okabe: *I lean back on the couch, an amused smile on my face.* "Didn't we tell you earlier? Lukako is a bonafide guy!"

Kurisu: *She looks at me, her eyes wide.* "You're the worst. Where do you get off calling her a guy?"
