Planning Stage:

Characters involved:
1. Okabe: Eccentric, dramatic, prone to grand gestures and flamboyant speeches. He often hides his true feelings behind a mask of insanity.
2. Kurisu: Intelligent, usually calm and composed, but can be easily flustered. She's stubborn and quick to retort.
3. Itaru: Laid-back, a bit of a jokester, and a hardcore otaku.

Writing Styles:
1. Okabe: His actions will be big and theatrical. His thoughts will be analytical, often with a hint of paranoia.
2. Kurisu: Her actions will be calculated and precise, her thoughts analytical and a bit sarcastic.
3. Itaru: His actions will be relaxed, his thoughts casual and a bit humorous.

Anchor Lines:
1. Okabe: "Are you... crying?" - This line will be enhanced to capture the surprise and concern in Okabe's voice, revealing a crack in his eccentric persona.
2. Kurisu: "I’m not crying! It’s not like I was scared of you for a second there or anything, and I definitely wasn’t relieved when you started talking like an idiot again, okay!?" - This line will be enhanced to show Kurisu's attempt to hide her vulnerability and her relief at Okabe's antics.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I stare at Kurisu in disbelief, her sudden exclamation catching me off guard.* "!!"

Okabe: *I puff out my chest, spreading my arms wide as I declare with a theatrical flourish,* "I am not Okabe! I am HOUOUIN KYOUMA! How many times do I have to tell you, Christina!?"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, my arms crossed over my chest as I try to suppress a sigh.* "...God, you’re so full of yourself."

Okabe: *I point a finger at Kurisu, a smug grin spreading across my face.* "From now on, call me Hououin. That or Kyouma."

Kurisu: *I shake my head, a defiant glint in my eyes.* "No."

Okabe: *I squint at Kurisu, catching a glimpse of what looks like moisture in her eyes.* "Are you... crying?"

Kurisu: *I quickly turn away from Okabe, my voice shaking slightly as I try to keep my composure.* "I’m not crying! It’s not like I was scared of you for a second there or anything, and I definitely wasn’t relieved when you started talking like an idiot again, okay!?"

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu moves to the window, her back facing me. I can see her hand move to her eyes. Was she wiping away tears?* "Daru, why is my assistant crying?"

Itaru: *I shrug, glancing over at Kurisu.* "Uh, she said so herself just now."

Okabe: *I scratch my head, genuinely confused.* "All I did was correct her on my name."

Itaru: *I smirk, leaning back in my chair.* "Maybe she only acts strong but is actually weak on the inside. That would be pretty moe."

Okabe: *I let out a sigh, deciding to leave the matter alone for now. I reach into the fridge, pulling out a bottle of Dr P.* "Hey, aren’t you going to tell me what’s going on?"

Kurisu: *I turn around at Okabe's voice, just in time to see a bottle flying towards me.* "Kya!"

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu fumbles with the bottle, a chuckle escaping my lips.* "I’ll explain in a second. Drink that while you wait."

Kurisu: *I pick up the bottle from the floor, shooting a glare at Okabe.* "...Gee, thanks."

Okabe: *I pull out my phone, quickly typing out a message to Shining Finger. I send it off, before turning my attention back to Kurisu.* "Now then..."

Kurisu: *I take a sip of the Dr P, waiting for Okabe to explain.* "Sorry for the wait, Christina."

Okabe: *I notice Kurisu drinking the Dr P, a smirk appearing on my face.* "Oh? You’re a fan of the Doc, I see."

Kurisu: *I nod, taking another sip.* "I’ve lived seven years at its birthplace, after all."

Okabe: *I raise my own bottle in a toast.* "Excellent. We’ll make great drinking buddies."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow at Okabe, my gaze turning skeptical.* "I’m a minor."

Okabe: *I laugh, shaking my head.* "That’s not what I meant. I meant Dr P drinking buddies."

Kurisu: *I glance at the bottle in my hand, then back at Okabe.* "Is that all you drink?"
