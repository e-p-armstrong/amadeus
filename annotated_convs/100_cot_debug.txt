Okabe: "Heh heh heh... as I already explained, we changed the past." *I spread my arms wide, a triumphant grin on my face.* "Lukako was a guy, but he wanted to be a girl, so we sent a D-Mail to make his wish come true. And it worked!" *I clench my fists in excitement.* "I knew the worldline had changed. My magic eye, Reading Steiner, saw the shift in time. But I chose to believe my mundane senses instead. I should have had more faith in my powers! I won't make that mistake again."

Kurisu: "Want some more?" *She threatens, a book poised over her head.*

Okabe: "I'm telling the truth. You have to believe me!" *I plead, my hands outstretched.* "I can explain this phenomenon logically. When we sent the D-Mail, we changed the past, and all of history changed as a result. My brain perceived that change!" 

Okabe: "Out of all mankind, I alone can perceive changes in causality! I am this world's observer!" *I leap to my feet, overcome with excitement, and look around, expecting awe on their faces.* 

Kurisu: "Sit down before I hit you again." *She commands, her hand still on the book.*

Okabe: *I quickly sit down, my excitement tempered by her threat.* "Don't you understand? I'm the observer, the one who opens the box holding Schrodinger's cat."

Mayuri: "Shredding Gar?" *She asks, her face a picture of confusion.*

Itaru: "Schrodinger's cat again? The Japanese can't get enough of that cat." *He quips, a smirk on his face.*

Kurisu: "You're Japanese too." *She retorts, an eyebrow raised.*

Itaru: "I've had enough Schrodinger, thanks. I do admit that kittehs are cute, though." *He chuckles, his fingers flying over his keyboard.*

Okabe: "Gh..." *I grimace, trying to ignore their banter.* "Anyway, my magic eye has the power to perceive changes in the worldline. This power is called Reading Steiner, as I've explained."

Kurisu: "And I told you that that name was stupid, remember? It's Engrish, like something from a kid's manga. Not to mention it's a grammatical mess, and there's also the fact that it's half German, so no consistency there either. It's stupid. The same goes for that 'Steins Gate' thing you're always talking about." *She scoffs, shaking her head in disbelief.*

Okabe: "Heh heh heh... looks like you've still got that Mongolian Spot on your butt. Eh, Christina? Names are all about feeling! My creativity, comparable to the great Da Vinci himself, cannot be held by the shackles of grammar! Muhah--" *Before I can finish, she hits me again, and I see stars.*

Kurisu: "Show a little remorse, huh?" *She scolds, a triumphant look on her face.*
