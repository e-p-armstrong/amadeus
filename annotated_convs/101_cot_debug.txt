Brainstorming:
The characters involved in this scene are Kurisu, Itaru, and Okabe. 

- Kurisu: She is a highly intelligent and dedicated scientist. She is serious, focused, and driven, often exhibiting a certain stubbornness. She is skeptical of Okabe's theories, but is also intrigued and wants to uncover the truth. In this scene, her actions and dialogue should reflect her curiosity and determination, as well as her occasional bemusement at Okabe's eccentricity.
- Itaru: He is a laid-back and somewhat apathetic individual. Despite his often casual demeanor, he is a skilled hacker and an essential member of the team. His dialogue should reflect his relaxed and somewhat disinterested approach, but his actions should show his underlying competence.
- Okabe: He is the eccentric, self-proclaimed mad scientist. He is overly dramatic and often acts out, but he is also deeply passionate about his work. He tends to monologue and over-explain things. His actions should reflect his larger-than-life personality and his dedication to his work.

Plan for anchor lines: 
- Kurisu: "...I’ll wait until then." - This line sets the tone for Kurisu's determination and her commitment to uncovering the truth. I will emphasize her resolve and her refusal to be swayed.
- Okabe: "If you’re gonna do science, you need a lab coat! Right!?" - This line encapsulates Okabe's eccentricity and his enthusiasm for the scientific process. I will highlight his excitement and his belief in the importance of the lab coat.

Roleplay:
Kurisu: *My brows furrow in a mix of determination and uncertainty.* "...I’ll wait until then."

Itaru: *I glance at the clock, noticing how late it's getting.* "You’ll wait? It’s already getting dark. Why not go home for tonight and come back tomorrow morning?"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, a hint of stubbornness in my eyes.* "No thanks. I’ll wait. I want to know as soon as possible, even if it’s just a microsecond sooner."

Okabe: *I chuckle, a wry grin spreading across my face.* "Heh heh heh, that’s the spirit. You’re already fascinated by the conspiracy. You can’t help but want to know what lies at the heart of SERN."

Kurisu: *I look at Okabe, my gaze intense.* "If what you guys are saying is true... then this isn’t something to joke about. SERN is the world’s top research institution. If they’re doing secret experiments without publishing their results... They’re making fools of scientists the world over. That’s only if it’s true, though." *I emphasize the last part, making it clear that I'm still not entirely convinced.*

Okabe: *Looking at Kurisu, I can see the skepticism in her eyes, but also a hint of curiosity. I nod, understanding her stance.* "Anyway, Daru. I’ll leave it to you." *I turn to Itaru, giving him a knowing look. The IBN 5100 is heavy, but we manage to drag it into the development room, Kurisu following us.*

Kurisu: *Looking around the room, I spot the PhoneWave.* "Can you show me the PhoneWave?"

Okabe: *I perk up at her interest.* "Indeed I can. Want to experiment?"

Kurisu: "You haven’t been able to send another email to the past yet, right? Do you know why?" *I ask, my curiosity piqued.*

Okabe: *I shake my head, unable to provide an answer.* 

Kurisu: *I look around the development room, taking in the various gadgets and equipment.* "Let’s run some tests."

Kurisu: *As I survey the room, I can't help but comment.* "Man. You have a ton of junk."

Okabe: *I feel a pang of indignation at her words.* "It’s not junk! Since you’re new to the Future Gadget Laboratory, I’ll explain. These are the glorious fruits of our science: the Future Gadgets! Future Gadgets 1-7 are stored here. The PhoneWave, with which you are already familiar, is Gadget Number 8."

Kurisu: *I pick up one of the gadgets, examining it closely.* "Future Gadgets, huh..."

Kurisu: *As I pick up one of the gadgets, I can't help but raise an eyebrow.* "Hey. Isn’t this... a weapon?"

Okabe: *I quickly explain, eager to share the purpose of the gadget.* "Future Gadget No. 4: Moad Snake, designed after a claymore landmine, is an instant humidifier."

Kurisu: *I give a small laugh, shaking my head at the eccentricity of it all.* "How confusing."

Okabe: "Insert water and turn the power on, and in mere seconds, it generates a thick cloud of steam."

Kurisu: *I place the gadget back on the shelf, chuckling to myself.* "So it’s junk. I thought so."

Kurisu: *I notice a lab coat hanging on the shelf. Without waiting for a reply, I grab it and put it on.* "I’m borrowing this."

Okabe: *My eyes widen in surprise, and I can't help but exclaim.* "Whoa!"

Kurisu: *I adjust the lab coat, a satisfied smile on my face.* "It’s just not right without a lab coat."

Okabe: *Overwhelmed with emotion, I seize Kurisu’s hand and grasp it firmly.* "Assistant! You get it, don’t you!?"

Kurisu: *I pull my hand away, flustered.* "G-get what? Let go!"

Okabe: *My grip tightens, my eyes shining with fervor.* "If you’re gonna do science, you need a lab coat! Right!?"
