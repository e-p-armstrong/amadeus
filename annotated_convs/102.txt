Kurisu: *I cross my arms, trying to keep my composure despite the annoyance pricking at my nerves.* "I don’t know if that’s supposed to be a compliment, but it’s coming off as an insult. Now let go!" *With a swift move, I shake off his hand, turning my back to him, creating a physical barrier between us.*

Okabe: *I watch her turn away, a hint of amusement dancing in my eyes.* "I’m giving you that lab coat to commemorate your joining the lab. Don’t worry. It’s never been worn. Or maybe this fateful encounter between you and that lab coat was decided by destiny long ago. Daru not wearing it was just another inevitability. This is the choice of Steins--"

Kurisu: *I spin around, my patience wearing thin.* "Shut up so we can start the experiment."

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu thrusts both hands into her lab coat’s pockets, then bends down to inspect the time machine now placed underneath the table. The scars from the previous experiment are evident - the broken table, the hole in the floor. I can't help but feel a twinge of worry at the potential danger of a similar outcome.* 

Kurisu: *I glance back at him, a question hanging in the air.* "...So you haven’t tampered with the microwave at all?"

Okabe: *I point to the X68000, the glow of the screen casting an eerie light in the room.* "It’s in terminal mode now. We can change the factory settings like this, make the microwave do things its manufacturer never intended."

Kurisu: "How was it set when the discharge phenomenon occurred?"

Okabe: *I shrug, my gaze fixed on the screen.* "Nothing out of the ordinary. It was at factory settings."

Kurisu: *I hum in thought, eyeing the bunch of bananas on the table.* "Hmm. I’ll take a banana."

Okabe: *I glance at the bananas, only three left in the bunch.* "Those are Mayuri’s."

Kurisu: *I pluck a banana from the bunch, a smirk playing on my lips.* "Oh, so I don’t need your permission, then. I’ll go buy new bananas tomorrow."

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu places the banana inside the PhoneWave, typing on her phone with a determined focus. The machine whirs to life, turning backwards for 120 seconds. When the chime rings, we both hold our breaths.*

Kurisu: *I sigh, disappointment creeping into my voice.* "...Nothing happened."

Okabe: *I glance at the microwave, the banana sitting there, stubbornly un-gelified.*

Kurisu: "Ow!" *I yelp, pulling my hand back from the microwave quickly, blowing on my fingers to soothe the burn.*

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a hint of satisfaction in my voice.* "Meaning the microwave functioned normally."

Kurisu: *Undeterred, I throw in a new banana, setting the machine to reverse rotation for another 120 seconds. When the second banana warms up too, I can't help but feel a pang of frustration.*

Okabe: *I lean back, my mind racing as I try to piece together the puzzle.* "What does this mean..."

Kurisu: *I shrug, a resigned sigh escaping my lips.* "I guess what happened earlier was an irregularity after all."

Okabe: *I shake my head, my voice firm with determination.* "I don’t know if it’s an irregularity or not, but we ought to investigate the cause."

Kurisu: *I nod, agreeing for once, though for different reasons.* "I agree."

Okabe: *I let out a breath, a sudden clarity washing over me.* "In the previous experiment... After spending 120 seconds in the PhoneWave, the banana teleported back to the bunch gelified. We should consider that it returned to its state 120 seconds before."
