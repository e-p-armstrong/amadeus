Okabe: *I watch her as she works, my eyes scanning over her focused expression. The lab is quiet, save for the hum of the machines and the rustling of papers.* "Christina, is it okay to stay here this late? Perhaps you should contact your family."

Kurisu: *She doesn't look up from her work, her voice steady and dismissive.* "No need."

Okabe: *Surprised, I lean back in my chair, studying her. There's a hint of defiance in her tone that piques my curiosity.* "What? Do your parents let you do whatever you want?"

Kurisu: *She finally turns to me, her eyes meeting mine with an unreadable expression. A long sigh escapes her lips before she speaks, her voice quieter than before.* "I haven’t seen my father in seven years. My mother is in America. I’m living in a hotel right now. Understand?"

Okabe: *Stunned, I stare at her, my mind racing to process her words. My initial shock quickly gives way to a surge of indignation.* "Wha...! You damn celebrity! If you’re American, then you should at least use a motel instead of a hotel, right!?"

Kurisu: *I see a flicker of annoyance cross her face as she rolls her eyes at me.* "I’m not American, and there aren’t any motels in the heart of Tokyo."

Okabe: *I ignore her irritation, my curiosity piqued.* "What sort of hotel?"

Kurisu: *She shrugs, turning her attention back to her work.* "What do you mean? It’s a normal hotel in Ochanomizu."

Okabe: *I lean forward, resting my elbows on the table.* "Ochanomizu? Then you can walk there from here, can’t you?"

Kurisu: *She nods, not bothering to look up from her work.* "Sure."

Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, the pieces finally falling into place.* "So, tell me about your father."

Kurisu: *She freezes, her eyes widening slightly as she looks up at me.* "Sorry?"

Okabe: *I press on, undeterred by her surprise.* "You said you haven’t seen him in seven years?"

Kurisu: *Her expression hardens, her gaze turning icy.* "Why do you care about my father?"

Okabe: *I meet her gaze, my tone firm.* "You’re the one who mentioned him. Isn’t that basically a hidden message saying ’please give me some advice about my father, please’?"

Kurisu: *She scoffs, turning away from me.* "You’re crazy."

Okabe: *I rise to my feet, my voice resolute as I declare,* "You are my assistant! And I can’t let my assistant have any worries. So tell me everything that’s on your mind!"

Kurisu: *She remains silent, her gaze fixed on the circuit box on the wall. Her silence speaks volumes, and I realize I may have crossed a line.*

Okabe: *Concerned, I soften my tone.* "What’s wrong?"

Kurisu: *She shakes her head, her voice barely above a whisper.* "I have nothing to say to you."
