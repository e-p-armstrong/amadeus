Planning/Brainstorming:

Okabe: Okabe is an eccentric character, often dramatic and theatrical. His actions should be exaggerated and filled with confidence, even when he's wrong. He's also the main character, so his thoughts are crucial to understanding the scene.

Kurisu: Kurisu is an intelligent, somewhat introverted character. She's frustrated in this scene, so her actions should be curt and her words sharp. Her actions should reflect her trying to distance herself from Okabe's insensitivity.

Itaru: Itaru is a laid-back, playful character. His actions should reflect his casual, nonchalant attitude, even in the face of their hacking endeavors. 

For the anchor lines, I will choose Okabe's line: "Look carefully. And burn it into your eyes. The proof of SERN’s actions, its deceit upon the world." and Kurisu's line: "Of people’s family issues like that. You’re trampling on my heart." I will infuse Okabe's line with a sense of gravity and revelation, while Kurisu's line will be imbued with deep hurt and bitterness.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I can't help but wince as I hear what I think is the grinding of Kurisu’s teeth.* "...Y-you’re really mad at me, aren’t you?"

Kurisu: *Her voice, low and dangerous, sends shivers down my spine.* "Don’t make fun..."

Okabe: *I swallow hard, taking in her refusal to meet my gaze.* "Of people’s family issues like that. You’re trampling on my heart."

Okabe: *My mind races, realizing I might have stepped on a landmine with her father situation. I open my mouth to apologize, but before I can say anything--*

Itaru: *The lab reverberates with Daru’s triumphant war cry.* "Hell yeahhhhhhh!"

Okabe: *My eyes light up, the tension momentarily forgotten.* "Did you get it!?"

Itaru: *He flashes a wide grin, his white teeth a stark contrast to the dim lab, and gives a thumbs up.* "Mission complete."

Itaru: *His voice is filled with giddy excitement.* "I got the server admin’s ID and password. Now we can peep as much as we want, hyahoohh!"

Okabe: "And the IBN 5100 database?"

Itaru: *He chuckles, his eyes dancing with mirth.* "That’s separate, duh. The server admin’s unrelated. I mean, it’s a database with normally unreadable code, so there’s a limit on who can access it. Doesn’t look like even the lab director can access it."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a seed of doubt sprouting in my mind.* "There are positions higher than that?"

Itaru: *He shrugs nonchalantly.* "There’s something called the SERN Executive Council."

Okabe: *I let out a thoughtful hum.* "Hmm... So they call it a council, eh?"

Itaru: *He looks at me curiously.* "What about it?"

Okabe: *I let out a dramatic sigh, my eyes glinting with a newfound determination.* "It’s a fitting name for our enemy!"

Okabe: *I glance at Kurisu, catching the cold look she gives me. I shrug it off, deciding to leave the IBN 5100 database for another day.* "Run a search for data on time travel research."

Itaru: *He nods, his fingers flying over the keyboard.* "Okey-dokey. That Z Program we saw last time was suspicious, wasn’t it?"

Okabe: "That, and the Jellyman’s Report."

Okabe: *I turn to Kurisu, her angry expression replaced with a focused stare at the monitor.* "Look carefully. And burn it into your eyes. The proof of SERN’s actions, its deceit upon the world."

Itaru: *He lets out a triumphant laugh.* "Oh yeah, baby. Found the LHC project supervisor."

Okabe: *I lean in closer, my heart pounding with anticipation.* "The supervisor... that’s a pretty important post."

Itaru: *He chuckles, the thrill of their illicit activities evident in his voice.* "Right now, we’re peeking inside his computer. Z Program, Z Program... hmm..."

Okabe: *I slam my fist onto the table, my voice filled with conviction.* "Z obviously stands for jelly (zerii)!"

Kurisu: *She rolls her eyes, her voice dripping with sarcasm.* "Jelly starts with J. J-E-L-L-Y."

Itaru: *He bursts into laughter, shaking his head at my mistake.* "Pfft, careless mistake. So uncool."

Okabe: *I clear my throat, trying to regain my composure.* "Ahem! What I meant to say is that there’s no way it would have such a simple name. The name’s hiding something important. There has to be a double meaning!"

Okabe: *I watch as Daru, who’s been searching through the log, suddenly stops.*

Itaru: *He grins widely, the excitement in his voice palpable.* "Got it!"

Itaru: *He displays a graphic on the monitor, a scan of a very old paper document. The letterhead reads Z PROGRAM: TOP SECRET.* "The program began... in 1973."

Okabe: *I turn to Daru, my voice filled with curiosity.* "When was SERN formed?"

Kurisu: *Her answer is immediate, her tone flat.* "1954."

Okabe: *I frown, my earlier guess proven wrong.* "When was the IBN 5100 put on market?"
