Kurisu: *I cross my arms, a smirk playing on my lips.* "What Organization, you chuunibyou nutjob? At least try to be serious some of the time."

Okabe: *I scoff, waving away her comment with a dramatic flourish of my hand.* "Hmph, don’t be ridiculous. My words are always grounded in truth."

Itaru: *I glance at the document in front of me, scratching my head.* "Anyway, shouldn’t it be ’the Committee’ instead of ’the Organization’? That’s what it says here."

Kurisu: *My brows furrow in confusion.* "The Committee of 300? I don’t think they mean SERN’s Executive Council. What are they talking about?"

Okabe: *I pace around the room, my hands clasped behind my back.* "The world is full of lies. It’s not as beautiful as you think."

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, my gaze fixed on Okabe.* "Listen, Okarin..."

Okabe: *I stop pacing, turning to face Itaru.* "I am listening. The Committee of 300 is the dark power that controls every secret society, every government, every multinational corporation."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, clearly unconvinced.* "You’re making things up again."

Okabe: *I point an accusing finger at her.* "It’s the truth. Google it if you don’t believe me. Until now, the human race, for all its accomplishments, has never been able to overcome the barrier called time. The technology of time travel, which can break through that barrier, will change the course of human history. Literally. As it was when we split the atom, this forbidden fruit has the potential to grant us godlike power. Not a man exists who can resist its temptation. And naturally, all those with power will use any means at their disposal to obtain it. Human morality is naught but a joke to those who would stand with the gods. Understand, Christina?"

Kurisu: *I lean back, my arms crossed over my chest.* "...Wow. That was quite a speech. Since you seem to know so much about it, does that mean you’re aiming for godhood too?"

Okabe: *I raise my head high, a wild grin spreading across my face.* "What Hououin Kyouma desires is the destruction of all who would call themselves gods, the collapse of their hateful System, and a glorious new age of Chaos. Muhahaha!"

Kurisu: *I narrow my eyes at him, a slight frown on my face.* "I’m not asking Hououin. I’m asking Okabe."

Okabe: *I clench my fists, my voice rising in defiance.* "I... I am Hououin!" *My pride feels like it's been trampled. That damn assistant, always hitting where it hurts most.*

Kurisu: *I let out a sigh, shaking my head.* "In other words, you don’t have your own reason."

Itaru: *I wave a hand dismissively, trying to defuse the tension.* "Forget about him, Makise-shi. Please keep reading."

Okabe: *I turn to Itaru, my eyes wide in disbelief.* "Daru! What do you mean forget about me?" *My mind is racing. They're not delusions, and they're not theories... But Daru does have a point. Our top priority now is to expose the dark side of the international research organization known as SERN.*

Itaru: *I shrug, my attention already back on the document.* "I’m tired of listening to conspiracy theories. I’m more interested in the Z Program than in your delusions."

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, forcing a calm tone.* "Continue, assistant."

Kurisu: *I sigh, pinching the bridge of my nose.* "At least show respect when you’re asking a favor..." *But despite my complaints, I obediently go back to translating.*

Kurisu: *I clear my throat, my eyes scanning the document.* "Umm... ’Stage 1: Construction and implementation of the Large Hadron Collider.’ ’Over the past half century, beginning with the Proton Synchrotron completed in 1959, particle accelerator technology has reached the point where standardized results may be obtained.’ ’Stage 2: Implementation and testing of lifter technology.’ ’The formation of more than two artificial localized singularities, as well as the formation of Kerr black holes, will become possible when this stage is complete.’ ’In order to hide the program’s true goal, it is necessary to intentionally leak misinformation regarding the formation of black holes.’ ’Stage 3: Animal experimentation.’ ’Stage 4..."
