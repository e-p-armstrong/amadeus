Okabe: "Hmm... I thought it was a good idea..." *I lean back in my chair, crossing my arms in thought.*

Kurisu: "Of course... If it works, then maybe..." *She interrupts, her eyes wide with sudden realization.* "Maybe we can do it!" 

Okabe: "Are you serious?" *I sit up straight, taken aback by her sudden enthusiasm.*

Kurisu: "The data compression part, at least, is easy. We can just use the black holes created by the LHC, since black holes compress everything they swallow. Compression won't harm data like it would harm a human. As long as we're just sending data, there's nothing to worry about." *She explains, her hands moving animatedly as she talks.*

Okabe: "How do you plan to convert humans into data?" *I raise an eyebrow, intrigued by her idea but skeptical of its feasibility.*

Kurisu: "You know that my thesis got published, right?"

Okabe: "This is no time to flaunt your accomplishments." *I retort, trying to keep the focus on our discussion.*

Kurisu: "Have you read it?" *She asks, ignoring my jibe.*

Itaru: "I've got scans if you want to read it." *He offers, pulling up the document on his computer.*

Kurisu: "The title of my thesis is... 'Analysis of Memory-Related Nerve Impulses in the Temporal Lobe'" *She announces, her voice filled with pride.*

Okabe: "...Temporal lobe? Nerve impulses?" *I scratch my head, trying to make sense of the jargon.* "No, wait. This can't be right. This title sounds like, um, neuroscience, not physics."

Kurisu: "I'm a neuroscientist. Got a problem?" *She challenges, crossing her arms and raising an eyebrow.*

Okabe: "No, forget about that. How is this related to time travel?" *I ask, waving off her question and getting back to the point.*

Kurisu: "Converting an entire human to data is impossible. But converting a human's memories may be possible!" *She declares, her eyes lighting up with excitement as she delves into the details of her theory.* "Imagine a chest of drawers. Each drawer is filled with tiny boxes, and inside each box is another bunch of tiny boxes. You keep opening boxes until you find the memory you're looking for." *She finishes her explanation, watching us closely for our reactions.*

Okabe: *I sit in stunned silence for a moment, processing her words.* "So, if we combine VR technology with my research... do you see where I'm going?" *I ask, finally understanding the significance of her research.*
