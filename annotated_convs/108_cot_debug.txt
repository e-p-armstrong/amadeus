Planning:
The characters involved are:

1. Okabe: A self-proclaimed mad scientist, he is eccentric, verbose, and often theatrical. He has a strong sense of responsibility, and cares deeply for his friends, even if he doesn't always show it. His actions will be somewhat dramatic, but underlined by a serious undertone in this tense scene.

2. Kurisu: A brilliant neuroscientist, she is mature, logical and somewhat tsundere. She can be stubborn and determined, especially when it comes to scientific truth. Her actions will be grounded and serious, with a touch of defiance.

3. Itaru: A talented hacker and Okabe's right-hand man, he is laid-back, nonchalant, but also very loyal. He will act with a casual ease, despite the gravity of the situation.

Anchor lines:
1. Okabe: "Daru... look up the Jellyman’s Report."
2. Okabe: "Alright... let’s begin."

These lines mark pivotal moments in the scene, and will be enhanced to convey Okabe's determination and resolve despite his fears.

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I swallow hard, my voice barely more than a whisper as the weight of the revelation presses down on me.* "...Human experimentation."

Itaru: *I blink, the words striking me like a punch. My fingers twitch involuntarily, momentarily freezing over the keyboard.* "...For real?"

Okabe: *A cold shiver runs down my spine, my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. I feel the joy of our little scientific adventure fading, replaced by a creeping dread. Was this the path we were walking?* "I... I remember, Daru. That email... 'Human is dead, mismatch.' Jellyman’s Report... Could it mean...?"

Itaru: *I choke on my own words, my eyes darting between Okabe and Kurisu, looking for some reassurance. But I find none.* "Could that have something to do with... human experimentation?"

Okabe: *My throat tightens, the words sticking like tar. I glance at Kurisu and Daru, their faces pale and anxious. I feel the weight of responsibility settling on my shoulders.* "Daru... look up the Jellyman’s Report."

Itaru: *I blink in surprise, my hand hovering over the mouse.* "Really?"

Okabe: *I nod, my gaze steely.* "Really. But first, Christina."

Kurisu: *I blink, caught off-guard.* "Eh?"

Okabe: *I turn to face her, my expression grave.* "You should leave."

Kurisu: *I frown, confusion clouding my features.* "Why are you suddenly--"

Okabe: *I cut her off, my voice urgent.* "The Jellyman’s Report... it just gives me a bad feeling. You’re a genius. You’re already published, for crying out loud. There’s no need to throw away your promising future."

Kurisu: *I blink at Okabe, a hint of surprise flickering in my eyes.* "Are you worried about me?"

Okabe: *I sigh, my shoulders slumping slightly.* "Of course I am. You are my assistant, after all."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, my gaze challenging.* "...I keep telling you, I’m not your assistant. Thanks for your concern. But I’m not leaving. We need to expose this truth to the world."

Okabe: *I shake my head, my heart pounding with fear for her safety.* "No! It’s too dangerous."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, a spark of defiance in my eyes.* "You chickening out?"

Okabe: *I grip the edge of the table, my knuckles turning white.* "We’re powerless against this conspiracy. One wrong move, and they’ll have us erased."

Kurisu: *I open my mouth to argue, my resolve unwavering.* "But still--"

Okabe: *I slam my hand on the table, cutting her off.* "This isn’t a game! I’m not joking here."

Kurisu: *I take a deep breath, my gaze softening.* "...Fine. I won’t tell anyone."

Okabe: *I let out a sigh of relief, feeling a small victory despite the tension in the room.* "You won’t regret this?"

Kurisu: *I meet his gaze, my eyes steady and resolute.* "I won’t."

Okabe: *I turn to Daru, my gaze questioning.* "What about you, Daru? Prepared?"

Itaru: *I shrug, my fingers already dancing over the keyboard.* "Well, I am a super hacker."

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, steeling myself for what's to come. My gaze flicks between Daru and Kurisu one last time.* "Alright... let’s begin."
