Okabe: *I raise my hand dramatically, pointing towards the ceiling as a mad scientist would.* "Henceforth, this shall be known as Operation Laegjarn’s Chest!"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, furrowing my brows in confusion.* "Why Norse mythology?"

Itaru: *I shrug, playing with a loose thread on my shirt.* "Is that Norse mythology? Because it’s cool, I guess."

Kurisu: *I sigh, shaking my head.* "Anyway, what is it with men and military terms..."

Okabe: *I clasp my hands together, my eyes burning with determination.* "Daru, begin the operation!"

Itaru: *My fingers dance across the keyboard as I locate the Jellyman’s Report. It requires a second password authentication, which I crack easily.* "Ready? I’m opening it."

Okabe: *I feel the air in the lab thicken, the oppressive heat surrounds us, unable to escape through the closed window. I moisten my parched lips, nodding towards Daru.*

Itaru: *I wipe the sweat off my forehead with a handkerchief, my hand trembling as I press the enter key. The file opens, and at first glance, it looks like a resume. A photograph, personal information, and a long string of English text. Beneath that, a scanned newspaper clipping with a black and white photo. A chill runs down my spine as I realize what the Jellyman in Jellyman’s Report means.*

Kurisu: *I lean over Daru’s shoulder, my voice barely above a whisper as I read the contents out loud.* "’Jellyman’s Report 10’ ’Subject: James McCarthy, Age: 31, American’ ’Z Program Stage 4, Date of Experiment: 2005-01-28 T13:05’"

Kurisu: *I swallow hard, my heart pounding as I continue to read.* "’Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.’"

Itaru: *I mutter under my breath, my eyes wide with disbelief.* "That again..."

Kurisu: *My voice trembles as I read the next part, my hand gripping Daru's shoulder tightly.* "’It is believed that due to infinite compression by supergravity, the subject could not endure passage through the singularity inside the Kerr black hole.’ ’April 3, 1921. New York City. An unidentified man was discovered dead in an alley off Union Square. The right half of his body was embedded in a nearby wall.’"

Okabe: *I can't tear my eyes away from the gruesome image on the monitor. The ticking of the clock is like a hammer inside my head, each tick a reminder of the danger we've stumbled into. It’s past 2 AM. The window is closed, and the lab is silent but for the humming of the computer. I was right. We’re in too deep. I half expect guys in black suits and sunglasses to kick down the door and drag us off to a secret military prison. I quickly check to make sure the door’s locked.*

Itaru: *My voice is barely a whisper, the words barely making it past my lips.* "What’s going on here? They... gelified someone?"
