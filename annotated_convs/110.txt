Kurisu: *I keep my voice steady, maintaining a calm facade despite the grimace tugging at the corner of my lips.* "And this means they’ve created a time machine, doesn’t it? Even if it’s not perfect."

Okabe: *The words catch in my throat, echoing hollowly in my mind.* "Eh...?"

Kurisu: *I glance at Okabe, then back at the article.* "This New York Times article is from 1921."

Okabe: *A chill runs down my spine, the reality of the situation sinking in.* "90 years ago..."

Kurisu: *I point to a section of the black and white photograph, my fingers trembling ever so slightly.* "Look."

Okabe: *I follow her gaze, a cold shiver running down my spine as I recognize the logo.* "SERN..."

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, my brows furrowing in concern.* "So... SERN used the LHC to send someone back to 1921?"

Kurisu: *I nod grimly, my eyes never leaving the horrifying image.* "Looks like they failed to keep him alive, though."

Okabe: *I clench my fists, swallowing the lump in my throat.* "Is this the only report?"

Itaru: *I shake my head, clicking through the files on the screen.* "No, there’s more. Looks like... 14 people in total."

Okabe: *I force the words out, my voice barely above a whisper as the implications hit me.* "More Jellymen? That means more gelified people... more victims of human experimentation..." *I reach for a cold Dr P in the fridge, trying to quench the parched feeling in my throat.* "Show me the others."

Kurisu: *As Itaru pulls up another report, I start translating out loud, my voice void of any emotion.* "’Jellyman’s Report 9.’ ’Subject: Dan Strayski, Age: 26, Canadian.’ ’Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2004-9-6 T 14:10.’ ’Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.’ The newspaper clipping... I think it’s in French. I can’t read it."

Okabe: *I lean forward, squinting at the date.* "You can read the date, though. January 31, 2001."

Kurisu: *I nod, my eyes scanning the rest of the report.* "The location is... Pau, France, I guess."

Kurisu: *I read out the next report, trying to keep my voice steady.* "’Jellyman’s Report 8.’ ’Subject: Linda Hill, Age: 25, British’ ’Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2004-2-15 T 13:45’ ’Results: Error. Human is Dead. Mismatch.’ ’October 2, 1972. The gelified body of a woman was discovered on the streets of Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu, India.’ ’There were signs that the body had been run over by a car.’"

Kurisu: *I swallow hard, bracing myself for the next report.* "’Jellyman’s Report 7.’ ’Subject: Michael Lang, Age: 33, German’ ’Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2002-10-8 T 13:28’ ’Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.’"
