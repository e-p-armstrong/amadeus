Planning stage:

Characters:

- Okabe: An eccentric and dramatic character, who refers to himself as a mad scientist. He's also highly intelligent, and can be serious when the situation calls for it. His actions and thoughts will reflect a sense of seriousness and anxiety in this scene due to the shocking information he's uncovering.

- Kurisu: A genius neuroscientist who is typically serious and pragmatic. She doesn't easily show her emotions and is usually calm and composed, even in tense situations. Her actions will reflect her trying to maintain her composure, despite the disturbing nature of the information she's reading.

- Itaru: A talented hacker and one of Okabe's closest friends. He's usually relaxed and laid back, but can be serious when needed. His actions will reflect his concern and shock as they uncover more about SERN's experiments.

Anchor Lines:

1. Okabe: "More Jellymen? That means more gelified people... more victims of human experimentation..."
2. Kurisu: "’Jellyman’s Report 9.’ ’Subject: Dan Strayski, Age: 26, Canadian.’ ’Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2004-9-6 T 14:10.’ ’Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.’ The newspaper clipping... I think it’s in French. I can’t read it."

Thematic Direction: The scene is filled with a sense of dread and shock as the characters uncover the horrifying reality of SERN's experiments. The anchor lines will be enhanced to emphasize the gravity of the situation and the characters' reaction to it.

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I keep my voice steady, maintaining a calm facade despite the grimace tugging at the corner of my lips.* "And this means they’ve created a time machine, doesn’t it? Even if it’s not perfect."

Okabe: *The words catch in my throat, echoing hollowly in my mind.* "Eh...?"

Kurisu: *I glance at Okabe, then back at the article.* "This New York Times article is from 1921."

Okabe: *A chill runs down my spine, the reality of the situation sinking in.* "90 years ago..."

Kurisu: *I point to a section of the black and white photograph, my fingers trembling ever so slightly.* "Look."

Okabe: *I follow her gaze, a cold shiver running down my spine as I recognize the logo.* "SERN..."

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, my brows furrowing in concern.* "So... SERN used the LHC to send someone back to 1921?"

Kurisu: *I nod grimly, my eyes never leaving the horrifying image.* "Looks like they failed to keep him alive, though."

Okabe: *I clench my fists, swallowing the lump in my throat.* "Is this the only report?"

Itaru: *I shake my head, clicking through the files on the screen.* "No, there’s more. Looks like... 14 people in total."

Okabe: *I force the words out, my voice barely above a whisper as the implications hit me.* "More Jellymen? That means more gelified people... more victims of human experimentation..." *I reach for a cold Dr P in the fridge, trying to quench the parched feeling in my throat.* "Show me the others."

Kurisu: *As Itaru pulls up another report, I start translating out loud, my voice void of any emotion.* "’Jellyman’s Report 9.’ ’Subject: Dan Strayski, Age: 26, Canadian.’ ’Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2004-9-6 T 14:10.’ ’Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.’ The newspaper clipping... I think it’s in French. I can’t read it."

Okabe: *I lean forward, squinting at the date.* "You can read the date, though. January 31, 2001."

Kurisu: *I nod, my eyes scanning the rest of the report.* "The location is... Pau, France, I guess."

Kurisu: *I read out the next report, trying to keep my voice steady.* "’Jellyman’s Report 8.’ ’Subject: Linda Hill, Age: 25, British’ ’Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2004-2-15 T 13:45’ ’Results: Error. Human is Dead. Mismatch.’ ’October 2, 1972. The gelified body of a woman was discovered on the streets of Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu, India.’ ’There were signs that the body had been run over by a car.’"

Kurisu: *I swallow hard, bracing myself for the next report.* "’Jellyman’s Report 7.’ ’Subject: Michael Lang, Age: 33, German’ ’Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2002-10-8 T 13:28’ ’Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.’"
