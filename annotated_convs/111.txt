Itaru: *I squint at the screen, my fingers poised over the keyboard.* "Should we keep looking?" 

Okabe: *I glance away from the screen, my mind reeling from the information overload.* "I’ve seen enough."

Okabe: *My eyes widen in realization.* Fourteen... Fourteen of these people?

Kurisu: *I lean back in my chair, my brow furrowing in thought.* "The sites are spread throughout the world. What can we deduce from this?"

Okabe: *I stroke my chin, my gaze distant.* "They must have sent them to those places."

Kurisu: *I shake my head, crossing my arms over my chest.* "I don’t think so. It’s too random."

Itaru: *I scratch my head, my eyes glazing over.* "There was something about Kerr black holes and gravity, right? Isn’t that the cause?"

Kurisu: *I nod, recalling the document.* "'It is believed that due to infinite compression by supergravity, the subject could not endure passage through the Kerr black hole’s singularity.’ That’s what it said."

Itaru: *I frown, trying to make sense of the jargon.* "What’s a Kerr black hole? Is it different from a regular black hole?"

Kurisu: *I sigh, rubbing my temples.* "It’s a theoretical black hole with a rotating singularity. Their existence hasn’t been proven yet. Not that there’s any way to prove one exists."

Okabe: *I tap my fingers on the table, my mind racing.* Kerr black hole. Where have I heard that term before?

Okabe: *I snap my fingers, realization dawning on me.* "That’s right... John Titor!"

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest as the pieces fall into place.* Titor said his time machine used Kerr black holes.

Okabe: *I lean forward, my eyes wide with anticipation.* "According to Titor, SERN finished their time machine in 2034. And then Titor himself came from 2036."

Okabe: *I glance at Kurisu, my mind whirling.* It makes sense for Titor and SERN to be using the same time travel technology. Kurisu closes her eyes in deep thought.

Kurisu: *I shake my head, disbelief tingeing my voice.* "Creating Kerr black holes? That’s insane. If you screw up, it could swallow the Earth... and besides, Kerr black holes are just a theoretical construct."

Okabe: *I nod, my gaze fixed on the screen.* "If Titor’s predictions are a reality, then that means the LHC worst case scenario video on MewTube was right."

Itaru: *I shrug, my expression nonchalant.* "I don’t know about Titor’s predictions, but I’ve seen the problem video before. It was on the news two or three years ago."

Kurisu: *I lean forward, my voice steady and serious.* "The gravitational forces inside a black hole are unbelievably powerful. It’s certainly possible that passing through one could allow time displacement, but there’s no way a human could do that and come out alive."

Okabe: *I clench my fists, my heart heavy with dread.* "That must be how these people got gelified."

Kurisu: *I shake my head, my eyes filled with a grim determination.* "It wouldn’t just gelify you. It would tear you apart particle from particle. That’s what a black hole does."

Itaru: *I glance at Okabe, my hand hovering over the mouse.* "Before we discuss this, shouldn’t we look through the rest of their time machine research?"

Okabe: *I watch as Daru starts pulling up new documents, a sense of dread creeping over me.* Is it okay to keep hacking SERN like this? Should I stop him? I’m the one who asked him to do it, but things have gotten serious now. But at the same time, irresistible curiosity wells up inside me. Time travel is becoming a reality. I want to know that it’s true. I can’t stop now.

Itaru: *I grin, my fingers flying over the keyboard.* "Here we go! There’s a file in the Z Program that explains time travel theory."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, a hint of amusement in my voice.* "That was pretty easy to find. SERN should have better security."

Itaru: *I chuckle, leaning back in my chair.* "Their security’s fine. I’m just too good."

Okabe: *I smile, a hint of pride in my voice.* "Daru is my Favorite Right Arm."

Kurisu: *I smirk, crossing my arms over my chest.* "I thought he was your super hacka."

Itaru: *I groan, rolling my eyes.* "Hacker!"

Okabe: *I turn to Kurisu, a playful grin on my face.* "So what does it say, Christina?"

Okabe: *I peer at the screen, squinting at the English text.* This is in English too, so I have no choice but to rely on my assistant.

Kurisu: *I frown, my eyes scanning the document.* "Umm... can you give me some time to read it?"
