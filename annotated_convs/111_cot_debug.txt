Kurisu: "...Huh?" *She looks at me, confusion etched on her face.*

Okabe: *Pulling out my phone, I quickly bring up the calendar.* "I assume it'll be during summer break. Make sure you let me know ahead of time."

Kurisu: "Wha-wha-wha-what are you talking about!?" *She sputters, her face turning red.*

Okabe: "I might have plans. I'll need to shift my schedule around." *I say, trying to hold back a smile at her reaction.*

Kurisu: "Hold on a second! Don't tell me you plan on coming along!?" *She exclaims, her eyes wide with shock.*

Okabe: "Of course I do. You are my assistant, and I will do whatever it takes to ensure that you are in peak mental condition for the experiment." *I state, trying to sound as serious as possible.*

Kurisu: *She blinks at me, looking completely dumbfounded.* "Ok, you've had your fun. I'm in no mood for--"

Okabe: "I'm being completely serious." *I interrupt her, looking straight into her eyes.* "I'll go anywhere you want -- anywhere in Japan. I'd go anywhere in the world, but I don't have a passport or money."

Kurisu: "Okabe..." *She says softly, her eyes filled with a mixture of surprise and gratitude.*

Okabe: "You're afraid you won't know what to say, right?" *I ask, reaching out to place a comforting hand on her shoulder.*

Kurisu: "Yeah..." *She admits, her voice barely a whisper.*

Okabe: "Then that settles it. I am a master of conversation. You will have nothing to fear with Hououin Kyouma at your side!" *I declare, striking a dramatic pose.*

Kurisu: "...pfft!" *She snorts, trying to suppress a laugh.*

Okabe: "Why are you laughing!?" *I ask, feigning offense.*

Kurisu: "You couldn't hold a normal conversation if your life depended on it." *She teases, finally allowing herself a small smile.*

Okabe: *I sigh, realizing the truth in her words.* "Ah..."

Kurisu: "But... thanks anyway. I definitely didn't expect you to offer to come... N-not that I'm happy about it or anything! I hate how you act like a nice guy sometimes! It's confusing!" *She quickly looks away, a blush spreading across her cheeks.*

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, puzzled by her outburst.* 

Kurisu: "Um, Okabe? That offer... I can take you up on it, right?" *She asks hesitantly, looking back at me with a hopeful expression.*

Okabe: "Of course." *I reply, giving her a reassuring nod.*

Kurisu: "Then, once we're done upgrading the PhoneWave... I want you to come with me." *She says, a determined look in her eyes.*

Okabe: "As you wish. Where is your father, anyway?" *I ask, bracing myself for her answer.*

Kurisu: "Aomori." *She says, watching my reaction closely.*

Okabe: "Aomori!?" *I exclaim in surprise.*

Kurisu: "That's where he lives now." *She confirms, her gaze unwavering.*

Okabe: *I let out a sigh, trying to process this new information.* 

Kurisu: "What? You're not going to back out, are you? You already promised. I'm taking you whether you like it or not, okay!?" *She declares, her eyes burning with determination.*
