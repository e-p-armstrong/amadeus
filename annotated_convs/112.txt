*Moeka's lips curve into a smile* as she stands unsteadily and staggers off into the crowd.

Moeka: "Hehehe..."

Mayuri: "What do you think is wrong with Moeka-san?" *She asks me, her eyes filled with worry.*

Okabe: *I shrug nonchalantly, my eyes still on Moeka's retreating figure.* "Muha, muhahaha, MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"

Mayuri: "Whaaah? Now Okarin's acting weird! Mayushii's worried..."

Okabe: *I stop my laughter abruptly, turning to Mayuri with a reassuring smile.* "Don't worry, Mayushii. I'm just messing around."

*Kurisu looks up from her computer screen as I enter the lab, quickly closing the window she was looking at.*

Kurisu: "H-hey! Think you could knock!?" *She stammers, her cheeks flushing slightly.*

Okabe: "This isn't your room. Besides, I'd have to be a fool to knock. There could be assassins lying in ambush." *I reply, setting my bags down on the floor.*

Kurisu: "Assassins? Here? Are you stupid?" *She asks, rolling her eyes at me.*

Okabe: "Anyway, Christina. What were you looking at just now, hmm?" *I ask, making my way over to the computer.*

Kurisu: "S-stay back!" *She tries to block me, but I slip past her and restore the minimized window.*

Okabe: "...pfft!" *I try to hold back my laughter, but fail miserably.*

Kurisu: "Hey! What's with that 'this is awful, rofl rofl' laughter!?" *She frowns, crossing her arms over her chest.*

Okabe: "Have no fear, Christina. Or should I call you... @channeler Chris!" *I tease, unable to contain my amusement.*

Kurisu: "Don't call me that!" *She says, her frown deepening.*

Okabe: "Heh heh heh, I already knew. That's right! I realized long ago that you were an @channeler! You can't hide it from me. You reek of @channel corruption!" *I tell her, grinning confidently.*

Kurisu: "How rude! I make sure to apply light perfume every day!" *She retorts, her cheeks flushed with annoyance.*

Okabe: "Fool. That's not what I meant. I'm talking about the scent of your soul." *I explain, my grin turning into a smirk.*

Kurisu: "My soul? What's that supposed to mean? Explain." *She demands, her eyes narrowing suspiciously.*

Okabe: "Why? So you can learn how to hide it?" *I ask, chuckling lightly.*

Kurisu: "Sh-shut up! Just explain already." *She insists, her irritation clear.*

Okabe: "There's nothing to explain. You use @channel memes in conversation. I'd have to be stupid not to notice." *I tell her, waving a hand dismissively.*

Kurisu: "...Feels bad, man." *She mumbles, looking away.*

Okabe: "That's an @channel meme too." *I point out, my smirk widening.*

Kurisu: "Ugh..." *She groans, rubbing her temples.*

Okabe: "Your soul is tainted with the essence of @channel. You cannot hide it, not in such close proximity to another who uses @channel memes in actual conversation. Your souls resonate." *I say, my tone serious.*

Kurisu: "That's it! It's all Hashida's fault!" *She exclaims, throwing her hands up in exasperation.*

Okabe: "But it's cute how you try to hide it, @channeler Chris." *I tease, chuckling softly.*

Kurisu: "DON'T CALL ME THAT." *She glares at me, her cheeks flushed with anger.*

Okabe: "But I don't understand. You were raised in America, so how are you so familiar with @channel?" *I ask, leaning back in my chair.*

Kurisu: "You can browse @channel from America. Need I say more?" *She replies, her arms crossed defensively.*

Okabe: "Ahh, I get it. Living in an English-only environment made you hungry for Japanese. But did you have to resort to @channel?" *I ask, raising an eyebrow.*

Kurisu: "Sure, it's not the friendliest place, but I couldn't find anywhere that felt more 'Japanese'. Anyway, can I ask a favor?" *She asks, her tone softening slightly.*
