Okabe: "If you have something to say, say it." *I tilt my head, trying to catch her words.*

Kurisu: "Don't tell anyone else about this." *She finally manages, her voice just above a whisper. Her sullen expression doesn't change, but her cheeks are a bright red.*

Okabe: "What difference does it make?" *I chuckle, trying to ease her discomfort.* "Daru's the most hardcore @channeler who ever lived, and Mayuri's an otaku too. Even I browse @channel regularly. There's nothing to be ashamed of! Just boldly write 'Hobbies: Browsing @channel' on your resume!"

Kurisu: "Not a chance, you idiot!" *She snaps, her embarrassment turning into annoyance.*

Okabe: "What!? You mean you'd rather post anchors on VIP!?" *I tease, a smirk playing on my lips.*

Kurisu: "Gh, I hate myself for understanding those words!" *She groans, burying her face in her hands.*

Okabe: "Well, whatever. If it will help you focus on the time leap machine, I'll keep your secret for now. Besides, it's just a matter of time before you make another mistake and reveal your true colors." *I lean back, crossing my arms over my chest.*

Kurisu: "You don't have to worry about me. Remember that I represented my entire laboratory when we presented our research, even though there were men twice my age on the project. I'm an expert at dealing with people. I'll have no trouble keeping it a secret." *She asserts, trying to regain her composure.*

Okabe: "...Nullpo." *I say, a mischievous glint in my eyes.*

Kurisu: "Gah! No...!" *Her face turns an even deeper shade of red, and she lets out a frustrated sigh.*
