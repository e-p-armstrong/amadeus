Kurisu: *My brow furrows as I attempt to explain the complexities of time travel.* "Titor’s explanation on that point was vague. He mentioned having such a device, but he didn’t explain how it worked."

Itaru: *Leaning back in my chair, I stroke my chin thoughtfully.* "But if you’re only moving through time, won’t you just arrive in the same location?"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, a hint of impatience in my voice.* "Of course not."

Itaru: *I tilt my head, confusion apparent in my voice.* "Why not?"

Okabe: *I cut in, my voice filled with the theatricality I'm known for.* "Because the Earth is always moving."

Kurisu: *I nod in agreement, launching into a scientific explanation.* "Right. Rotation and revolution. The Earth’s rotational velocity is about 1, 650 kilometers per hour. Its orbital velocity around the sun is about 114, 000 kilometers per hour. Meaning one hour ago, we were that far away from where we are now."

Itaru: *I whistle in awe, my eyes wide.* "Whoa! When you think about it like that, we’re earth-shatteringly fast!"

Kurisu: *I continue, my voice steady and factual.* "And that’s not all. The Solar System is part of the Milky Way. And the Milky Way spins like a giant whirlpool. There are various theories, but basically the earth moves about 50 million kilometers a day."

Okabe: *I watch her in amazement, wondering how she can roll all those numbers so smoothly off her tongue. I get that she’s a genius, but it’s hardly common knowledge. Has she been doing research on the topic?* 

Itaru: *I chuckle, running a hand through my hair.* "We’ve kinda gotten to a ludicrous scale."

Kurisu: *I pause for a moment before diving deeper into the topic.* "By the way, the Milky Way is part of a large cluster of galaxies, which is itself part of an even larger supercluster. And these clusters and superclusters might be moving too. If that’s the case, we’re moving even more than 50 million kilometers a day." *I take a deep breath, preparing to deliver the crux of my explanation.* "The point is that setting the destination would require insane calculations, even if you only want to travel one second into the past. Doing it by hand is impossible, and it might take years for a supercomputer to come up with a solution, just to get you to the same location."

Okabe: *I rub my temples, feeling the weight of our predicament.* "Then we have no choice. We need to find Titor and borrow his variable gravity system."

Kurisu: *I shrug, my tone nonchalant yet laced with sarcasm.* "Great idea. Go for it. I wonder how SERN is dealing with this problem..." *After blowing me off, I watch as Kurisu goes back to reading SERN’s documents. Daru and I aren’t good with English, so there’s nothing we can do but let her work. Dawn breaks. We stayed up all night again. Fighting drowsiness, I refill my mug with instant coffee. I’ve already lost count of how many I’ve had.*

Kurisu: *Her voice cuts through my thoughts.* "Okabe."
