Okabe: *Gulping, I skim through the contents of the email on my phone. The sight sends a chill down my spine. I quickly delete the email and glance around nervously.* *With fear gripping my heart, I start rushing back to the lab. Bursting through the door, I lock it behind me and take a moment to catch my breath.* *However, as I look around, I notice the absence of Mayuri and Kurisu.* Ah... *I feel a wave of dread wash over me. Their bags were still here, the lights were still on, and the door had been unlocked.* *Suddenly, a sound catches my attention. The sound of running water. The shower.* *Images of a horrific scene flash through my mind, fueling my panic.* "Is everyone okay!?" *I shout as I slam open the door to the shower room.*

Kurisu: "Kyaaa! What are you doing!?" *She screams in surprise and embarrassment.* 

Okabe: "Ah. So Christina really does have a birthmark on her bu--" *I start, but am cut off by her loud exclamation.*

Kurisu: "NO!" *She yells, her face turning bright red with embarrassment.*
