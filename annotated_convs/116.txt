Mayuri: *Stepping into the room with a convenience store bag swinging from my hand, I beam at my friends.* "Tutturu♪ Good morning! Oh wait, should I say, good afternoon?"

Okabe: *I watch as Mayuri enters, her presence instantly lightening the somber atmosphere in the room.* "It seems the day has already slipped away from us."

Mayuri: *I giggle, looking around at the exhausted faces.* "Whoo! The air in here is sooo thick." *With an energetic bounce, I move to the window, pushing it open.* "I’ll refresh the air!" 

Okabe: *As the fresh air streams in, I rise from my chair, stretching my tired muscles. Glancing at the clock, I clear my throat, commanding attention.* "Since all lab mems are present and accounted for, this is the perfect opportunity to hold another Round Table Conference."

Mayuri: *Tilting my head, I give Okabe a puzzled look.* "Roundabout confluence?"

Itaru: *Rubbing my eyes, I peer at Okabe from behind my glasses.* "...What’s that?"

Okabe: *I wave my hand dismissively, a smirk playing on my lips.* "A meeting of lab mems."

Itaru: *I scratch my head, a bemused expression on my face.* "Have we ever done that before?"

Kurisu: *I set my coffee cup down, raising an eyebrow at Okabe.* "Do you even have a round table?"

Okabe: *With a flourish of my hand, I strike a dramatic pose.* "Not physically. However, it exists in the hearts of all lab mems. Am I mistaken?"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Yes, you’re mistaken. Don’t go sticking things in people’s hearts."

Mayuri: *My eyes widen in surprise.* "Is there one in Mayushii too?"

Okabe: *I nod solemnly, meeting Mayuri's gaze.* "Of course there is."

Mayuri: *I smile, relieved.* "Oh, that’s good. But what’s a roundable?"

Itaru: *I chuckle, leaning back in my chair.* "And why a round table? You King Arthur?"

Kurisu: *I sigh, rubbing my temples.* "I’m only a temporary lab mem anyway."

Okabe: *I throw up my hands, exasperated.* "Anyway, it’s a Round Table Conference! Mayuri wasn’t here last night, so first, let’s explain the situation to her."

Mayuri: *Listening intently, I feel a shiver run down my spine.* "I told you you shouldn’t do bad things."

Okabe: *My eyes harden, and I clench my fist.* "Hmph, ’bad’ you say? We are bad? Absurd. If we’re bad, then SERN is even worse. They aren’t satisfied with ruling the world. Now they want to get their hands on space-time itself!"

Kurisu: *I nod, my gaze steady and serious.* "I agree. What SERN is doing is unforgivable. They’re traitors to humanity, to society, and to science."

Mayuri: *I swallow hard, struggling to understand.* "I guess..."

Okabe: *I look at Mayuri, my heart aching for her innocence.* "Anyway, Ragnarok can no longer be averted. The final battle with SERN is near."

Mayuri: *I blink, confused.* "Rag in a rock?"
