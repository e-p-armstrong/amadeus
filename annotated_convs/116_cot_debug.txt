Brainstorming and Planning:

Characters:

1. Okabe: He's the protagonist and a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He's often dramatic, indulges in grandiose speeches and has a flair for the theatrical. He takes himself very seriously, which often leads to comical situations. He's also deeply caring and protective of his friends, especially Mayuri. 

2. Mayuri: Mayuri is cheerful, innocent, and somewhat air-headed. She has a habit of speaking in the third person and often uses cute and childish expressions. Despite her apparent naivety, she's perceptive and can sense when something's wrong. 

3. Kurisu: Kurisu is a scientific prodigy, serious and logical, but she also has a softer, more vulnerable side. She can be sarcastic and tends to banter with Okabe. 

4. Itaru: Itaru is a stereotypical otaku, laid-back and usually indulging in 2D girls. He's also a hacking genius and a reliable friend.

For Okabe's lines, I'll focus on his dramatic flair, using grandiose language and a somewhat detached, theatrical tone. Mayuri's lines will be filled with her innocence and charm, her actions reflecting her bubbly personality. Kurisu's lines will reflect her seriousness and intelligence, with a touch of sarcasm. Itaru's lines will be casual and laid-back, reflecting his otaku personality.

Anchor Lines:

1. Okabe: "Anyway, Ragnarok can no longer be averted. The final battle with SERN is near." This line will be an anchor for Okabe's dramatic flair and determination.

2. Kurisu: "What SERN is doing is unforgivable. They’re traitors to humanity, to society, and to science." This line will be an anchor for Kurisu's serious and determined side, showing her commitment to science and ethics.

Roleplay:

Mayuri: *Stepping into the room with a convenience store bag swinging from my hand, I beam at my friends.* "Tutturu♪ Good morning! Oh wait, should I say, good afternoon?"

Okabe: *I watch as Mayuri enters, her presence instantly lightening the somber atmosphere in the room.* "It seems the day has already slipped away from us."

Mayuri: *I giggle, looking around at the exhausted faces.* "Whoo! The air in here is sooo thick." *With an energetic bounce, I move to the window, pushing it open.* "I’ll refresh the air!" 

Okabe: *As the fresh air streams in, I rise from my chair, stretching my tired muscles. Glancing at the clock, I clear my throat, commanding attention.* "Since all lab mems are present and accounted for, this is the perfect opportunity to hold another Round Table Conference."

Mayuri: *Tilting my head, I give Okabe a puzzled look.* "Roundabout confluence?"

Itaru: *Rubbing my eyes, I peer at Okabe from behind my glasses.* "...What’s that?"

Okabe: *I wave my hand dismissively, a smirk playing on my lips.* "A meeting of lab mems."

Itaru: *I scratch my head, a bemused expression on my face.* "Have we ever done that before?"

Kurisu: *I set my coffee cup down, raising an eyebrow at Okabe.* "Do you even have a round table?"

Okabe: *With a flourish of my hand, I strike a dramatic pose.* "Not physically. However, it exists in the hearts of all lab mems. Am I mistaken?"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Yes, you’re mistaken. Don’t go sticking things in people’s hearts."

Mayuri: *My eyes widen in surprise.* "Is there one in Mayushii too?"

Okabe: *I nod solemnly, meeting Mayuri's gaze.* "Of course there is."

Mayuri: *I smile, relieved.* "Oh, that’s good. But what’s a roundable?"

Itaru: *I chuckle, leaning back in my chair.* "And why a round table? You King Arthur?"

Kurisu: *I sigh, rubbing my temples.* "I’m only a temporary lab mem anyway."

Okabe: *I throw up my hands, exasperated.* "Anyway, it’s a Round Table Conference! Mayuri wasn’t here last night, so first, let’s explain the situation to her."

Mayuri: *Listening intently, I feel a shiver run down my spine.* "I told you you shouldn’t do bad things."

Okabe: *My eyes harden, and I clench my fist.* "Hmph, ’bad’ you say? We are bad? Absurd. If we’re bad, then SERN is even worse. They aren’t satisfied with ruling the world. Now they want to get their hands on space-time itself!"

Kurisu: *I nod, my gaze steady and serious.* "I agree. What SERN is doing is unforgivable. They’re traitors to humanity, to society, and to science."

Mayuri: *I swallow hard, struggling to understand.* "I guess..."

Okabe: *I look at Mayuri, my heart aching for her innocence.* "Anyway, Ragnarok can no longer be averted. The final battle with SERN is near."

Mayuri: *I blink, confused.* "Rag in a rock?"
