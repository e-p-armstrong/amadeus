Okabe: *I slam my hands down on the table, leaning forward with a stern glare.* "Christina! I ordered you to investigate SERN! What have you learned?"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, raising an eyebrow at Okabe's dramatics.* "I don’t remember being ordered, but whatever." *I begin to recount the information, each word chosen carefully.* "There are two problems SERN faces with time travel..."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a confused look in my eyes.* "Why can’t they be found?"

Itaru: *I push up my glasses, a knowing smile on my lips.* "Didn’t you know, Mayu-shi? The world is constantly moving..."

Okabe: *I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief.* So even SERN is having difficulties? *I lean back in my chair, my fingers steepled in thought.* "Now then. Have you learned anything that could help us complete the PhoneWave (name subject to change)?"

Kurisu: "Hmm..." *I stare at the ceiling, deep in thought. After a moment, a small smirk tugs at my lips.* "Well, I suppose you could call the LHC the world’s largest microwave oven."

Okabe: *I gasp, my eyes lighting up with realization.* "Of course! In other words, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is a miniature LHC!"

Kurisu: *I nod, slightly taken aback by his quick acceptance.* "You might be on to something there."

Okabe: *A sense of victory fills me, but it's quickly replaced by a sense of dread.* However, there are too many things we don’t know about the PhoneWave...

Mayuri: "It was made to warm Mayushii’s chicken!" *I say, a bright smile on my face, oblivious to the seriousness of the situation.*

Okabe: "Since the jellyman phenomenon occurs with the PhoneWave (name subject to change), Mayuri’s bananas must be reaching the Kerr black hole’s ring singularity."

Mayuri: *I gasp, my eyes widening in fear.* "It makes a black hole? Here? It won’t suck us in, will it?" *I clutch my chicken plushie tighter, looking around the room anxiously.*

Kurisu: *I shake my head, trying to reassure her.* "But we still haven’t figured out the electric discharge phenomenon, or the conditions required to cause it."

Itaru: "During our experiments earlier, we were only able to send emails to the past during the discharge." *I say, my voice steady and composed.*

Okabe: "Although it hasn’t happened again, that discharge phenomenon could very well signify the injection of charge -- that is, electrons. And only when it occurs does the path to the singularity open."

Kurisu: *I sigh, rubbing my temples in frustration.* "We don’t know the cause of the discharge phenomenon."
