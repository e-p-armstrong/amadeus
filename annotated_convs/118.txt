Okabe: "A little silence please, Mister Braun! This is a most glorious moment, for I have just been chosen as the ruler of all space and time! MUHAHAHAHAHA! Guh!" *I gloat, throwing my head back in a fit of maniacal laughter, only to be rudely interrupted by a sudden sharp pain.*

Tennouji: *His fist lands on the top of my head, his face stern.* "Got somethin' to say?"

Okabe: "Heh... heh heh..." *I shake my head, trying to regain my bearings.* "well then, Mister Braun... put it on my tab!" *I declare before making a hasty retreat.*

Okabe: "All's well that ends well!" *I chuckle to myself, rubbing the top of my head as I reenter the lab.* "Muhahaha!"

Mayuri: *She rushes over, her eyes wide with concern.* "Okarin! The building just shook. Are you okay?"

Kurisu: *She looks out from the second story window, a teasing smile on her face.* "Looks like you really are unkillable."

Okabe: "Heh heh heh." *I give her a confident smirk.* "I have seen the future, Christina. In three minutes, you will be on your knees praising my greatness!"

Kurisu: *She crosses her arms, looking down at me skeptically.* "I don't think so."

Okabe: *I rush up the stairs, eager to prove my point.* "Why are you blaming me?"

Kurisu: "...I'm not blaming you. I'm just disappointed that nobody, including myself, noticed." *She says, looking at the PhoneWave thoughtfully.*

Itaru: "We missed the forest for the trees." *He adds, shaking his head in disbelief.*

Okabe: "To summarize..." *I start, gesturing towards the PhoneWave.* "Just now, when the PhoneWave (name subject to change) shook the building, the 42-inch CRT was on. But when Mister Braun turned the TV off, the shaking stopped immediately."

Kurisu: "The discharge was interrupted. I put a banana in just to be sure. Nothing happened." *She explains, her tone clinical.*

Mayuri: "I'm glad. We shouldn't waste food." *She says with a soft smile, clearly relieved.*

Kurisu: "We've found the answer. The electrons emitted by the 42-inch CRT are holding the PhoneWave's black hole open. And the discharge phenomenon is the result." *She concludes, a satisfied expression on her face.*

Itaru: "So the reason we can't use the PhoneWave at night is because the Braun Tube Workshop's closed?" *He asks, looking at the device with newfound understanding.*

Okabe: "But how can a cathode ray tube emit such a strong electron stream?" *I question, trying to make sense of the new information.*

Kurisu: "It's not about having a strong electron stream. If stronger were better, SERN would've solved the lifter problem long ago." *She explains, her eyes sharp.*

Okabe: "Somehow, the conditions here were perfect to create a time machine. Frankly, it's a miracle." *I summarize, looking at the PhoneWave with a newfound sense of awe.*

Kurisu: "No, Christina! Not a miracle! This is the choice of Steins Gate!" *I declare, turning to her with a triumphant grin.*

Kurisu: "Whatever it is, it worked." *She shoots me an exasperated smile, shaking her head slightly in amusement.*
