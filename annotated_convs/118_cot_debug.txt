Planning stage:

In this scene, we have four characters:

1. Kurisu: She is intelligent, logical, and a bit of a tsundere. Her actions and thoughts should reflect her analytical mind and her slight reluctance to fully engage in the eccentricity of the others. 

2. Okabe: He is eccentric, dramatic, and passionate about his inventions. His actions and thoughts should be theatrical and grandiose.

3. Mayuri: She is innocent, kind, and a bit naive. Her actions and thoughts should be simple, sweet, and full of wonder.

4. Itaru: He is a laid-back and cheerful otaku. His actions and thoughts should reflect his casual nature and his love for pop culture references.

The key anchors in this scene are Okabe's dramatic announcement of his chosen name for the phenomenon and Mayuri's innocent question that ends up causing a bit of a stir. The first should be filled with theatrics and grandeur, while the second should be endearing and a little sad.

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, my brow furrowing in thought.* "In the first place, the emails we’re sending to the past are digital data, not physical objects. That’s a definite difference from SERN’s time machine."

Okabe: *I slam my hand down on the table, leaning forward with an intense gleam in my eyes.* "No, we’re doing the same thing. Who’s to say that digital data can’t go through a singularity? I think it would be easier than sending something human-sized."

Kurisu: *I tilt my head slightly, considering his words.* "Well... I suppose that’s true."

Mayuri: *I look up from my jelly, a faraway look in my eyes.* "You know, the way you guys talk about email... It makes me think of folding a letter into a paper airplane and making it go zoom, you know?"

Okabe: *I spread my arms wide, as if painting a picture in the air.* "It’s more like a beam of light. Like optical digital data. By the way, it’s a pain to keep saying ’email sent to the past’. Let’s give it a proper name."

Kurisu: *I sigh, rubbing my temples.* "I’ve got a bad feeling about this."

Okabe: *I point accusingly at Kurisu, my voice rising in indignation.* "What’s that supposed to mean? You dare mock Hououin Kyouma!?"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes at his theatrics.* "You just want to give it some oddball name, don’t you?"

Okabe: *I let out a huff of annoyance, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Hmph! How rude. Heed me! I shall name the phenomenon of ’email sent to the past’ as follows. The name shall be... Nostalgia Drive!"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, a smirk tugging at the corner of my lips.* "Confusing. Rejected."

Okabe: *I feel my face heating up in anger.* "Why you! Who gave you the authority to reject my ideas!? You’re just an assistant!"

Kurisu: *I shrug, an innocent look on my face.* "Then why don’t we take a vote? All in favor of Nostalgia Drive."

Okabe: *I thrust my hand into the air, waiting for the others to join me. But no one does.* "Have you forsaken me, Daru!? Mayuri!?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a confused look on my face.* "Chris-chan’s right. It’s too hard for Mayushii to remember."

Itaru: *I shrug, not meeting Okabe's eyes.* "It’s way too chuuni, man."

Okabe: *I feel a pang of betrayal.* "Fine! Then let’s hear alternatives! Don’t tell me you rejected my idea without having any bright ideas of your own!?"

Kurisu: *I smile, already having a suggestion in mind.* "I think it needs to be something easy to understand. It’s an email that regresses through time, so how about Retromail?"

Mayuri: *I look up from my jelly, my brows furrowed in confusion.* "What does ’retro’ mean?"

Okabe: *I smirk at Kurisu, feeling a sense of victory.* "Sounds like you have your answer, Christina. You said it should be easy to understand, but it wasn’t easy to understand at all, was it!?"

Kurisu: *I blush, quickly looking away.* "B-but that’s because Mayuri-san is... Uh, n-never mind..."

Okabe: *I lean in, a teasing smile on my face.* "Were you about to say ’because Mayuri’s dumb’?"

Kurisu: *I shake my head frantically, my cheeks burning.* "N-no!"

Mayuri: *I look at Kurisu, a hurt look in my eyes.* "Eh? Chris-chan, do you think Mayushii’s dumb?"

Kurisu: *I quickly reach out, grabbing Mayuri's hands.* "I don’t! I promise I don’t! Okay?"

Itaru: *I raise my hand, a smirk on my face.* "I vote ’The Mail Who Leapt through Time’."

Okabe: *I shake my head, dismissing the suggestion.* "That’s too stiff. It’s hard to say."

Itaru: *I frown at Okabe, feeling a bit annoyed.* "It’s better than your ’Nostalagisticexpialidocious’ nonsense! And mine makes a movie title referen--"

Okabe: *I wave my hand dismissively, interrupting Itaru.* "That’s not cool. It needs to be cool."

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow at Okabe, clearly not understanding his logic.* "You’re rejecting it for that?"

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes wide and bright with anticipation.* "Tutturu♪ Mayushii has an idea! How about ’Back to the Mail’? I took a movie title, and changed a word to mail!"
