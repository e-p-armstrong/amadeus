Mayuri: "So, um, what do we have to do to complete Super PhoneWave-chan?" *She absentmindedly twirls a thread around her finger, looking at Kurisu with a questioning gaze.*

Kurisu: "Now that we've found the cause, there's nothing left to hold us back. We can safely conclude that time leaping is possible when, and only when, that television is on." *She states, her eyes shining with determination.*

Itaru: "We should probably test it, right? And there's still the final check of the PhoneWave to do." *He glances between Kurisu and me, nervously adjusting his glasses.*

Kurisu: "You're right. Okabe." *She turns to me, her eyes expectant.*

Okabe: "What?" *I respond, feigning innocence.*

Kurisu: "Go downstairs and turn that TV back on." *She instructs, pointing towards the stairs.*

Okabe: "Ha. Ha. Ha. That's hilarious, Christina. Allow me to dub that... Mission: Impossible!" *I snort in derision, crossing my arms over my chest.*

Kurisu: "Whatever. Just go already." *She rolls her eyes, her tone exasperated.*

Okabe: "Assistant mine... have you finally recognized my greatness as a mad scientist?" *I smirk, raising an eyebrow at her.*

Kurisu: "No." *She shoots back flatly, causing Itaru to chuckle.*

Okabe: "Ah." *I feign disappointment, my hand on my heart.*

Itaru: "Damn. That was harsh." *He snickers, nudging me playfully.*

Kurisu: "Oh, whoops. I was supposed to flatter him so he'd feel like going, right? Yes, you're an amazing mad scientist." *She corrects herself, her tone dripping with sarcasm.*

Okabe: "It's too late!" *I dismiss her with a wave of my hand.*

Kurisu: "Anyway, now that we've found the lifter, the time leap machine is 99% complete." *She announces, a serious expression replacing her earlier playful ones. There's a calculated intensity in her gaze that leaves no doubt about her passion for this project.*

Okabe: "I will become the undisputed lord of time. With that power, I will shatter the System and Chaos will rule the--"

Kurisu: "Okabe." *She interrupts, her voice firm.*

Okabe: *I pause, taken aback by her interruption.*

Kurisu: "I wasn't asking Hououin Kyouma. I was asking Okabe." *She states, her gaze softening as she looks at me.*
