Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, my brow furrowing as I dissect the words.* "Besides, I think the meaning is a little off."

Okabe: *I ponder her words, a realization dawning on me.* She probably meant Mail to the Future, but our emails go to the past.

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, my voice chiming in innocently.* "It’s not about the meaning... I took a movie title and changed a word to mail..."

Okabe: *I wave my hand dismissively, my voice sharp.* "Either way, it’s too long!"

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, a smirk playing on my lips.* "Then how about DeLorean Mail?"

Okabe: *I scoff, throwing my hands up in exasperation.* "That doesn’t even say what kind of email it is!"

Kurisu: *I rub my temples, my patience wearing thin.* "Hey. We don’t have time for this nonsense. Let’s just abbreviate it to ’D-Mail’ and move on."

Okabe: *I pout, crossing my arms over my chest.* "But that’s boring."

Kurisu: *I glance at him, my voice firm and resolute.* "I don’t care if it’s boring."

Okabe: *I feel a twinge of disappointment.* Shot down. Kurisu’s influence in the lab seems to have grown significantly these past few days.

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes sparkling with determination.* "D-Mail it is!"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, caught off guard.* Mayuri, finished with her jelly, proclaims in satisfaction. Wait, when did Mayuri become the moderator?

Itaru: *I scratch my head, a thoughtful look on my face.* "So why does the D-Mail phenomenon occur?"

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, my tone a mix of frustration and impatience.* "Because the path through the ring singularity is open. We’ve been over this already."

Kurisu: *I interject, my voice steady and calm.* "We don’t know if there’s actually a black hole at work here. It could be an entirely different phenomenon that just happens to resemble SERN’s experiments. It’s dangerous to jump to conclusions."

Okabe: *I lean forward, my eyes blazing with determination.* "Why so timid? Don’t you want our time travel experiments to succeed? That’s why we put our lives on the line to hack SERN! What we need to figure out is how to turn the PhoneWave (name subject to change) into a usable time machine."

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, a hint of skepticism in my voice.* "Do you really think that’s possible?"

Okabe: *I pound my fist on the table, my voice filled with conviction.* "There is no think. Only do!"

Kurisu: *I laugh, shaking my head in disbelief.* "What, did you read that off a motivational poster? You’re like the classic incompetent boss."

Okabe: *I stand up abruptly, my voice echoing through the room.* "Damn you! You dare insult the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!?"

Itaru: *I chuckle, a smirk tugging at the corner of my mouth.* "Well, it’s not like Okarin’s the boss anyway."

Okabe: *I smirk, my chest puffing out with pride.* "Indeed. I am the symbol of this lab, not the boss."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, my gaze fixed on him.* "I don’t know what you mean by symbol, but how do you plan to turn the PhoneWave into a time machine? Let’s have details."

Okabe: *I pause, gathering my thoughts.* "My plan... alright, there is one thing. We’ve been thinking that the electrical discharge happens at random, but I have a hypothesis."

Kurisu: *I lean forward, my interest piqued.* "Which is?"

Okabe: *I glance at my watch, noting the time.* It’s past noon. "Recall the conditions when it occurred, Christina. We experimented through the night with no results, but there’s one variable we overlooked. The simplest, most definitive variable of all. That is, the time of the occurrence."

Kurisu: *Her eyes widen, a spark of realization lighting up her face.* "...ah."

Okabe: *I nod, my voice steady and confident.* "I checked the times of the two previous occurrences. When I accidentally sent the first D-Mail to Daru’s phone, it happened between noon and one PM. The second time, when all four of us observed the D-Mail, it was six PM. So if we perform the experiment within that timeframe, we might be able to reproduce the effect."

Kurisu: *Her eyes gleam with excitement, and she jumps to her feet.* "Let’s try it right now!"

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu bolts into the development room, suddenly bursting with enthusiasm.*

Itaru: *I chuckle, shaking my head in amusement.* "Well, I’m glad to see she has her priorities straight."
