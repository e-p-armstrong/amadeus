Okabe: *I survey the table, my eyes lingering on the single banana that remains untouched. The other bananas have been dealt with - eaten or transformed into a gel-like substance in our experiment.*

Kurisu: *I turn to Mayuri, my voice filled with regret.* "Sorry, Mayuri-san. I’ll go buy you some new bananas later."

Mayuri: *My eyes light up at Kurisu's promise.* "Really? Yay♪ Okarin and Daru-kun eat my bananas, but they never buy new ones..."

Okabe: *I make a mental note to rectify this in the future. It's a small price to pay for the world-shaking experiments we conduct here. I watch as Kurisu picks up the last banana, bends down, and places it into the microwave.* 

Kurisu: *I straighten up, only to hit my head on the table.* "First, let’s see if it’ll become a jellyman. Agh!"

Okabe: *I chuckle at Kurisu's clumsiness.* "Trying for the clumsy girl appeal?"

Kurisu: *I rub my head, my cheeks flushed with embarrassment.* "It was an accident!"

Kurisu: *My voice is slightly shaky as I point at the microwave.* "Put the microwave somewhere else! It’s dangerous and hard to reach like this."

Okabe: *I shrug, my tone dismissive.* "It’ll punch through the floor if we put it on the table."

Mayuri: *I gently pat the back of Kurisu's head, singing a comforting rhyme.* "Chris-chan, Chris-chan! Pain, pain, go away♪"

Kurisu: *I give Mayuri a small smile, feeling a bit better.* "Thanks, Mayuri-san."

Kurisu: *I regain my composure and start the microwave, watching as the banana inside slowly spins backwards.*

Kurisu: *My eyes widen as the banana vanishes, only to reappear on its stem, gelified.* "Ah!"

Itaru: *I lean in to get a better look, my voice filled with awe.* "Whoa!"

Mayuri: *I point at the transformed banana, my voice filled with wonder.* "It became a gelbana..."

Okabe: *I throw my head back and laugh, the thrill of success coursing through me.* "Heh heh heh... muhahaha... MUHAHAHAHA! Just as I suspected, the critical variable was time!"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, a mix of annoyance and admiration on my face.* "W-way to go, Okabe. It was so simple, I didn’t notice it."

Okabe: *I lean back, a smug grin on my face.* "Your praise does you credit, Christina, but I know you’re frustrated you didn’t think of it first. Muhahahaha!"

Kurisu: *I quickly shift the topic, eager to keep the momentum going.* "Anyway, let’s see if we can send another D-Mail."

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu starts typing out a mail, my pride slightly wounded.* "Guh... I feel like my authority has been on the decline since that girl showed up."

Itaru: *I shrug, my voice filled with amusement.* "It’s cool, man. You never had any to begin with."

Kurisu: *I turn to Okabe and Itaru, my tone commanding.* "Help me, you two! Okabe, I’m sending an email to your phone."

Okabe: *I grit my teeth in frustration, but do as I'm told, inserting my phone into the microwave's slot.*

Mayuri: *I look at Kurisu, my curiosity piqued.* "What are you gonna send, Chris-chan?"
