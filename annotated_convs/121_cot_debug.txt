Planning: 

The characters involved are Okabe, Mayuri, Kurisu, and Itaru. Okabe is eccentric and a self-proclaimed mad scientist; Mayuri is a sweet, simple-minded girl with a cheerful personality; Kurisu is a logical, serious, and brilliant scientist with a hidden playful side; and Itaru is a hardcore otaku and hacker, who often adds light humor to the scenes. 

In the scene, they are experimenting with the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and experiencing a strange phenomenon with the mails they send. This is an exciting and tense moment, as they are on the brink of a significant scientific discovery. 

1. Okabe's actions will involve dramatic movements and expressions, reflecting his eccentric personality. His thoughts will be analytical and a bit over-the-top.
2. Mayuri's actions will be gentler and more timid, reflecting her sweet nature. Her thoughts will be simple and straightforward.
3. Kurisu's actions will be more controlled and professional, reflecting her logical and serious nature. However, her playful side will also come out in this scene. Her thoughts will be analytical and objective.
4. Itaru's actions will be casual and relaxed, reflecting his otaku personality. His thoughts will be straightforward and slightly humorous.

The anchor lines will be Okabe's "MUHAHAHAHA! It’s working! It’s working, you guys!" and Kurisu's "...Did it arrive?". These lines will be reworked to emphasize the excitement and tension in the scene.

Roleplay:

Mayuri: *I tilt my head in confusion, my brows furrowed as I try to make sense of the English words on the screen.* "Hmm? Lemme see... Okabe is an airhe...?"

Okabe: *I snap my attention towards Kurisu, my eyes wide with suspicion.* "Wait! You there, assistant! What are you typing?"

Kurisu: *I smirk at Okabe, my finger hovering over the send button on my phone.* "You’ll see. Ready? I’m sending it."

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest as I watch Daru set the microwave’s timer. The room is filled with an intense energy as we prepare for the experiment. I reach out and grasp the microwave’s door handle, my palms sweaty with anticipation. Mayuri seeks cover, her eyes wide with fear and excitement.*

Itaru: *I grin at the team, my fingers dancing over the keyboard.* "Starting the countdown!"

Okabe: *I feel my heart skip a beat as the microwave timer drops to 70. The tension in the room is palpable.*

Itaru: *I count down the final seconds, my voice steady despite the excitement.* "3, 2, 1... zero."

Okabe: *The moment Kurisu hits send, I yank open the microwave door. The room is filled with a blinding light and a loud crackle of electricity.*

Kurisu: *I squeal in surprise, my eyes wide with shock and awe.* "Kya!"

Okabe: *I throw my head back and laugh maniacally, my heart pounding with adrenaline and excitement.* "MUHAHAHAHA! It’s working! It’s working, you guys!"

Okabe: *The cushion underneath the PhoneWave (name subject to change) collapses under the weight, and the floor starts creaking. The room is filled with the smell of ozone, and my hair stands on end from the static electricity in the air.*

Kurisu: *I step forward, my eyes locked on the PhoneWave (name subject to change). My heart pounds in my chest as I ask the million-dollar question.* "...Did it arrive?"

Okabe: *I disconnect my phone from the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and check my mail. My heart skips a beat as I see two emails, both written in English and timestamped from five days ago.*

Kurisu: *I can't help but laugh when I see the mail, despite the tension in the room.* "Pfft..."

Okabe: *I turn to Kurisu, my eyes narrowed in suspicion.* "Christina. Did you send two mails?"

Kurisu: *I look at Okabe in confusion, my brows furrowed.* "Eh? No. I only sent one."

Mayuri: *I nod in agreement, my eyes wide and innocent.* "Mayushii saw it too. She really only sent one."

Okabe: *I feel a sense of triumph as I hold up my phone.* "But I received two."

Kurisu: *I lean in to look at Okabe's phone, my eyes widening in surprise.* "You’re right... I even sent it in one sentence, but it got divided."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow at Kurisu, a smirk playing on my lips.* "By the way, what does this word mean?"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, a teasing smile on my lips.* "Why don’t you look it up?"

Okabe: *I glance at Itaru, a question in my eyes.* "That reminds me. The D-Mail from before was cut up mid-sentence too."

Itaru: *I nod in agreement, my fingers tapping on the keyboard.* "Yeah. Look at your history. I’m pretty sure I sent ’Okarin’s a perv’."

Okabe: *I scroll through my mail history, my heart pounding in my chest.* "You’re right. This one got split too."

Kurisu: *I frown in concentration, my mind racing to figure out the cause.* "I wonder what’s causing it."

Okabe: *I look at Kurisu, a mischievous glint in my eyes.* "Maybe it’s related to the jellymen."

Mayuri: *I raise my hand timidly, my voice soft and unsure.* "Um, Mayushii wants to know why it arrived five days ago."
