Okabe: *With a triumphant grin, I slam my fist on the table.* "Yeah. It did."

Itaru: *Leaning back in my chair, I scratch my head.* "Is there some kind of rule for when it arrives?"

Mayuri: *Clapping my hands together in excitement, I bounce on my heels.* "Let's try sending more!"

Okabe: *Feeling a surge of anticipation, I nod in agreement.* "Mayuri's right. Now that we’ve figured out how to send D-Mails, we should keep experimenting and collect as much data as we can." *With a dramatic sweep of my hand, I point towards the equipment.* "Alright, lab mems! Battle stations!"

Kurisu: *Rolling my eyes at Okabe's antics, I cross my arms over my chest.* "He’s at it again..."

Okabe: *Striking a pose, I project my voice like a commander addressing his troops.* "Our mission: to send as many D-Mails as possible! Daru, man the X68000. Your job is to observe, adjust, and gather information on the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Assistant, keep those mails coming! Try various patterns of text. Japanese, English, full-width, half-width, emoticons. The actual messages don’t matter." *I glance at Kurisu, a smirk pulling at my lips.* "I’m sure Shining Finger would be better for the job, but since she’s not a lab mem, I’ll leave it to you."

Mayuri: *Tilting my head to the side, I ask,* "What about Mayushii?"

Okabe: *I turn to her, my eyes gleaming with a mischievous glint.* "Your mission is to go shopping. Just buy some bananas for now. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall fund you!"

Mayuri: *Clapping my hands together, I giggle.* "Wow! You’re so generous♪"

Kurisu: *Raising an eyebrow, I tease,* "So I guess your job is opening the microwave."

Itaru: *Chuckling, I give Okabe a teasing grin.* "Whoa! You saved the easiest job for yourself?"

Okabe: *I scoff, waving a dismissive hand.* "Heh. No, my assistant’s judgment is sound. The key to a successful D-Mail is most likely the correct timing of opening the microwave door!"

Kurisu: *I blink, surprised, then shrug.* "Uh, I was just kidding."

Okabe: *Laughing maniacally, I raise my hands in the air.* "MUHAHAHAHA! Leave this task to Hououin Kyouma! I shall open this door with precision, boldness, and delicacy, as if it were the flesh of a beautiful woman!"

Mayuri: *Blushing, I wag my finger at him.* "Okarin, that’s naughty!"

Okabe: *With a stern look, I point at each member of the team.* "Furthermore, the current operation is top secret. You must not leak it to anyone. Got it?" *I note Mayuri's nod, though the others seem to be ignoring me.*

Okabe: *Puffing out my chest, I prepare to make a grand announcement.* "Now I shall give this operation a name! It shall be known as Op--"

Kurisu: *Interrupting him, I wave my hand dismissively.* "Don’t need one. Let’s start."

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback.* "Wha... but..." *My shoulders slump in disappointment.* "You ruined my climactic scene! Damn you, assistant! This is an outrage!" *Despite this setback, we continue with the D-Mail experiment -- its name is Operation Urd, though I lost my chance to announce it -- for two hours. During that time, every D-Mail goes back in time without a hitch. Now it’s time to take a break. We’re all hungry, and except for Mayuri, we’ve been up since last night.*

Kurisu: *Looking up from the equipment, I push my glasses up the bridge of my nose.* "Go ahead and rest. I’m gonna have a go at it a little longer."
