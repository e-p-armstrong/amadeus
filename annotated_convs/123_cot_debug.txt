Planning stage:
The characters involved in this scene are Suzuha, Okabe, and Itaru. 
- Suzuha is a strong, independent, and somewhat mysterious woman. She speaks in a straightforward manner and often uses unusual words. Her actions should reflect her firmness and determination, and her dialogue might be enhanced with descriptions of her decisive movements and piercing gaze.
- Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, who often acts in a flamboyant and exaggerated way to keep up his persona. His actions should be expressive and dramatic, and his thoughts filled with curiosity and intrigue. 
- Itaru, also known as Daru, is a laid-back and soft-spoken character. He often offers practical perspectives and his actions should display his easygoing nature and his loyalty to Okabe.

I'll anchor on Suzuha's line: "She’s... my enemy." and Okabe's line: "I have come!". The first line is the crux of the mystery surrounding Suzuha's hostility towards Kurisu, and the second one is a reflection of Okabe's dramatic flair. 

Roleplay:
Suzuha: *I continue my exercises, not missing a beat as I spot him approaching.* "What shenanigans are you up to this early in the morning?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, intrigued by her choice of words.* "The kind you wouldn’t believe. We’re building the first time machine in human history."

Suzuha: *I pause momentarily, a slight smirk playing on my lips before resuming my workout.* "Huh. Cool."

Okabe: "Hey, shouldn’t you be more surprised!?" *I wave my arms dramatically, feigning offense at her nonchalance.*

Itaru: "Can’t blame her for being skeptical. I didn’t think it was possible either. And isn’t that top secret? I thought you didn’t want anyone to know." *I say, scratching the back of my head, a bit uneasy.*

Okabe: "Crap! Part-Time Warrior, please keep what I just said a secret." *I plead, looking at her with wide eyes, realizing my error.*

Suzuha: "Sure. By the way..." *I glance towards the Braun Tube Workshop, my tone turning serious.* "The boss is really pissed."

Okabe: "Why?" *I ask, my curiosity piqued again.*

Suzuha: "The noise. Whatever you’re doing up there, it’s got the whole building shaking. Dust everywhere. Kinda like an air raid. He was saying stuff like ’What’s that nutcase doing? I’mma raise his damn rent!’ Maybe you should go apologize." *I explain, a hint of concern in my voice.*

Itaru: "Oh boy. What if he kicks us out?" *I mutter, an anxious expression crossing my face.*

Okabe: "Alright, leave it to me. Daru, go tell my assistant to lay off the experiments for now." *I command, trying to sound confident.*

Itaru: "Roger that... I won’t forget you, soldier." *I salute him before scurrying off to the second floor.*

Suzuha: "...By the way, is Makise Kurisu here too?" *I ask, my voice barely above a whisper.*

Okabe: "Yeah." *I nod, recalling the argument from yesterday.* "Have you met before?"

Suzuha: "Um... no. Yesterday was first contact." *I answer, averting my gaze.*

Okabe: "First contact?" *I repeat, puzzled by her choice of words.* "Oh. Really? Weren’t you a little hostile for a first contact?"

Suzuha: *I swallow hard, my voice barely audible.* "She’s... my enemy."

Okabe: "How can she be your enemy? You just met, right?" *I ask, taken aback by her revelation.*

Suzuha: "Yeah." *I reply curtly, my expression hardening.*

Okabe: "Did she do something to you?" *I probe further, trying to understand the situation.*

Suzuha: "Not to me." *I respond, my voice barely above a whisper.*

Okabe: "What does that mean? She did something to someone else? If you want, I can go talk things over with Christina." *I offer, hoping to defuse the tension.*

Suzuha: "It doesn’t really matter." *I dismiss, avoiding his gaze.*

Okabe: "Maybe you’re blaming the wrong person?" *I suggest, trying to reason with her.*

Suzuha: "Geez! Give it a rest!" *I snap, shooting him a glare.* "Anyway! Shouldn’t you apologize to the boss instead of talking to me?"

Okabe: *I gulp down my fear, steeling myself for the confrontation.* "I have come!" *I declare, stepping into the Braun Tube Workshop, my chest puffed out in a display of false bravado.*
