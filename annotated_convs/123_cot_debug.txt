Kurisu: "...I suppose." *She looks at the others, her gaze thoughtful yet uncertain.*

Okabe: "One hour later, we arrive once again at the present. At that time, the me who lost his memories an hour ago and the current me conflict in my brain. Which data set survives?" *I question, my brows furrowed in deep concentration.*

Kurisu: "...Logically, the present should change as soon as you send your memories to the past." *She crosses her arms, tapping her fingers as she thinks aloud.*

Okabe: *I tilt my head, trying to comprehend her words.* "So then it's not a copy-paste at all, is it?"

Kurisu: "I don't know. No one's ever experienced time travel before." *She admits, her voice filled with a mix of frustration and curiosity.*

Okabe: "When we send a D-Mail, the world is reconstructed based on the change we made to the past." *I explain,* "I'm the only one who's aware of this, however."

Kurisu: "We don't know what happens when you time leap. If it's the many-worlds interpretation like Titor said, then the instant you time leap, it creates two possibilities -- one where you shift to another worldline, and one where you travel back in time on the same worldline. Of course, there must also be a worldline where the current you doesn't disappear. That would likely correspond to the present that we are experiencing right now." *She waves her hands as she speaks, trying to illustrate her point.*

Mayuri: "???" *Mayuri looks between us, clearly lost in the flood of technical jargon.*

Okabe: "I thought you didn't believe what Titor had to say." *I challenge her.*

Kurisu: "I'm talking hypothetically. Titor doesn't matter right now. If it's the Copenhagen interpretation, then every possible state propagates through space as a wave function. When a particular state is observed, the remaining states collapse and that state is fixed." *She argues, her eyes sparkling with determination.*

Okabe: "The problem is who the observer is in this case." *I ponder aloud.*

Itaru: "Wouldn't it be a third party? Like me, or Mayu-shi." *Itaru suggests, pointing at himself and Mayuri.*

Mayuri: "...?" *She blinks, even more confused than before.*

Okabe: "Not necessarily. It might be me. It might be someone else. It could even be God." *I muse, my gaze distant as I contemplate the possibilities.*

Okabe: "In the end, we arrive at the question of 'where is the self?'" *I conclude, my expression serious.*

Kurisu: "This Time Leap Machine only sends memories. That, I guarantee." *She states firmly, her gaze steady on me.*

Itaru: "Won't the present be reconstructed at the moment of transfer? That's what happens with Okarin's Reading Steiner, right?" *Itaru questions, looking at me for confirmation.*

Okabe: "That makes sense where D-Mails are concerned. When we send a D-Mail, we're obviously interfering in past events. But time leaping is different. All you do is send your memories to the past, which isn't the same thing as sending a targeted D-Mail. Whether the me who suddenly 'remembers' one hour into the future will, in fact, change the past is something we can't know until it happens." *I explain, my hands moving animatedly with my words.*

Itaru: "I'm getting confused. It sounds like we're talking about the soul. Isn't that a religious question?" *Itaru scratches his head, looking bemused.*

Kurisu: "Wait. You guys are misunderstanding something. One hour isn't enough time for your personality to change. You should be the same person one hour ago that you are now. The only difference is that you'll have an extra hour's worth of memories." *She interrupts, her voice firm and clear.*

Okabe: "How can you be sure?" *I challenge, my eyes narrowed in suspicion.*

Kurisu: "...Well, I can't. Nobody's tried it before." *She admits reluctantly.*

Mayuri: "So, which is it?" *Mayuri asks, her voice tentative.*

Kurisu: "We don't know. We can argue the theories all we want, but in the end, we can only guess. This experiment may end up shattering preconceptions scientists and philosophers have held for centuries." *She ends on a powerful note, her eyes sparkling with excitement and trepidation.*
