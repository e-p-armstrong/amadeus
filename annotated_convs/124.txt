Okabe: *I look around, my heart pounding as the building starts to shake again. Flakes of concrete start falling from the ceiling, adding to the chaos.* "Dammit, Daru! What are you doing!? I thought I told you to stop the experiments!"

Tennouji: *He turns to me, his eyes blazing with fury.* "Okabe!" *I can feel his anger radiating off of him like a wave of heat.*

Tennouji: *He stabs a finger at the ceiling, causing flakes of concrete to fall into his ramen.* "The ceiling is falling, you dumbass! Some got into my ramen! What are you gonna do about it, huh!? No more shaking! Or I’ll raise your rent by 10, 000!"

Okabe: *I can feel my heart drop into my stomach.* "Leave it to me, Mister Braun! On my honor, I swear there won’t be any more shaking today!" *With a quick salute, I race out of the Braun Tube Workshop.*

Okabe: *I burst into the lab, out of breath and desperate.* "Christina! Stop the experiments at once!"

Mayuri: *She looks up from her Juicy Chicken Number One, her eyes wide and innocent.* "Sorry, Okarin. Mayushii tried to warm up some chicken. I accidentally put it through reverse rotation, and then it started sparking."

Okabe: *I sigh in defeat, my shoulders slumping.* "...I see."

Kurisu: *She glances at me, her fork poised over her cup noodles.* "I sent you an email. Didn’t you get it?"

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, the frustration bubbling up inside me.* "Stop screwing around! I’m the one who has to deal with Mister Braun!"

Kurisu: *She raises an eyebrow, her expression calm and composed.* "But I gave you five days advance notice."

Itaru: *He looks up from his boxed lunch, his eyes filled with concern.* "Was he mad?"

Okabe: *I shudder, the memory of Tennouji's Killing Aura still fresh in my mind.* "Yeah... I could feel his Killing Aura."

Okabe: *I glance around the room, my gaze landing on the two girls who don't seem to understand the gravity of the situation.* "Anyway, no more experiments today."

Kurisu: *She stretches, her fingers brushing against the ceiling as she yawns.* "Well, at least we got some good data." *Her voice is filled with exhaustion.* "I’m dead tired, and my hair’s dried out. I want to take a shower and go sleep."

Okabe: *I sigh and take a boxed lunch out of the convenience store bag. It’s cold, so I toss it into the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and set the timer normally.*

Mayuri: *She claps her hands together, her eyes wide and bright with anticipation.* "If you want a shower, there’s one here. It doesn’t have a bath, though. Okarin always uses it."

Kurisu: *She wrinkles her nose, her gaze flicking to the bathroom door.* "It’s probably filthy..."

Okabe: *I shrug, a small smirk playing on my lips.* "I’d be lying if I called it clean. This entire building is in shambles."

Kurisu: *She crosses her arms, a determined expression on her face.* "Anyway, I refuse to use the same shower as Okabe."

Okabe: *I chuckle, my heart feeling lighter despite the situation.* "I understand. Nobody will blame you if you don’t use it. Of course, since the three of us stayed up all night, we’re all pretty smelly. Heh heh heh."
