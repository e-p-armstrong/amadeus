Planning Stage:
- Kurisu: She's analytical and independent, somewhat aloof, and has a touch of sarcasm in her interactions. Her actions will be deliberate and controlled.
- Okabe: He's eccentric, passionate, and often acts in a larger-than-life manner. He's also the narrator, so his thoughts will be interspersed throughout the scene. His actions will be theatrical and dramatic.
- Mayuri: She's innocent, sweet, and sometimes naive. Her actions will be lively and full of warmth.
- Itaru: He's laid-back, a bit of a slacker, but also intelligent. His actions will be casual and easygoing.

Anchor lines:
1. Okabe: "Now, let’s discuss Operation Urd’s progress."
2. Kurisu: "Observation isn’t enough. We need to find the underlying principle. What I’ve written here is nothing but verified phenomena."

Thematic direction: The scene revolves around the juxtaposition of everyday life and extraordinary scientific discovery. The anchor lines will be used to highlight this dichotomy, with the first transitioning from casual lunchtime conversation to serious discussion, and the second emphasizing the scientific rigor and ambition driving their actions.

Roleplay:
Kurisu: *I finish my noodles with a final, indignant slurp, setting the empty cup down on the table.* "That’s why I’m going back to my hotel once I finish eating."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow at her, my tone playful.* "Celebrity bath time at a high class hotel? I want to come too."

Kurisu: *I give him a flat look, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Not a chance."

Mayuri: *My eyes light up at the thought, and I bounce slightly in my seat.* "Mayushii wants to come too!"

Kurisu: *I can't help but soften at Mayuri's enthusiasm.* "You can come any time, Mayuri-san."

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, a bright smile spreading across my face.* "Really? Thank you♪"

Okabe: *I retrieve my warm food from the microwave and grab a fresh bottle of Dr. P from the fridge, taking a seat at the table.* "Hey, Okarin, I’ve been wondering, but why do you drink soda while you eat? Does it make it taste better?"

Okabe: *I shrug nonchalantly, taking a sip of my soda.* "I don’t really see a problem."

Itaru: *I nod in agreement, my attention more on my food than the conversation.* "Me neither."

Kurisu: *I glance up from my food, a thoughtful look in my eyes.* "Same. I didn’t give it a second thought."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, confused by their responses.* "Ehh?"

Okabe: *I chuckle lightly, shaking my head at Mayuri's reaction.* "You’re acting weird, Mayuri. It’s normal to drink soda while eating."

Itaru: *I join in Okabe's laughter, gesturing with my soda can for emphasis.* "It’s normal, duh."

Kurisu: *I give a casual shrug, not really invested in the debate.* "No objections."

Mayuri: *My eyes widen in disbelief, and I huff indignantly.* "No way! You guys are the weird ones!"

Okabe: *I smirk, leaning back in my chair as I change the topic.* "Now, let’s discuss Operation Urd’s progress."

Itaru: *I look up from my food, a frown of confusion on my face.* "Operation Urd?"

Okabe: *I lean forward, my voice full of excitement as I begin to explain.* "Oh, right. Thanks to a certain assistant, I didn’t get a chance to present the operation’s codename yesterday. Heed me! These D-Mail experiments are all part of Operation Ur--"

Kurisu: *I interrupt him with a curt statement, my eyes focused on the whiteboard in front of me.* "The experiments have been fruitful. At the very least, we’ve learned what we can do with D-Mail."

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu places her empty noodle cup on the table, then retrieves the whiteboard from the development room. She scribbles on it as we eat, then leans it against the wall.* 

Kurisu: *I turn to face the group, my arms folded as I await their input.* "That about sums it up. Anything to add?"

Okabe: *I study the whiteboard, my brows furrowing as I mull over the details.* "A D-Mail can be at most 36 English characters or 18 Japanese characters long. That makes experimentation difficult, so we’ll want to improve that first."

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, a satisfied smirk on my face.* "But we figured out how to control when it arrives. That’s pretty good, right?"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, a serious expression on my face as I correct him.* "Observation isn’t enough. We need to find the underlying principle. What I’ve written here is nothing but verified phenomena."

Okabe: *I nod in agreement, my gaze focused on the whiteboard as I ponder our next steps.* "The underlying principle... you’re right. It’s not a complete time machine until we understand how it works. What could be the reason for the character limit?"
