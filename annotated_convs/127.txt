Okabe: *A feeling of unease washes over me as I read the news subtitle.* "Terrorist bomb threat suspends Yamanote, Sobu, Keihin-Tohoku lines."

Suzuha: "A bomb threat?" *She echoes my thoughts aloud, her eyes fixed on the TV screen.*

Itaru: "Hang on. Those lines all pass through Akiba." *He turns to Mayuri, worry creasing his forehead.* "How is Mayu-shi gonna get home?"

Mayuri: "Oh yeah. I should call home." *She starts fumbling for her phone, her hands shaking slightly.*

Okabe: *I sit quietly, trying to piece everything together. A bomb threat in Akihabara... it doesn't feel like a coincidence.*

Suzuha: *Suddenly, Suzuha's voice pulls me out of my thoughts.* "Okabe Rintaro. I need to know. You've completed the Time Leap Machine, right?"

Okabe: "Huh? Well, yeah..." *I respond, slightly taken aback by her sudden question.*

Suzuha: "Okay. I just remembered I've got something to do. I'm going out." *With that, she swiftly exits the lab, leaving us all in a state of confusion.*

Kurisu: "What's wrong with her?" *Kurisu asks, her eyes following Suzuha's retreating figure.*

Okabe: *As I ponder on the situation, various thoughts and images flash through my mind. The threatening emails, SERN, the Z Program, the Time Leap Machine... it all seems to be connected somehow.*

Kurisu: "We may have created a monster here..." *Kurisu's voice drifts through the room, adding to the air of unease.*
