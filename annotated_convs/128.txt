Moeka: *She shakes her head slowly, her gaze never leaving my face.* "You don't need to know. You can't resist. Come with us."

Okabe: "W-where?" *I stammer, feeling a cold sweat break out on my forehead.*

Moeka: *She remains silent, her lips pressed into a firm line. The silent refusal of my question sends a wave of fear through me.* 

Okabe: *I gulp, trying to summon my courage.* "I'm n-not going anywhere until you answer." 

Moeka: "You can't refuse. You have nowhere to run. We have men stationed throughout Akihabara." *Her voice is cold and unyielding, sending a shiver down my spine.*

Okabe: *A realization hits me. It was them. They were behind everything.* 

Moeka: "I don't want to hurt anyone. The three of you, come with us." *She insists, her tone softening just a fraction.*

Moeka: *She turns to face Kurisu, her expression unreadable.*

Kurisu: *She swallows nervously before speaking up.* "Why just the three of us?"
