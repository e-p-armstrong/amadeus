Okabe: *I step onto the couch, one foot raised high for emphasis, and turn to look at each lab member in turn. My eyes shine with a fervor that only I can truly understand.* "You must take off your shoes. It's dirty!"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, frowning slightly as I point to Okabe's feet.* "You have to take off your shoes. It’s dirty!"

Okabe: *Ignoring Mayuri's complaint, I press on, my voice echoing in the small room.* "Today -- uhh, what day is it?"

Itaru: *I glance at my computer screen, checking the date.* "August 2nd."

Okabe: *A wide grin spreads across my face as I raise my hands high, as if to embrace the cosmos.* "August 2nd, 2010 is a date which will live in infamy! For on this day, we, the Future Gadget Laboratory, have developed-- The first successful time machine in the history of mankind!"

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, crossing my arms over my chest.* "It’s not the first. SERN beat us."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, my arms folded as I challenge Okabe's claim.* "And you can’t even say we developed it. It happened by accident."

Okabe: *I scoff, waving a dismissive hand at Kurisu's comment.* "Hmph! It seems that my assistant doesn’t know the meaning of the word ’serendipity’. Penicillin, X-ray machines, dynamite -- these inventions and more were all born from coincidence!"

Kurisu: *I sigh, rubbing my forehead as I concede.* "I guess..."

Mayuri: *I blink, looking from Kurisu to Okabe, my brows furrowed in confusion.* "But Chris-chan, you said before that time machines don’t exist, right? But now you admit they do!"

Kurisu: *I glance at Mayuri, my expression softening.* "It’s just that I have to admit it for now. If we investigate how the PhoneWave works, it might turn out to be something that only seems like time travel."

Okabe: *I throw up my hands, my voice filled with mock outrage.* "Does nobody have any respect for my grand declaration!? Don’t complain if I take all the credit for inventing the first -- second, whatever -- time machine in human history! The 66th Round Table Conference ends here. Dismissed!"

Itaru: *I blink, taken aback by Okabe's sudden ending.* "Wait, that was a Round Table Conference? I didn’t know that. And it’s even the 66th."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, clearly unimpressed by Okabe's theatrics.* "Who cares what kind of table it is?"

Kurisu: *I rise from my chair, stretching my arms high above my head, the tension of the day finally starting to ebb away.* "I’m gonna go back to my hotel, take a shower, and sleep."

Mayuri: *I glance at the clock, a soft sigh escaping my lips.* "Mayushii has to go to work soon."
