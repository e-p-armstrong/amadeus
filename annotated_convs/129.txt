*Moeka slowly raises her gun, the barrel aimed at an unsuspecting Mayuri, her expression void of emotions.*

Moeka: "Shiina Mayuri is not needed."

Okabe: "Stop!" *I lunge towards Moeka, desperation clear in my voice.*

*However, before I can reach her, a dark-skinned man intercepts me, delivering a crushing blow to my chin.*

Okabe: "Gah!" *I crumble to the ground, the world spinning around me.*

Mayuri: "Okarin!" *Her voice is frantic as she reaches out to me, her hand trembling.*

*I struggle to get up, my vision blurry. The sight of Moeka, her gun still pointed at Mayuri, fills me with dread.*

Kurisu: "Mayuri! No!" *She screams, her eyes wide with terror.*

*My voice is trapped in my throat, only a pitiful wheeze escaping as I watch the scene unfold before me.*

Moeka: "For SERN... for FB... for SERN... for FB..." *She repeats monotonously, her finger slowly squeezing the trigger.*

*A gunshot echoes through the room, and Mayuri collapses into my arms, her life bleeding away.*

Itaru: "Wahhhhhhhhhhh!" *Daru screams, clutching his head in disbelief.*

Mayuri: "O...kari..." *Her voice is barely a whisper as she breathes her last.*

Okabe: "...Mayuri?" *I shake her lifeless body, unable to comprehend the reality of what just happened.*

Kurisu: "No... no!" *She cries out, her voice filled with despair.*

Moeka: "You three come with us. Now. No more warnings. Resist, and we'll kill you too." *Her voice is cold and emotionless, the threat clear.*

*Still cradling Mayuri's lifeless body, I stand and face Moeka, my mind filled with rage.*

Okabe: "Ah... AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" *I roar, my grief transforming into blind fury.*

*Just as I'm about to charge at Moeka, Kurisu grabs my arm.*

Kurisu: "Okabe!" *Her voice is pleading, her grip tight.*

Okabe: "Let me go! Let me go!" *I struggle against her hold, my eyes never leaving Moeka's.*

Kurisu: "You can't! They'll kill you!" *She pleads, her eyes filled with fear.*

*Ignoring her pleas, I turn to face Moeka, my voice shaking with anger.*

Okabe: "You gonna kill me too!?" 

Moeka: "If you resist." *She says calmly, her finger already on the trigger.*

Kurisu: "Please, Okabe, do what she says. Okay? Otherwise, they'll kill you too." *She begs, her voice barely a whisper.*
