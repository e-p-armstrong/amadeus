Okabe: *I stand tall, my hands clasped behind my back, my voice steady and resolute.* "I can’t tell you. I swore a blood oath to maintain secrecy and protect the original owner from those who desire the IBN 5100." *I glance at Moeka, her head bowed, her fingers twitching at her sides.*

Okabe: *I narrow my eyes, my mind racing with potential scenarios.* "I mean, anything could happen. Moeka might seduce Luka’s dad, for instance, and get him to lend her the IBN 5100." *I shudder at the thought.* "And then I couldn’t complain if Moeka took it away. I must avoid that situation at all costs." *I glance at Moeka, her gaze fixed on the floor, her hands wringing her phone.*

Okabe: *I soften, my tone more understanding.* "...I am not without sympathy for your plight. I formed a contract with the IBN 5100 for my own goals. After I achieve those goals, you can negotiate with the original owner to form a contract of your own." *I take a deep breath, steeling myself for the battle ahead.* "When I return the IBN 5100 to Yanabayashi Shrine, Ragnarok will be over, and the fate of the world will have already been decided."

Okabe: *I take a step back, my heart heavy in my chest.* "And when Ragnarok is over, whether it ends in victory or defeat, my life as Hououin Kyouma will be... No, forget what I said. This is no time to be thinking about the future. After all, my future is already..."

Moeka: *I look up, my eyes wide, my voice barely a whisper.* "Anyway... where was it?"

Okabe: *I sigh, rolling my eyes.* "Geez, I had some good angst going there. She’s just oblivious to the mood." *I shake my head, a wry smile on my lips.* "The IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine."

Okabe: *I look up as the door opens. I watch as Daru enters, wiping the sweat from his brow.* "You sure are early."

Itaru: *I drop my towel on the table, a lazy grin on my face.* "I went to bed early. Woke up at five this morning. Man, it’s hot! It’s not supposed to be this hot in the morning. Oh? Oh? Okarin, who’s this erot... sexy 3D woman?"

Okabe: *I gesture towards Moeka, a smirk on my face.* "Ah, let me introduce you. This is Shining Finger, Kiryu Moeka."

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, my interest piqued.* "Shining... Finger? Does her hand glow with an awesome power?"

Okabe: *I laugh, shaking my head.* "No, but she’s definitely an esper."

Itaru: *I snort, crossing my arms over my chest.* "An esper? That’s stupid."

Okabe: *I shrug, my grin never fading.* "Watch her type. You’ll see."

Itaru: *I look over at Moeka, my curiosity growing.* "Well, whatever. Welcome to the lab, Kiryu-shi."

Okabe: *I watch as Daru greets Moeka, a hint of amusement in my eyes.* "Even though Daru bowed his head, Moeka doesn’t so much as look at him. She’s now looking down at her phone -- not that she ever really looked away. Daru turns red."

Itaru: *I stutter, my cheeks flushed.* "Wh-what magnificent ignore skill. Are you looking down on me because I’m a fatass ota? You’re a mainstream woman, aren’t you!?"
