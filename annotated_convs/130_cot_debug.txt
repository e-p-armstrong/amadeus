Plan:
1. Characters involved and their archetypes/personalities:
   - Okabe: The eccentric, self-proclaimed mad scientist who is often theatrical and dramatic in his actions. He's observant and can be serious when the situation calls for it.
   - Itaru: Okabe's reliable and loyal friend, who is usually laid-back and often incorporates humor into his conversations, often related to his otaku interests.
   - Moeka: A quiet, socially awkward woman who communicates primarily through text messages, even when face-to-face with someone. She often appears detached and unresponsive.
2. Key lines for dramatic enhancement:
   - Okabe: "If you want to say something, then say it to my--" 
   - Moeka: "Sending email to the past."
3. Thematic direction: The scene is a mix of casual banter and serious discussion, transitioning into a tense and dramatic moment. The focus is on the characters' interactions, their reactions to each other's words, and the sudden shift in atmosphere when Moeka speaks up.

Roleplay:
Itaru: *I scratch my head, my gaze shifting between Okabe and the impassive Moeka, who seems to be completely unresponsive to my attempts at conversation.* "Hey, Okabe. Did you... do something to her?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, genuinely puzzled.* "Like what? We were just taking pictures."

Itaru: *A mischievous grin spreads across my face as I imagine the worst.* "Pictures... pictures? So you’re going to blackmail her and force her to be our sex toy..."

Okabe: *I sigh, exasperated.* "Stop applying eroge logic to reality."

Itaru: *I chuckle, raising my hands in a mock surrender.* "My bad."

Itaru: *I glance towards the PhoneWave, a thoughtful expression on my face.* "Oh, right. I thought up some upgrades we could make to the PhoneWave."

Okabe: "Like what?"

Itaru: "You know how it’s a huge pain in the ass to send D-Mails to the past?"

Okabe: *I nod, recalling the tedious process.* "Yeah."

Itaru: "I want to simplify that process. Oh, and also make it possible to forward from the PhoneWave’s dedicated phone."

Okabe: *I frown, trying to grasp his meaning.* "Forward? What do you mean?"

Itaru: "Right now, you can only send a D-Mail to the phone attached to the PhoneWave, right?"

Okabe: *I nod, remembering the flood of D-Mails that had filled my inbox during yesterday's experiments.* "That’s pretty inconvenient. If we give the PhoneWave’s dedicated phone a forwarding function, we can use it to send D-Mails to any number we want."

Okabe: "How long will that upgrade take?"

Itaru: "Two or three hours? That’s if you help me, though."

Okabe: *I clench my fist, determination burning in my eyes.* "Understood. I’ll help."

Itaru: *I flash him a thumbs-up, satisfied with his response.* "OK."

Okabe: *I walk up to Itaru, my hand raised for a high five, only to be ignored as he begins eating. I let out a sigh of exasperation, lowering my hand slowly. Just as I'm about to head back to the development room, my phone rings, breaking the silence. I glance at the screen, seeing Moeka's name flash across it. I ignore it, turning back to Itaru.* "If you want to say something, then say it to my--"

Moeka: *My gaze, usually glued to my phone, is now fixed on Okabe. I interrupt him, my voice low and serious.* "...Read the email."

Okabe: *I pause mid-sentence, her unexpected directness catching me off guard.* "Say it to my--"

Moeka: *I cut him off again, my eyes unblinking.* "Sending email to the past."

Okabe: *I gasp, my words dying in my throat. Her words echo in the room, the implications sending a chill down my spine.* "...!"
