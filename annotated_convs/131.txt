Okabe: "Aagh, ahhhh!!" *I clench my teeth, a sharp pain piercing my skull. My body begins to shiver uncontrollably, an unbearable itch spreading through me.*

Okabe: "Ah!" *I stagger back, the world around me reassembling as the pain subsides. I find myself standing in front of the Time Leap Machine, gasping for air.*

Okabe: "Ahhh..." *I close my mouth, drawing in a deep, ragged breath. I can feel a burning sensation in my throat, my body drenched in sweat.*

Okabe: "...ckhaah, haahh, haahh, hah..." *I wipe the sweat off my forehead with the back of my hand, the movement slow and uncoordinated. I blink slowly, trying to shake off the lingering feeling of disconnect.*

Kurisu: "Okabe? Are you listening?" *She calls out, her voice pulling me back to reality.*

Okabe: *I turn to her, her concerned gaze meeting mine.*

Kurisu: "What was all that screaming for?" *She asks, her brows furrowing in confusion.*

Okabe: *I clear my throat, struggling to find my voice.* "...No, I'm fine."

Kurisu: "Then get ready to go already. We're going shopping, remember?" *She reminds me, her voice gentle and patient.*

Okabe: "...Shopping?" *I repeat, the memories of our plans hitting me like a freight train.*

Okabe: "Ah... ah..." *I murmur, the realization sinking in.*

Okabe: "Where am I?" *I ask, my voice shaking.*

Kurisu: "Huh?" *She stares at me, her confusion deepening.*

Okabe: "What time is it now!? What month? What day!?" *I grab her shoulders, pulling her close in desperation.*

Kurisu: "Hey, that hurts! Calm down!" *She winces, trying to pull away from my grip.*
