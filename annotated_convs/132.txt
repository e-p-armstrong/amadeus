Okabe: *I sit quietly in the lab, lost in my thoughts, as Kurisu leaves for shopping. Daru and I wait for Mayuri to return.*

Mayuri: "Tutturu♪ I'm back!" *She bursts into the lab, her innocent smile lighting up the room.*

Okabe: *Suddenly, I am overcome by a sense of deja vu.*

Mayuri: "Okarin, Okarin. I called Feris-chan and Luka-chan, but they said they couldn't come." *She breaks the silence, her voice filled with disappointment.*

Okabe: "Oh. Do they have plans?" *I ask, trying to shake off the strange feeling.*

Mayuri: "Feris-chan has a RaiNet tournament."

Itaru: "Crap, I should've gone to cheer! How careless of me!" *His face falls in disappointment.*

Mayuri: "And Luka-chan seemed embarrassed for some reason."

Kurisu: "Maybe she thinks you'll make her wear a costume again." *She joins in, a teasing smile on her face.*

Okabe: "You still haven't convinced her to cosplay?" *I ask, leaning back in my chair.*

Mayuri: "She said it was embarrassing. I keep telling her 'Cuteness is Justice', but she never listens..." *She pouts slightly.*

Kurisu: "'Cuteness is Justice'... is that what they say?" *She raises an eyebrow, looking intrigued.*

Mayuri: "You're cute too, Chris-chan!" *She beams at Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "Hah? Eh?" *She blushes, taken aback by the compliment.*

Mayuri: "Hey, ComiMa's coming up. Wanna go? I can't make something new, but I have a costume of Post-Awakening Seira from Blood Tune I made last year. I think the size is just right for you too." *She asks excitedly.*

Kurisu: "Me, cosplay? I'm sorta interested. But I refuse to do it in public, though." *She replies, looking thoughtful.*

Mayuri: "You don't have to show anyone, but eventually, you'll want them to see. The cosplay demon compels you! That reminds me. Chris-chan, you're always wearing that cute uniform. What school is it from?" *She asks, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.*

Kurisu: "Oh, this? I attended Ayamein for about two weeks. I modeled this outfit after their uniform." *She answers, looking down at her outfit.*

Mayuri: "Oh! Their uniform is really cute, but you made it even cuter! You might have really good design sense♪ I'll bring the costume tomorrow, okay? Will you try it on then?" *She excitedly claps her hands.*

Kurisu: "Sure." *She agrees, a small smile on her face.*

Itaru: "When's the photo shoot?" *He asks eagerly.*

Kurisu: "Good to know you're still a pervert, Hashida." *She shoots him a glare.*

Itaru: "Come on, it's Blood Tune's Seira! She's got 'panmoro' going on!" *He laughs, not bothered by Kurisu's remark.*

Kurisu: "Panmoro?" *She asks, looking confused.*

Itaru: "It means her panties are completely exposed!" *He explains, grinning widely.*

Kurisu: "N-no way..." *Her face turns a deep shade of red.*

Mayuri: "It's okay♪ You might not know this, but last year, there was a really popular saying. 'They're not panties, so it's not embarrassing!'" *She reassures Kurisu, laughing.*

Kurisu: "Japan is over..." *She mutters, looking exasperated.*

Mayuri: "Wear it, okay? It's a promise!" *She insists, clasping Kurisu's hands.*

Suzuha: "Maybe you shouldn't bother." *She suddenly speaks up, her tone sharp. She scowls at Kurisu, changing the atmosphere in the room.*

Okabe: *I stiffen at Suzuha's words, a cold shiver running down my spine.*

Suzuha: "You're asking for trouble by trusting Makise Kurisu." *She says, her gaze hardening.*

Kurisu: "What's that supposed to mean? I've been meaning to ask. Did I do something to you?" *She turns to face Suzuha, her eyebrows furrowed in confusion.*

Suzuha: "Not to me. But I know everything you have done." *She replies, her voice cold and stern.*

Kurisu: "What do you mean? I've done nothing to be guilty of." *She defends herself, crossing her arms.*

Suzuha: "Perhaps. But I know your true nature." *She retorts, not backing down.*

Kurisu: "Wow, you can see into my heart? That's groundbreaking technology. I'd love to hear how it works." *She says, her tone laced with sarcasm.*

Suzuha: "It's not science. It's... a prediction." *She responds, her gaze never leaving Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "So you're just making it up." *She finally dismisses Suzuha, shaking her head in disbelief.*
