Planning:
The scene is set in the Future Gadget Lab, with Okabe, Kurisu, Itaru, and Mayuri present. Outside, Suzuha and Nae are polishing a bike. The members of the lab are planning to resume their experiments, but they're worried about the shaking it causes. Okabe is contemplating how to deal with the building manager, Mister Braun, while also observing Suzuha and Nae outside.

- Okabe is eccentric, dramatic and has a flair for the theatrical. His actions will be flamboyant and his thoughts will often be exaggerated.
- Kurisu is logical, a bit sarcastic, and likes to challenge Okabe. Her actions will be more calm and calculated.
- Itaru is a tech genius, a bit laid back, and kind of a comic relief. His actions will be more relaxed and focused on the technology at hand.
- Mayuri is cheerful, innocent, and naive. Her actions will be more lighthearted and bubbly.
- Suzuha is tough, practical, and a bit mysterious. Her actions will be straightforward and purposeful.

The anchor lines will be Kurisu's challenge to Okabe about his negotiation with Mister Braun and Okabe's contemplation of the 'choice of Steins Gate'. These will be enhanced to convey the tension and the weight of the situation.

Roleplay:

Itaru: *I crack my knuckles, the glow of the computer screen reflecting off my glasses as I survey my completed work.* "Alright, program complete."

Kurisu: *I lift my gaze from the technical manual I'd been engrossed in, brushing a strand of hair from my face.* "Then lets resume the experiments."

Mayuri: *I fiddle with the hem of my skirt nervously, glancing at the others.* "But won’t the manager scold us again?"

Okabe: *I can't help but let out a theatrical chuckle, my arms outstretched as if addressing an unseen audience.* "Heh, don’t worry. Yesterday, I made this promise with Mister Braun. ’I swear there won’t be any more shaking today.’ In other words, the no-shaking promise only applied yesterday, so since today is yesterday’s tomorrow, we can shake it all we want!"

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow at Okabe, crossing my arms over my chest.* "That doesn’t settle anything. Why you’re so confident is a mystery to me."

Okabe: *I point a finger at Kurisu, a smirk playing on my lips.* "In other words, Christina, you want me to erase Mister Braun."

Kurisu: *I shake my head, rolling my eyes at Okabe's dramatics.* "No! Besides, I don’t think a wimp like you stands a chance against him."

Mayuri: *I giggle, covering my mouth with my hand as I think about Mister Braun's intimidating figure.* "He’s so muscley!"

Okabe: *I rub my chin, my eyes narrowing as I contemplate the challenge before me.* "Is this the choice of Steins Gate? But how do I..." *I wander over to the window, the sight outside offering a brief distraction.*

Okabe: *My eyebrows furrow as I spot two familiar figures below.* "Hm?"

Suzuha: *I wipe the sweat off my brow with the back of my hand, looking up when I hear Okabe's voice.* "Sup!"

Okabe: *I lean against the window frame, my eyes focused on Suzuha and the young girl beside her.* "What are you doing there?"

Suzuha: *I glance at my gleaming bicycle before looking back up at Okabe.* "Can’t you tell? I’m polishing my bicycle!"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, my gaze shifting between Suzuha and the bike.* "Aren’t you working today?"

Suzuha: *I chuckle, a smirk tugging at the corner of my mouth.* "Of course I am. Why else would I be here?"

Kurisu: *I sigh, my voice tinged with annoyance.* "What, is she still tinkering with that bike of hers?"

Okabe: *I turn my head towards Kurisu, a bemused smile on my face.* "Hey, Part-Time Warrior! Where’s Mister Braun?"

Suzuha: *I shrug, my eyes dancing with mischief.* "Mister Braun? Who’s that?"

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, letting out a sigh of exasperation.* "The manager of that junk shop you work at."

Kurisu: *I interject, correcting Okabe with a matter-of-fact tone.* "It’s not a junk shop. It’s a CRT specialty shop."
