Suzuha: *I can't help but chuckle, my arms crossed over my chest.* "The boss is on a service trip! I don’t think he’ll be back for a while!"

Okabe: *I gasp, feeling a sudden surge of hope.* "Wh-what!? Is that true!?"

Suzuha: *Grinning, I give a nonchalant shrug.* "It’s true! I wouldn’t be slacking off like this otherwise! Ah, Nae, don’t tell the boss I said that, okay?"

Nae: *I nod seriously.* "Then let me ride your bicycle."

Okabe: *With a sense of dramatic flair, I turn my attention back to the lab.* "You heard her. This must be the choice of Steins Gate. Mister Braun is currently absent. In other words, we can experiment to our heart’s content!"

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, arms folded.* "That doesn’t solve the problem, you know."

Okabe: *I insist, my gaze unwavering.* "I’m telling you, it’s the choice of Steins Gate."

Itaru: *I interject, my fingers twitching over the keyboard.* "Whatever. I want to try out the PhoneWave 2nd Edition v1. 03."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head in confusion.* "Second attention verse erosion?"

Itaru: *I correct her, trying to hide my amusement.* "2nd Edition v1. 03."

Okabe: *I dismiss their banter with a wave of my hand.* "Enough of your unsophisticated names. The upgraded version shall be known as Heavenly Merry-Go-Round."

Kurisu: *I sigh, pinching the bridge of my nose.* "The name doesn’t matter. Let’s just start the experi--"

Moeka: *Without warning, I take out my phone and snap a picture, interrupting the bickering.* "...You looked like you were having fun."

Kurisu: *I turn away, hiding my flushed cheeks.* "Hardly. I’m fed up with these people and their fooling around."

Itaru: *I chuckle, teasing her.* "This assistant is such a tsundere."

Kurisu: *I whirl around, glaring at him.* "Who are you calling a tsundere!?"

Itaru: *I continue to prod, a smirk on my face.* "Oh? Makise-shi, you know what tsundere means?"

Kurisu: *I stutter, caught off guard.* "...N-no."

Okabe: *I can't help but laugh, seeing her flustered.* "I think you do. It’s written all over your face."

Kurisu: *I grumble, turning away again.* "Mmmgh..."

Moeka: *I glance at them, then back at my phone.* "...Experiment please."

Itaru: *I nod, turning my attention back to the computer.* "I’m setting it up so it forwards to Okarin’s phone."
