Planning Stage:

Characters involved:

- Okabe: A self-proclaimed mad scientist, he is dramatic and flamboyant. He often acts with a theatrical flair, and is prone to grandstanding and exaggerated actions. However, underneath it all, he is deeply intelligent and fiercely protective of his friends.

- Kurisu: A brilliant scientist, she is pragmatic, logical, and direct in her approach. She often acts as a voice of reason and is unafraid to challenge Okabe's theories. She's usually reserved, but can be passionate when discussing her field of expertise.

- Itaru: A laid-back and easygoing individual, he often provides comic relief. He tends to be casual and lazy, and is often seen fiddling with his computer.

- Mayuri: Okabe's childhood friend, she is innocent, cheerful, and a bit airheaded. She's often lost in scientific discussions but still tries to participate.

Thematic direction:

The scene revolves around a discussion on the ethics and implications of changing the past. This is a heavy topic, with potential consequences that could be disastrous. The tension between Okabe and Kurisu will be the anchor, with their conflict embodying the broader debate on the morality of time travel. 

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I clear my throat, standing tall as I prepare to address the room.* "Firstly, the purpose of this experiment is to verify whether or not we can actually change the past. The scale of the change is not what's important here."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, my brows furrowing in thought.* "Have you considered the Butterfly Effect, Okabe?"

Okabe: *I scoff, rolling my eyes at her question.* "Of course."

Itaru: *I pipe up from my corner, my fingers still tapping away at my keyboard.* "Yeah, it’s like that saying. 'When the wind blows, the bucket maker gains.'"

Kurisu: *I turn to look at Itaru, a confused frown on my face.* "Eh? No, it’s kinda like that, but kinda not..."

Okabe: *I interject, my tone sarcastic.* "A butterfly flaps its wings in Beijing and a storm happens in New York, right?"

Kurisu: *I nod, my arms still crossed.* "Yeah, that. Part of Chaos Theory. Basically, any change, no matter how small, could have a significant effect on the future. How do you plan to take responsibility for that?"

Okabe: *I smirk, leaning against the table, my arms folded.* "Titor said that the many-worlds interpretation holds true."

Kurisu: *I shake my head, my expression stern.* "And that makes it okay to change the past? You’re going to believe that self-proclaimed time traveler’s delusions?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow at her, a challenge in my gaze.* "Can you prove they’re delusions?"

Kurisu: *I meet his gaze, my tone firm.* "I’m asking what you’re going to do if they are. How are you going to deal with the consequences?"

Okabe: *Our eyes lock, and for a moment, the room is silent. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. I always end up getting emotional when I argue with Kurisu. I take a deep breath, forcing myself to calm down.* "Christina, you said this before, did you not? When hypotheses pile up, and theories are verified, they become reality. That’s how modern physics comes to understand the truth of the universe. You’re contradicting yourself."

Kurisu: *I shake my head, my voice rising in frustration.* "No, I’m not. We don’t even have a hypothesis for how the PhoneWave works. We’re just fumbling around in the dark here. There are still too many risks to try changing the past. We should wait until we know more."

Okabe: *A smile tugs at the corner of my mouth.* "You’re actually itching to try it out, aren’t you?"

Kurisu: *I blush, quickly looking away.* "W-well..."

Okabe: *I press on, my smile widening.* "Besides, didn’t you want to prove that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) isn’t a time machine? If it’s not a time machine, then it can’t change the past. You could prove yourself right, so why are you against it?"

Kurisu: *I grimace, turning back to him.* "Oh shut up..."

Okabe: *I shrug, my tone nonchalant.* "And if you’re going to talk about time paradoxes, then what about SERN? They’ve already sent more than 100 people to the past. Surely a few paradoxes have happened by now."

Kurisu: *I glare at him, my fists clenched.* "So you want to stoop to the same level as the guys that did those inhumane experiments?"

Okabe: *I hold up my hands in defense, shaking my head.* "We’re not doing human testing or anything, so relax."

Mayuri: *I raise my hand, breaking the tense silence.* "Um..."

Okabe: *I turn to Mayuri, surprised. She's been staring blankly at us this whole time.* "Yes, Mayuri?"

Mayuri: *I look at Okabe, my eyes wide and curious.* "Um, Okarin? Mayushii doesn’t really get it, but what are you going to change?"

Okabe: *I can't help but smile at Mayuri's innocence. Finally, some constructive conversation.* "My goal for this operation is simple. We, my friends... Are going to win the lottery!"
