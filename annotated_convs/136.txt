Okabe: *I feel a smirk pull at the corners of my mouth, my eyes gleaming with a manic intensity.* "Money? Okarin... that makes Mayushii sad. We should do something that will bring peace to the world! Like what if we give everybody in the whole wide world an Upa cushion?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my brows knitting together in confusion.* "Hmph. Peace, you say? Don’t be ridiculous. I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyo--"

Kurisu: *I interject sharply, my arms crossed and my gaze piercing.* "And here I thought you had ambition."

Okabe: *I scoff, my eyes rolling dramatically.* "Don’t get me wrong. This isn’t about world peace and it isn’t about ambition. It’s about discovering whether or not we can change the past. The easiest way to do that is to see if we can win the lottery, right?"

Kurisu: *I narrow my eyes, my lips pressing into a thin line.* "But your primary goal is the money, isn’t it?"

Okabe: *I throw my arms out, a wild grin spreading across my face.* "With that kind of money, I could say goodbye to this rickety old building! Muhahaha! I could get an office in Daibiru or UPX!"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, my voice dripping with sarcasm.* "See? Just like I thought."

Okabe: *I lean in closer, my voice dropping to a whisper.* "I won’t whitewash it. If we moved, we could experiment as much as we want without fear of Mister Braun. If we had money, we could build the Future Gadgets of our dreams. And of course, we could buy a truckload of Mayuri’s favorite bananas."

Mayuri: *My eyes widen, a gasp escaping my lips.* "A t-truckload?"

Kurisu: *I wave my hands frantically, my voice filled with urgency.* "No, Mayuri-san! Don’t let him tempt you!"

Okabe: *I shoot a glare at Kurisu, my voice harsh.* "Shut it, Celeb Seventeen!"

Kurisu: *I blink in surprise, my cheeks flushing.* "S-se...? Serendipity?"

Okabe: *I scoff, rolling my eyes.* "Celeb. Seventeen."

Kurisu: *I frown, my voice rising in frustration.* "What the hell is that supposed to mean!?"

Okabe: *I lean back, my arms crossed over my chest.* "You live in a hotel off of your parents’ money. You could never understand the plight of poor students like us."

Kurisu: *I watch as Kurisu sulks, a smirk tugging at my lips.* "What do you think, Moeka-san?"

Kurisu: *I glance towards Moeka, but she remains silent.* "Um...?"

Okabe: *I chuckle under my breath, a smug grin on my face.* "If you’re going to complain, then suggest an alternative. A change to the past that would be both trivial and easy to understand. Got anything?"

Kurisu: *I bite my lip, my gaze dropping to the floor.* "Um..."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my eyes filled with curiosity.* "Hmm?"

Kurisu: *I straighten up, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Let’s try changing the hotel I’m staying at."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, my tone dismissive.* "How are we supposed to know the difference? If you want to stay in Uguisudani, do it on your own. That should be easy for a Celeb Seventeen like you."

Kurisu: *I wince, my cheeks burning.* "Do you have to say it like that?"

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, a puzzled expression on my face.* "Anyway, why Uguisudani?"

Okabe: *I open my mouth to respond, but Kurisu cuts me off.* "Because that’s where all the love hotels ar--"

Kurisu: *I shoot a glare at Okabe, my voice cold and threatening.* "One more word out of you and I excise your frontal lobe with a rusty scalpel."

Okabe: *I gulp, my eyes widening in fear.* "Then how about we change my fried chicken to a different brand?"

Mayuri: *I blink, my brows furrowed in confusion.* "Nobody cares what brand of chicken you eat."
