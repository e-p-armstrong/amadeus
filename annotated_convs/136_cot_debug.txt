Okabe: "Is Mayuri there? If she is, let me speak to her!" *I demand, clutching the phone tightly in my hand.*

Luka: "Okay. Just a moment please." *He responds, his voice shaky from the other end of the line.*

Mayuri: "Tutturuâ™ª Mayushii here. What's up, Okarin?" *Her cheerful voice fills the room, oblivious to the urgency of the situation.*

Okabe: "Where are you now? Yanabayashi Shrine!?" *I ask, my heart pounding as I wait for her response.*

Mayuri: "Yup!" *She replies, her voice still cheerful and carefree.*

Okabe: "I'm headed there now. Whatever you do, don't move, okay!?" *I instruct, my voice filled with urgency.*

Mayuri: "Huh? Why not?" *She asks, confusion evident in her voice.*

Kurisu: *She stirs from her sleep, rubbing her eyes as she tries to focus on the conversation.* "What's all the commotion?" 

Okabe: "Daru. Assistant. Leave right now and get as far from Akiba as you can. But under no circumstances use the train." *I command, turning to face Kurisu and Daru.*

Itaru: "What? Why?" *He asks, his eyebrows furrowed in confusion.*

Okabe: "If you can, go somewhere you don't normally go, and stay there overnight. Understand?" *I say, my eyes darting between Kurisu and Daru.*

Itaru: "Wait, overnight? So you're saying we should go to a love hotel and make hanky panky. I understand." *He responds, a smirk playing on his lips.*

Kurisu: *She rolls her eyes at Daru's remark.* "Shut it, perv." *She mutters, finally fully awake. She gets up from her seat and moves closer to me.* "What's going on, Okabe?" *She asks, her voice filled with concern.*
