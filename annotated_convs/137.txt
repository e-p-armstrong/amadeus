Attacker A: "Target B in custody. Requesting pickup." *He announces, securing my hands behind my back.*

Okabe: *I wake up with a start, my head throbbing with pain.* "Aaaaahhhhhh!!" *I struggle against my restraints, managing to knock down the man guarding me and escape.*

Mayuri: "Okarin!" *She cries out as I stumble into the lab, her eyes welling up with tears at the sight of my battered body.*

Okabe: *I try to reach for her, but a man grabs me from behind and pulls me back.* 

Mayuri: "Ah!" *She falls to the floor, her eyes losing their light.*

Okabe: *In a fit of rage, I grab a chair and lift it high over my head, ready to destroy the Time Leap Machine.* 

Kurisu: "Stop, Okabe! What are you doing!?" *She cries out, stopping me in my tracks.*
