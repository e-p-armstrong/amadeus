Okabe: *Silence descends upon us. I glance at Kurisu and Mayuri, their faces deep in thought. I don't hold much hope for their ideas. My eyes shift to Moeka, whose gaze is locked onto her phone, her fingers unusually still. Daru, meanwhile, is off in his own world, engrossed in his moe news sites.* "Even with a time machine before you all, this is all you can think of. You guys sure lack imagination. If there are no other suggestions, we’ll use my plan."

Okabe: *I notice Kurisu's frown, but she doesn't voice any objections. As I suspected. She's intrigued by the possibility of changing the past. A true scientist at heart. But there's a hint of madness in her too, I can tell. Muhahaha!* *I pull out my phone, pressing it to my ear.* "It’s me. We’re beginning stage two of Operation Urd. Yeah, no problem. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall take all responsibility. Heh, don’t worry. Nothing will come back to you. Correct. This is my choice, and the choice of Steins Gate. Ragnarok is near. El Psy Kongroo."

Okabe: *I tuck my phone back into my pocket, my gaze sweeping over my fellow lab members.* "Now, begin the operation!"

Itaru: *I look around the room, confused.* "Uh, what do you want us to do?"

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, exasperated.* "Are you incapable of doing anything without my instructions?"

Mayuri: *I raise my hand, eager to contribute.* "First, we need to buy a lottery ticket."

Kurisu: *I interject, my tone practical.* "No, first we need a winning number."

Okabe: *I point a finger at Kurisu, grinning.* "Exactly, Celeb Seventeen! Now you’re talking."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, my brow furrowing.* "Don’t call me Celeb Seventeen."

Itaru: *I chime in, my gaze still on my computer screen.* "First, we have to decide which lottery to go for. Think we should go for Dream Summer Jumbo?"

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes lighting up.* "I saw a TV commercial for that the other day!"

Okabe: *I shake my head, dismissing their suggestions.* "Did they announce the winners?"

Itaru: *I scratch my head, thinking.* "Should be next week or the week after."

Okabe: *I sigh, running a hand through my hair.* "Then there’s no point! We can only send D-Mails to the past!"

Itaru: *I shrug, a sheepish grin on my face.* "Oh, right. We could wait until the Summer Jumbo drawing date."

Okabe: *I frown, my patience wearing thin.* "You’ve got your priorities backwards. Don’t get fixated on Summer Jumbo. Let’s look at the last lottery that announced its winners."

Itaru: *I nod, quickly typing into my computer.* "Hmmm, I’ll google it."

Kurisu: *I furrow my brow, deep in thought.* "If someone sent me the winning numbers from the future, would I believe it?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a puzzled look on my face.* "Um, Mayushii doesn’t even know how to buy a lottery ticket..."

Kurisu: *I smile at Mayuri, my tone reassuring.* "That’s okay. I don’t think teenage girls buy lottery tickets."

Okabe: *I turn to Moeka, who's been silent the entire time.* "Have you ever bought one, Moeka?"

Moeka: *I jump at the sound of my name, my shoulders tensing. I shake my head slightly, not daring to meet Okabe's gaze.*

Mayuri: *I look at Okabe, curious.* "How about you, Okarin?"

Okabe: *I shrug, a wry smile on my face.* "...I tried the LOTO SIX once."
