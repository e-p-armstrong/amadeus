Planning: 

The characters involved in this scene are Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru. 

Okabe is characterized by his paranoia and flamboyant personality, often over-dramatizing situations and thinking deeply about consequences. He is also very protective of his friends and takes on a leadership role. 

Kurisu is a serious, intelligent, and sarcastic character. She often acts as the voice of reason within the group. 

Mayuri is a sweet, innocent character who often doesn't fully grasp the gravity of the situation, and Itaru is a laid-back, good-natured character who often goes along with Okabe's plans.

For Okabe, I will add actions that convey his paranoia and leadership, such as fidgeting and taking charge of the conversation. 

For Kurisu, I will add actions that convey her skepticism and intelligence, such as raising her eyebrows or crossing her arms. 

For Mayuri, I will add actions that convey her innocence and naivety, such as tilting her head in confusion or smiling innocently. 

For Itaru, I will add actions that convey his laid-back nature, such as shrugging or leaning back in his chair.

The anchor line will be Okabe's line: "I’ll be the winner. That way, I shoulder all of the risk."

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I scan the screen, my eyes darting over the numbers displayed on the LOTO SIX homepage.* "Are you going to send this winning number in a D-Mail, Mayuri?" 

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a look of confusion spreading across my face.* "You mean we're going to tell them it's for LOTO SIX?" 

Okabe: *I nod, my fingers drumming on the table.* "Exactly."

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, my eyes widening as I read the screen.* "Last week’s 1st prize was... woah, 200 million!"

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat. I swallow hard, my palms growing sweaty.* "W-wait! 1st prize is too much!" 

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, an amused grin on my face.* "Why?"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, a small laugh escaping my lips.* "That is an awful lot of money... hahaha..."

Okabe: *I shake my head, my eyes darting around the room.* "No, not that. 1st place would be... too conspicuous."

Kurisu: *I furrow my brow, my gaze meeting Okabe's.* "What?"

Okabe: *I start pacing, my mind racing with possibilities.* "Don’t you get it!? I’m being chased by the Organization. If we win 1st prize, the media will cover the event and my cover will be blown!"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, a smirk playing on my lips.* "That’s stupid."

Mayuri: *I raise my hand, a hopeful smile on my face.* "What if Mayushii wins?"

Okabe: *I stop pacing, my eyes serious.* "No. Stage Two of Operation Urd does have its risks, just like Celeb Sev said."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, a smirk playing on my lips.* "Celeb... Sev? Don’t abbreviate it."

Okabe: *I stand tall, my gaze firm.* "I’ll be the winner. That way, I shoulder all of the risk."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, a smirk playing on my lips.* "And all of the money, right? I see your plan."

Okabe: *I ignore Kurisu’s remark, my mind racing with thoughts of the potential consequences of winning such a large sum. I shake my head, trying to dismiss the tempting prospect.* "Anyway, we should aim a little lower. Daru, how much is 2nd prize?"

Itaru: *I scroll down the page, my eyes scanning the numbers.* "Umm, looks like it was... 23 million yen."

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my palms growing sweaty.* "...L-let’s try 3rd prize."

Itaru: *I glance at Okabe, a smirk playing on my lips.* "That was only 700, 000 yen."

Okabe: *I nod, a relieved smile spreading across my face.* "Yeah, that’s good. That should be about right."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, a smirk playing on my lips.* "You’re such a chicken."

Okabe: *I laugh, a confident grin on my face.* "Heh, heh heh heh! That’s rich, coming from the one who was so worried about the risk of time paradoxes. Eh, Celeb Sev!?"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, a smirk playing on my lips.* "I’m begging you, stop calling me that. I’ll settle for assistant. And don’t misunderstand. I’m still worried about what could go wrong."

Okabe: *I shake my head, a confident grin on my face.* "I’m trying to minimize our risk by choosing an amount that’s just right. Stop being so stubborn."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, a smirk playing on my lips.* "...No, you."

Okabe: *I sigh, deciding to let Kurisu have the last word.*

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes wide with excitement.* "Um, could we fill a truckload of bananas with 700, 000 yen?"

Okabe: *I laugh, shaking my head at Mayuri's innocent question.* 

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, a smirk playing on my lips.* "For 3rd prize, you need to get five matching numbers."
