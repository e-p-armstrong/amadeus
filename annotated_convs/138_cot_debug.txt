Kurisu: "Are you trying to break the machine? You don't have to break it, Okabe. We already decided not to experiment. Remember? Anyway, put the chair down." *She says, stepping back slightly, watching me with worry in her eyes.*

Okabe: *I lower the chair slowly, not because she told me to, but because I realized the potential consequences of my actions.* "Yeah, I remember." 

Kurisu: "You look pale. What's wrong? Are you listening?" *She steps closer, her brows furrowed in concern.*

Okabe: *I turn away from her, unable to meet her gaze.* "I... I need some air."  

Kurisu: "W-wait!" *She calls out as I storm out of the lab.*

Okabe: *I wander aimlessly through the city, finally stopping on a pedestrian overpass. I squat down on the concrete, my thoughts consumed by despair.* "What am I doing here? Mayuri's about to die." 

Kurisu: "Hey. Don't you think you're a little old to be sitting on the ground in public?" *She says, her voice dripping with sarcasm as she approaches.*

Okabe: "...Christina." *I murmur, barely lifting my head.*

Kurisu: "What?" *She squats down next to me.* "What time is it now?"

Okabe: "5:38. Hey. If you have time to sit around, then you can help me with the shopping." *I remember the original timeline, the one where we shopped together.*

Kurisu: "Well? Are you going to come along or not?" *She asks, standing up and offering a hand to help me up.*

Okabe: "Kurisu." *I say, still looking at the ground.*

Kurisu: "...That's the first time you've said my name properly." *She says, her voice softer now.*

Okabe: "...Help me." *I finally look up at her, the desperation clear in my eyes.* "Help me..."

Kurisu: "Tell me what happened. I know you used the Time Leap Machine." *She says, leaning against the guardrail and looking away.*

Okabe: "...What?" *I ask, surprised.*

Kurisu: "You get a phone call, and suddenly you're like a different person. It was obvious." *She continues, still not meeting my gaze.*

Okabe: "I came from three hours in the future." *I admit, finally breaking the silence.*

Kurisu: "What happened?" *She asks, turning to face me again.*
