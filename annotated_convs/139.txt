Okabe: *I turn my gaze towards Moeka, her surprise evident as I call out her name.* "Figure out what to put in the D-Mail. It needs to convince an unknowing me one week ago to buy into the LOTO SIX."

Moeka: *She blinks at me, a hint of uncertainty in her eyes.* "...Me?"

Okabe: *I nod, a hint of a smile playing on my lips.* "You are the mail demon, so this should be right up your alley."

Okabe: *Despite her apparent lack of interest, Moeka nods in agreement and we set the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to forward to my phone.*

Kurisu: *She pulls on her lab coat with a sense of purpose, her eyes focused on the phone attached to the PhoneWave (name subject to change).* "Thursday last week... so about five days. Is that okay?"

Itaru: *He leans back in his chair, stroking his chin thoughtfully.* "The drawing was five days ago. It needs to arrive before that, right?"

Kurisu: *She nods, her fingers dancing over the keys as she inputs the time.* "We’ll send it to one week ago. 7 days is 168 hours, so let’s round up a bit and enter 170#."

Mayuri: *She repeats the numbers softly, her fingers tracing them in the air.* "Ummm, 1, 7, 0, #..."

Okabe: *After Moeka finishes typing the email into my phone, I review it, noting that we replaced the number 40 with 37 to avoid winning the top prizes.* "It’ll have to do."

Okabe: *I acknowledge the limitations of our message, knowing that we can only send 36 bytes. There’s only so much we can say.*

Mayuri: *She tilts her head, a small smile on her face.* "This mail’s kinda shady, huh? Ehehe!"

Moeka: *Her fingers hover over the erase button, her expression unreadable.* "...I’ll redo it."

Okabe: *I reach out, stopping Moeka from erasing the mail.* "It’s fine. I don’t think there’s any other way. Though it is kind of shady."

Mayuri: *She laughs, her eyes sparkling with amusement.* "Don’t worry! Okarin loves shady things, so it’s perfect!"

Okabe: *I can't help but roll my eyes at Mayuri's teasing. But with our preparations complete, I feel a sense of anticipation. It’s hard to believe that this is all it takes to send emails to the past.*

Okabe: *I raise my voice, a sense of grandeur infusing my words.* "The time has come. Prepare to open Steins Gate!"

Kurisu: *She crosses her arms, a frown creasing her brow.* "It’s been bugging me, but what is that Steins Gate thing?"

Mayuri: *She giggles, her voice filled with a playful tone.* "It’s Okarin’s catch phrase♪"

Okabe: *I shrug, a smirk on my face.* "Steins Gate is Steins Gate. Nothing more, nothing less."

Kurisu: *She sighs in exasperation, rolling her eyes at my cryptic response.* "That doesn’t explain anything."

Okabe: *I wave her off, my attention focused on the task at hand.* "Don’t complain about every little thing. That’s not important right now."

Okabe: *With a deep breath, I place my finger on the send button. My hands are shaking, but I fight to keep them steady.*

Itaru: *He cracks his knuckles, his voice filled with excitement.* "Starting up the microwave!"
