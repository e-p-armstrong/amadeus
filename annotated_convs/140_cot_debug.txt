## Plan
The characters involved are Okabe, Mayuri, Itaru, and Kurisu. 
- Okabe is the main character and the one experiencing the strange phenomena. He is typically dramatic and eccentric, but also deeply analytical. His *actions* and *thoughts* will reflect his confusion, shock, and growing fear as he realizes that something is wrong. 
- Mayuri is Okabe's childhood friend, a kind and gentle soul who cares deeply for Okabe. Her *actions* and *thoughts* will reflect her concern for Okabe's well-being.
- Itaru is a hardcore otaku who often engages in banter and lewd jokes. His *actions* and *thoughts* will reflect his generally laid-back personality and humor, but also his surprise at Okabe's strange behavior. 
- Kurisu is a genius scientist who is often serious and focused. Her *actions* and *thoughts* will reflect her irritation at Itaru's jokes and her curiosity about Okabe's behavior.

The anchor lines will be Okabe's realization that the email he sent arrived a week ago and his question to Kurisu about winning the LOTO SIX. The thematic direction here is shock and disbelief, as Okabe struggles to understand what's happening.

## Roleplay:
Okabe: *With a shaking hand, I press the button on my phone. The animation of a flying mail and the words 'Sending mail' appear on the screen. My heart pounds in my chest as the countdown begins. Suddenly, a wave of vertigo washes over me, making me feel as if I'm floating. The world around me blurs, turning monochrome. I clench my phone tighter, my body instinctively recoiling from the sensation that something is terribly wrong.*

Mayuri: *I look at Okabe, concern etched on my face.* "Okarin? Are you okay?"

Okabe: *I gasp, Mayuri's voice pulling me back to reality. Blinking, I look around and realize that color has returned to the world. Yet something feels off. I frown, trying to process what just happened.*

Mayuri: *Seeing Okabe's confusion, I wave my hand in front of his face.* "Are you okay?"

Okabe: *My gaze falls on my phone. It's showing the normal standby display, not the 'Mail Sent' message it should be showing. A chill runs down my spine as I glance around the lab. The PhoneWave isn't on. Daru, who was sitting in front of the X68000 just moments ago, is now in the lounge. Kurisu, who should be in the development room, is on the sofa with a technical book. Nothing makes sense.* "Mayuri, how long have I been standing here?"

Mayuri: "Eh? What do you mean?"

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, frustration seeping into my voice.* "Just tell me."

Mayuri: "Hm... maybe 30 seconds?"

Okabe: *My blood runs cold.* "30 seconds? Really?"

Mayuri: *I nod, a confused look on my face.* "Yup. You suddenly ran over to the PhoneWave, then you took out your phone and started going ’haaah haaah!"

Itaru: *Turning away from the computer, I call out to Mayuri.* "Say that again, Mayushii."

Mayuri: "Huh? You started going haah haah?"

Itaru: *I smirk, leaning back in my chair.* "The haah haah part!"

Mayuri: *I giggle, repeating the sound.* "Haah haah!"

Itaru: *I chuckle, wiggling my eyebrows.* "More sexy this time!"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, my fingers tightening around the book in my lap.* "Stop it, perv."

Okabe: *Ignoring their banter, I frantically check my mail. My heart nearly stops when I see the date on the received mail.* "The mail arrived a week ago."

Mayuri: "Hm? What’s going on?"

Okabe: *My mind races as I try to remember. The LOTO SIX... did I win?* "The money! Did I win the LOTO SIX?"

Okabe: *I search my memories, but come up empty. There's no recollection of buying a ticket, no joy of winning 3rd place. Nothing.* "Hey, Celeb Sev, did I win 3rd place?"

Kurisu: *I frown, my eyes narrowing.* "Don’t call me Celeb Sev! And 3rd place of what?"
