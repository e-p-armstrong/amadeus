Planning and Brainstorming:

Characters:
- Okabe: The main character, a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He's eccentric, dramatic, and quick to anger or panic. His actions and thoughts should be detailed and intense, filled with dramatic flair.
- Kurisu: A genius scientist, reserved and logical. She's often annoyed by Okabe's antics but cares deeply for her friends. Her actions should be calculated and reserved, showcasing her intelligence and patience.
- Itaru: Okabe's friend, a laid-back hacker. He's easygoing, loves technology, and often fantasizes about unrealistic scenarios. His actions should be casual and carefree, reflecting his easygoing nature.
- Mayuri: Okabe's childhood friend. She's naive, innocent, and sees the world with childlike wonder. Her actions should be cheerful, bubbly, and innocent, mirroring her personality.
- Luka: A timid and gentle boy who is often mistaken for a girl. He's shy and polite. His actions should be gentle and hesitant, mirroring his timid nature.
- Moeka: A reserved, shy girl who often communicates via text messages. She's often detached from the situation. Her actions should be quiet and reserved, emphasizing her introverted nature.

Anchors:
1. Okabe: "What the hell did you say just now!?" - Okabe's rising panic and confusion as he realizes that no one else remembers his D-Mail will be the first anchor.
2. Okabe: "I don’t know what’s going on anymore. Questions keep spinning around in my head." - Okabe's overwhelming confusion and fear as he fails to understand what's happening will serve as the second anchor.

Thematic Direction: The theme of this scene is confusion and disconnect, as Okabe grapples with the sudden shift in reality. The roleplay will emphasize Okabe's disorientation and the other characters' obliviousness to his distress.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *A sense of unease crawls up my spine, leaving a cold trail in its wake. I step towards Kurisu, her casual posture on the sofa a stark contrast to my mounting dread.* "What did you say just now?"

Kurisu: *I look at Okabe, taken aback by his sudden intensity.* "Wh-what?"

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest, the echo of each beat amplifying my growing panic.* "What the hell did you say just now!?"

Kurisu: *I meet Okabe's gaze, my eyes narrowing in response to his outburst.* "Got a problem? I asked what, and then you just--"

Okabe: *I interrupt her, my voice trembling with a mixture of fear and disbelief.* "Not that! You said ’3rd place of what’, right!? I mean 3rd place of LOTO SIX!"

Kurisu: *My eyebrows furrow in confusion, struggling to follow Okabe's erratic train of thought.* "What?"

Okabe: *I turn towards Daru, desperation seeping into every word.* "Daru! I sent myself the winning LOTO SIX numbers just now. Didn’t I?"

Itaru: *My eyes widen in realization, a grin spreading across my face.* "Holy crap! That’s brilliant, man! We can use D-Mails to make ourselves billionaires! I could buy all the computer parts I want and go to MayQueen for every meal of the day! I AM SO PUMPED UP!"

Okabe: *My blood runs cold. Their reactions are all wrong.* "Mayuri, you were gonna buy a truckload of bananas... right?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my brows knitting together in confusion.* "A truckload? Who’s gonna fill it up?"

Okabe: *I glance at Moeka, her gaze focused on the floor as usual. But even she can't hide the flicker of confusion that crosses her features.* "Wait! What happened to stage two of Operation Urd!?"

Kurisu: *I look at Okabe, struggling to follow his increasingly erratic behavior.* "By stage two, you mean an experiment to see if we can change the past, right?"

Okabe: *I clutch at the sliver of hope, my relief palpable.* "R-right! That’s it!"

Itaru: *I nod, my mind already considering the possibilities.* "Yeah, that’s why we’re all thinking."

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat, my confusion deepening.* "What?"

Mayuri: *I look at Okabe, my voice soft and earnest.* "About what to send, so we can tell if the past has changed."

Itaru: *I chuckle, my imagination running wild.* "I think we should definitely go with Okarin’s LOTO SIX idea."

Mayuri: *I shake my head, my voice gentle but firm.* "Mayushii thinks we shouldn’t be so greedy for dough. Ah, but when I say dough, I don’t mean like for baking."

Kurisu: *I smile, my tone dry.* "I think we all know what you mean."

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes lighting up.* "Really? That’s great! So, instead of being greedy, we should do something that will bring peace to the world! Like, if we gave everybody in the whole wide world an Upa cushion, I think everyone would be happy♪"

Itaru: *I snort, my amusement clear.* "The only ones who’d be happy are little kids and Mayu-shi."

Okabe: *My mind races, unable to keep up with their casual banter. They're acting like I never sent that D-Mail. Something is wrong. Very wrong.*

Luka: *I hesitantly push the front door open, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Um... hello?"

Mayuri: *I turn towards the door, my face lighting up.* "Ah, it’s Luka-kun! Welcome♪"

Luka: *I bow my head, an apology lingering on my lips.* "Pardon the sudden intrusion..."

Okabe: *I barely register Lukako's arrival, my mind a whirlwind of questions and fear. I can't stop sweating. And it’s not because of the heat. I don’t know what’s going on anymore. Questions keep spinning around in my head.*

Mayuri: *I look at Luka, my eyes shining with anticipation.* "Did you decide to wear one of Mayushii’s costumes? That would make me happy♪"
