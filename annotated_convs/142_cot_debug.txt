Planning:

Okabe: Protagonist and narrator of the scene. Often dramatic and flamboyant, but in this scene, he is in a state of confusion and frustration. His actions and thoughts will focus on his internal conflict, confusion, and his desperate attempts to understand what's happening.

Luka: Shy and timid, very apologetic and soft-spoken. His actions will be small, hesitant movements, indicative of his shy and timid personality.

Mayuri: Cheerful and caring, often taking the role of the group's peacekeeper. Her actions will be expressive, caring, and protective, especially when it comes to Luka.

Kurisu: Intelligent and straightforward, often acting as the voice of reason. Her actions will reflect her concern and confusion about Okabe's strange behavior.

Itaru: The group's tech expert and a bit of a comic relief. His actions will be a mixture of humor and curiosity.

Anchor Lines:

1. Okabe: "...What is it?" - This line will serve as the beginning of Okabe's confusion and frustration, marking the start of the unfolding mystery.
2. Okabe: "R-really? When was that!?" - This line will serve as the peak of Okabe's confusion, symbolizing his struggle to reconcile the conflicting narratives.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *Lukako's eyes meet mine, filled with an apologetic glint, and I sense he has something to say.* "...What is it?" *I ask, my voice sounding distant and mechanical, as if I'm not truly present in the conversation.*

Luka: *I nervously fidget with the hem of my shirt, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Actually, Okabe-san... I mean, Kyouma-san, there’s something I need to apologize for..." 

Okabe: *My eyebrows furrow in confusion as I try to comprehend what Lukako could possibly need to apologize for. As he timidly extends his hand, my heart skips a beat. Between his trembling fingers, he holds a LOTO SIX ticket, and the numbers... they're the same as the ones in my D-Mail!* "Ah...!" *Without thinking, I reach out, grabbing Lukako by his slender wrist.* "Where did you get this!?" 

Luka: "T-that hurts..."

Mayuri: *Seeing Lukako in distress, I quickly intervene.* "Don’t pick on Luka-kun!" *I say, placing myself between the two.*

Okabe: *Reluctantly, I let go of Lukako's wrist, shooting him an apologetic glance.*

Kurisu: *Crossing my arms, I raise an eyebrow at Okabe.* "What’s wrong with you, Okabe? You’re acting weird."

Itaru: *I chuckle awkwardly, trying to lighten the tense atmosphere.* "Is the heat getting to him?"

Okabe: "Sorry, Lukako, but I need to know. Where did you get that LOTO SIX ticket?" *I implore, my eyes desperately searching for answers in his.*

Luka: *I swallow hard, finding it difficult to meet Okabe's intense gaze.* "Um... you told me the numbers."

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, my mind racing to remember such an event.* "I... did?" *My question hangs in the air, unanswered, as Lukako nods, his eyes shimmering with unshed tears.*

Luka: "You told me to buy them because they might win..."

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest as I try to make sense of what's happening.* "R-really? When was that!?" 

Luka: "A week ago..."

Okabe: *My mind screams in protest, berating my past self for his actions. This wasn't supposed to happen. But it has. The past has changed. Or has it? It feels like it has, yet the present seems to have shifted as well.*

Itaru: "Wait, did Luka-shi win the LOTO SIX?"

Mayuri: "Wow! Okarin’s a psychic!" *I exclaim, my eyes sparkling with excitement.*

Kurisu: "Don’t tell me... you sent the winning numbers with the PhoneWave?" *I ask, my voice laced with disbelief.*

Okabe: "Why are you asking me that? You saw me send them." *I retort, feeling a strange disconnect between our narratives.*

Kurisu: "I did? What are you talking about?" *I question, my confusion growing.*

Okabe: "I sent the winning numbers in a D-Mail just now. We discussed it and decided that’s what we would do. You all watched it happen. Then the past changed. It actually changed." *My voice echoes in the room, a stark testament to the unbelievable power we now hold.*

Itaru: "Hold on, Luka-shi! How much did you win!?"

Okabe: "700, 000, right? 3rd place." *I answer with conviction, despite the growing unease in my gut.*

Luka: "Um..." *I begin to fidget, feeling a wave of guilt wash over me.* 

Okabe: *I watch Lukako's strange behavior, a sense of foreboding creeping up my spine.*

Luka: "I’m really sorry, Kyouma-san. Even though you told me exactly what to do, I... Filled one of the numbers in wrong..." 

Okabe: *My eyes widen in disbelief as I stare at the numbers on the ticket in Lukako’s trembling hands.*

Luka: "Um... if that ’18’ had been a ’19’, then it would’ve been 3rd place... just like Kyouma-san said."

Itaru: "Nooo! So close! And yet so far!" *I groan in frustration, my comic relief personality momentarily forgotten in the face of this missed opportunity.*
