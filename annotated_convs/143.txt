Okabe: "Then what do we do!?" *I clench my fists, my voice echoing off the walls of the lab.*

Kurisu: "Calm down." *She says, her voice steady and calm, despite my outburst.*

Okabe: "How can I calm down!?" *I turn to her, my eyes wide with desperation.* "Do you know how many times I've seen Mayuri die!? Covered in blood! Gasping for breath! The light fading from her eyes! Again... and again... and again... And all I could do... was watch!"

Kurisu: *She looks at me, her expression impassive.* "Getting emotional won't solve anything."

Okabe: "You're only calm because you weren't there!" *I snap, my gaze hardening.*

Kurisu: "...True. I don't know what happens five hours from now. To be honest, it doesn't feel real at all. But it's not like I don't believe you. You have to stay strong, Okabe." *She reaches out, patting my arm gently.*

Okabe: "...Sorry." *I sigh, running a hand through my hair.* "What I don't understand is how the cause can change but the effect can stay the same. It's like causality itself is broken."

Kurisu: "Maybe Kiryu Moeka shooting her isn't the real cause of her death. Maybe it's something larger and less obvious. For example, maybe she dies because we invented a time machine, or because SERN discovered our hacking. If that's the cause, then it doesn't really matter how she dies. Causality remains intact."

Okabe: "Can that theory explain why Nae pushed her in front of a train?" *I ask, my brow furrowing in confusion.*

Kurisu: "Oh, right... hmm... Anyway, the principle of causality is absolute. Deny that, and you deny all of physics. There must be a distinct cause for Mayuri's death."

Okabe: "So if we figure out what it is, then maybe we can save her." 

Kurisu: "Not necessarily." *She shakes her head, looking thoughtful.*

Okabe: "What do you mean?" *I look at her, waiting for her explanation.*

Kurisu: "The problem is when the causal event occurred. If it happened too far in the past... then there's nothing we can do."

Okabe: "But I can travel to any time I had a cell phone, can't I!?" *I ask, my hope returning.*

Kurisu: "No. It's still theoretical, but I believe that one leap with our machine has a maximum range of 48 hours."

Okabe: "48 hours... I can only go back two days!?" *I stare at her in disbelief.* "Why didn't you tell me that before!?"

Kurisu: "Before what? I just finished the Time Leap Machine, remember?" *She raises an eyebrow, clearly puzzled by my question.*

Okabe: "Future you didn't say anything about it either." 

Kurisu: "Oh, so that's what you mean. Maybe she just didn't have the chance." *She shrugs, considering my words.*

Okabe: "So how come I can only leap 48 hours?" 

Kurisu: "I don't know. Even I don't understand everything that's going on inside that thing. But you can do consecutive leaps. That is, as long as the Time Leap Machine exists. For example, if the Time Leap Machine remains functional for ten straight years, you could leap back to this moment ten years from now. Of course, it would take a total of 1825 leaps, so I don't recommend it. Still, it's theoretically possible."

Okabe: "Then what's the problem?" *I ask, starting to feel desperate again.*

Kurisu: "Weren't you listening? I said, as long as the Time Leap Machine exists. When was the machine completed?"

Okabe: "...Ah." *The realization hits me like a ton of bricks, and I sink down onto the nearest chair.*

Kurisu: "Exactly. An hour ago. August 13th, 2010. 2:00 PM, or thereabouts. It didn't exist before then. It's impossible to use the machine before 2 PM today." *She confirms, her gaze sympathetic.*

Okabe: "I can't go back farther than 2 PM on the 11th!?" *I exclaim, the weight of her words sinking in.*

Kurisu: "Most likely." *She nods, her expression grave.*

Okabe: "Can't you improve it!?" *I rise from my chair, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Kurisu: "Eventually, maybe, but certainly not now. I'd need a real laboratory with real equipment. It would be expensive, which means we'd need sponsors. And if we go looking, I'm pretty sure SERN would crush us. I'd say that's proven by the fact that neither you nor I have leapt here from the far future yet." *She concludes, her eyes meeting mine with a grim determination.*
