Okabe: *I stare at the blank screen of my phone, the message that should be there, isn't. It's as if it's been erased from existence, along with everyone's memories.* "This can't be..." *With a heavy sigh, I slip the phone into my pocket, ignoring the worried glances of my friends. I need some space, some fresh air to clear my head. I move to the door, stepping out into the streets, the bustle of the city a welcome distraction from my swirling thoughts.*

Suzuha: *With a rag in hand, I'm polishing my bicycle, my every movement measured and precise. Suddenly, I catch sight of Okabe stepping out of the lab, his face etched with worry.* "Hey there, Okabe Rintaro."

Okabe: *I turn to the sound of Suzuha's voice, a question burning in my eyes.* "Brainwashed? Me?"

Suzuha: *I chuckle softly, tossing the rag onto the handlebars of the bike.* "Well, there’s nobody else here."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a half-smile tugging at my lips.* "...I suppose you’re right."

Suzuha: *I tilt my head, curious.* "Which part? Being brainwashed? Or nobody else being here?"

Okabe: *I let out a dry laugh, running a hand through my hair.* "Being brainwashed."

Suzuha: *My eyes widen in surprise, my heart pounding in my chest.* "You... were?"

Okabe: *I let out a yelp of surprise as Suzuha suddenly steps up to me, her fingers prying my eyes open.* "Nwohh!? Wh-wh-what are you doing!?"

Suzuha: *I keep my gaze focused, my fingers steady.* "Don’t move."

Okabe: *I blink rapidly as Suzuha finally releases my face, taking a step back.* "...What?"

Suzuha: *I rub the back of my neck, my gaze averted.* "When you’re brainwashed, they usually put a chip on the inside of your lower eyelid."

Okabe: *I touch my eyelid gingerly, my mind reeling at the thought.* "A... chip?"

Suzuha: *My eyes widen in realization, and I quickly cover my mouth.* "Okabe Rintaro. Please keep that confidential."

Okabe: *I gaze at her, a wild excitement building in my chest.* "So you’ve been captured by the Organization before. Just like me."

Suzuha: *I blink, taken aback.* "...Huh? The Organization? Are you talking about SERN?"

Okabe: *I hold up a hand, silencing her.* "No! Say no more. I understand your pain all too well."

Suzuha: *I look at him, confusion etched on my face.* "Y-you do?"

Okabe: *I nod solemnly, my voice barely above a whisper.* "The Organization’s secret brainwashing facility, known as Apocalypse of Galient. That place is a living hell. I don’t want to revive any suppressed memories."

Suzuha: *I let out a soft sigh, my shoulders sagging.* "Um, right. I don’t think it was called Apokawhatever, though... But it certainly was a living hell."

Okabe: *I clap her on the shoulder, a grim smile on my face.* "I can tell you’ll make a good comrade, Part-Time Warrior. The day of Ragnarok is near!"

Suzuha: *I blink in surprise, then give a weak smile, lifting my hand in a half-hearted salute.* "C-cool!"

Nae: *I tug on Suzuha's sleeve, my voice small and confused.* "Suzuha, what’s ’brain watching’?"

Okabe: *I let out a maniacal laugh, my eyes gleaming with excitement.* "Heh heh heh. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall be the one to answer that."

Nae: *I squeak in surprise, quickly hiding behind Suzuha.* "Eh!? No... that’s okay."

Suzuha: *I laugh, ruffling Nae's hair affectionately.* "Ahaha! Looks like Nae’s afraid of you, Okabe Rintaro."
