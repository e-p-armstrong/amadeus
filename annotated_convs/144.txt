Okabe: "We can't do anything!?" *I pace the room, my hands pulling at my hair in frustration.* "Even with the Time Leap Machine, we can't stop SERN from killing Mayuri five hours from now!?"

Okabe: *Suddenly, a sound from outside the window breaks my train of thought. I rush over and peer out, my heart pounding.* "What? Is it Moeka!?" *I mumble to myself, my eyes scanning the street below.* "Did she overhear us!?" *My gaze lands on Suzuha, her bike fallen over, her face pale.* "...Huh?"

Okabe: *I squint, trying to make sense of Suzuha's lips moving in silent whispers. I can't hear her, but her agitation is clear.* "Hey!" *I call out, but she's already on her bike, speeding away.* 

Okabe: *A sense of unease settles over me.* "She's acting strange." *I whisper, turning back to the room.* "I smell a conspiracy. Moeka was a spy. Could Suzuha be the same? It's too dangerous to trust anyone." *I mutter, my mind racing.* "Suzuha has exhibited suspicious behavior, though not as much as Moeka has. She's openly hostile towards Kurisu, and she was able to take down SERN's hit squad singlehandedly." *My thoughts turn to her elusive father. Could he be John Titor? The one posting on the internet? What is the meaning of the name Barrel Titor? My instincts scream that Suzuha knows something. And I need to find out what.* "I need to follow her," *I decide, heading for the door.*

Kurisu: "Hey! Where are you going!?" *She calls out, her eyes wide with concern as she watches me dash out of the lab.*
