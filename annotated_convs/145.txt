Okabe: *I lean in closer, my eyes darting between the two girls.* "...How much do you know about time travel?"

Suzuha: *I raise an eyebrow, crossing my arms over my chest.* "...What do you mean by that?"

Okabe: *I begin to explain our recent experiment, my hands moving in tandem with my words, painting a vivid picture of our time travel venture.*

Suzuha: *I blink in disbelief, my arms falling to my sides.* "...I don’t believe it."

Suzuha: *I shake my head, trying to comprehend the weight of his words.* "I’ve never heard of anything like that. Is it true? Are you telling the truth?"

Okabe: *I straighten my back, my chest swelling with pride.* "Of course. We've made a discovery that will change the course of history. A bona-fide time machine! We were able to alter the past, and no one, absolutely no one, can deny our revolutionary accomplishments!"

Suzuha: *I flinch, my hands instinctively reaching up to grip my hair.* "Geez! That’s not what I meant!"

Suzuha: *I release a deep sigh, running my fingers through my hair as I contemplate his words.* "I don’t know if what you’re saying is true or not, but..."

Suzuha: *I lower my voice, leaning in to share my suggestion.* "I think you should try asking John Titor."

Okabe: *My eyes widen in realization.* "...John Titor?"

Suzuha: *I nod, my eyes serious.* "I mean, he’s a hot topic now, isn’t he? A time traveler from the future! He might know something. Since you’re both time travelers and all."

Okabe: *I clench my fists, determination filling my eyes.* "I see... You could be right! No, there’s no doubt about it!"

Okabe: *With renewed vigor, I quickly pull out my phone, ready to make a crucial call.* "It’s me. John Titor may have come from the future to guide me. Yes, that’s right. His arrival here in 2010 must be the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo."

Nae: *I tilt my head, confusion etched on my face.* "Who is he talking to?"

Suzuha: *I shrug, a smirk playing on my lips.* "Dunno. Who could it be? Maybe it’s someone from the future."

Nae: *My eyes light up with excitement.* "From the future...!"

Okabe: *I glance at Nae, a grin spreading across my face.* "...Do you want to know who I’m talking to, Sister Braun?"

Nae: *I quickly shake my head, my eyes wide with fear.* "N-no, I..."

Okabe: *I let out a deep sigh, my expression softening.* "Good. Even if you are interested, never ask. I could tell you, but then I’d have to silence you. And I don’t want to have to do that to an innocent girl."

Nae: *I gasp, backing away slightly.*

Suzuha: *I step in, shooting Okabe a disapproving look.* "Come on, stop scaring her. She’s just a little girl."

Okabe: *I nod solemnly, understanding the weight of my actions.* "I’ll get in touch with Titor immediately. Your advice is appreciated, Part-Time Warrior!"

Suzuha: *I let out a laugh, my shoulders relaxing.* "Ahaha, was I useful? That’s gr--"

Suzuha: *I suddenly stop, my eyes widening as I spot something in the distance.* "Oh crap! The boss is back! The boss is back!"

Okabe: *I follow her gaze, spotting the approaching moped and the large figure riding it.* 

Suzuha: *I quickly turn to Nae, urgency in my voice.* "Nae, if Manager asks, tell him I was doing my job!"
