Okabe: *I extend my hand, offering Suzuha my handkerchief.* *She hesitates, looking at me for a second, then takes it and ties it around her burned hand.*

Suzuha: "...Thanks." *She gives me a grateful nod.*

Okabe: *I wrap a towel around her hand to prevent the people around us from staring, concerned about her condition.*

Mayuri: "Welcome back, Okarin!" *She waves cheerfully as we enter the lab.* "Oh! Suzu-san's with you too♪"

Okabe: *I find Mayuri and Daru in the lab.* "I thought I sent you two home!" *I say, trying to keep my voice steady.* "Why are you still here?" 

Mayuri: "I really thought we should celebrate the birth of Super PhoneWave-chan!" *She explains cheerfully.* "So Daru-kun and I went shopping♪"

Okabe: *I glance at Kurisu, seeing her worry mirrored in my own eyes.* 

Kurisu: *She leans closer to me, whispering* "W-what do we do?"

Okabe: *I keep my gaze focused on Mayuri, speaking softly to Kurisu.* "Make absolutely sure Mayuri doesn't find out."

Itaru: "What are you guys whispering about?" *He looks at us suspiciously.*

Kurisu: "Um..." *She stammers, taken aback by his question.*
