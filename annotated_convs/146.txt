Okabe: "We're not playing around here, Daru." *I say firmly, the serious tone in my voice contrasting with the usual playful banter.*

Mayuri: "What year were you born?" *She asks Suzuha, her eyes wide with curiosity.*

Suzuha: "2017." *She answers without hesitation, maintaining eye contact with each of us.*

Mayuri: "That's in seven years... You haven't been born yet, but you're here. Uh... huh???" *She trails off, her head tilting in confusion.*

Okabe: "Alright, Suzuha. Let's hear it." *I lean forward, resting my elbows on my knees, signaling her to continue.*

Suzuha: "Well, the gist is what I posted on @channel. I came from the future, the year 2036. In my time, the world is a dystopia ruled by SERN. There's no war, no conflict, but no freedom either." *She says with a solemn expression, her gaze never wavering.*

Mayuri: "Diss-tope-ear?" *She stumbles over the unfamiliar word, looking to us for clarification.*

Kurisu: "A society where every activity is controlled by the government. In a dystopia, you're not allowed to eat bananas unless today is banana-eating day. If you break that rule, they throw you in jail without a trial." *She explains, using her hands to emphasize her point.*

Mayuri: "That's terrible! Mayushii loves bananas..." *She clutches her heart, a look of shock on her face.*

Suzuha: "I'm part of the Resistance fighting to free humanity from SERN's control. I came to the past to change my present. From your point of view, I guess I should say the future. To change the future." *She clenches her fists in determination, her resolve unmistakable.*

Mayuri: "Um, what about finding your father? Was that a lie?" *She asks tentatively, her voice barely above a whisper.*

Kurisu: "SERN is a research institution. They don't have political power. I explained that to John Titor several times online." *She argues, crossing her arms and facing Suzuha.*

Okabe: "...Wait, don't tell me. You're 'KuriGohan and Kamehameha'!?" *I exclaim, my eyes widening in realization.*

Kurisu: *She turns red and looks away, clearly embarrassed.* "Titor came forward, so it's only fair that I do too." *She admits, her voice barely above a whisper.*
