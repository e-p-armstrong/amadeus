Planning:

Characters:

1. Tennouji: Stern, overprotective, but has a soft spot for his daughter. His actions are firm and decisive.
2. Okabe: The protagonist, a bit eccentric and dramatic, but also deeply caring and protective of those he loves. He's also a bit sarcastic and has a strong sense of responsibility.
3. Nae: Tennouji's daughter, a cheerful and innocent girl.
4. Suzuha: A part-time worker, seems to be a bit careless but also eager to please.
5. Mayuri: Sweet, innocent, and caring. She's always trying to lighten the mood and cheer people up.
6. Kurisu: A bit of a tsundere, she's intelligent, serious, and direct, but also has a soft spot for Okabe.

Writing styles:

1. Tennouji's actions will be firm, and his words will be stern but also filled with care when he's addressing his daughter.
2. Okabe's actions will be a mix of dramatic and serious, his thoughts will reveal his concern and worry about his friends.
3. Nae's actions will be cheerful and innocent.
4. Suzuha's actions will be a bit clumsy but eager.
5. Mayuri's actions will be comforting and warm.
6. Kurisu's actions will be direct but also show her concern for Okabe.

Anchor Lines: 

1. Okabe: "Hey, assistant. You’re not going back to your hotel?"
2. Kurisu: "You’re the lonely one, aren’t you? You’ve been acting gloomy all day. Do you need some advice? I’m an outsider, in a sense, so it should be easier to talk to me, right? A man getting advice from a younger woman is kind of *mumble mumble*, but if you’re fine with that, then just ask away."

Thematic Direction: 

The tension between Okabe and Kurisu will be the focus, their dialogue and actions will bring out their concern for each other and their dynamic relationship.

Roleplay:

Tennouji: *I cross my arms over my chest, leaning in towards Okabe with a stern gaze.* "Understand? I won’t let you off easy next time you make moves on my daughter."

Okabe: *I raise my hands in a defensive gesture, my eyes wide with mock fear.* "I wouldn’t do something so suicidal."

Tennouji: *Nodding in satisfaction, I turn my attention to my daughter, my stern expression softening.* "Nae, I bought some cream puffs, so let’s eat them together."

Nae: *I bounce on my toes, grinning up at my father.* "Okay!"

Tennouji: *I park my moped next to Suzuha's bicycle, then take my daughter's hand and lead her into the store.* "Hey, part-timer! I know you were slacking off! Hey! And why is the 42-inch on!? I thought I told you to turn it off!"

Suzuha: *I cringe, my hands flying up to protect my face.* "I’m sorryyyyy!"

Okabe: *Leaving Suzuha to her fate, I shake my head and make my way back to the lab, my mind racing with thoughts of Titor and the strange event I witnessed.* "Wait! We’ll talk when everything’s over." *I explain about Mr. Braun's return, and then dismiss everyone for the day.*

Mayuri: *I pick up my Upa plush toy from the sofa, offering it to Okabe with a comforting smile.* "Um, I’ll buy more bananas tomorrow, okay? So for now, hug this little guy suuuuper tight and cheer up, okay?"

Okabe: *I glance around the empty lab, my thoughts heavy. Eventually, my gaze lands on Kurisu.* "Hey, assistant. You’re not going back to your hotel?"

Kurisu: *I look up from my notebook, my eyebrows raising in surprise.* "Is there a problem?"

Okabe: *I shrug, leaning against the table.* "No, no problem. I was just wondering what you were still doing here."

Kurisu: *I close my notebook, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Nothing. I just wanted to think for a bit."

Okabe: *I smirk, my tone teasing.* "Can’t you think at your hotel?"

Kurisu: *I glare at him, my cheeks flushing slightly.* "What? You’re kicking me out?"

Okabe: *I chuckle, trying to lighten the mood.* "Ahh, I get it. You’d be lonely in your hotel room, but you have no friends, so you want me, the great Hououin Kyouma, to look after you. Isn’t that right, you spoiled Celeb Sev?"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, but there's a hint of concern in my gaze.* "You’re the lonely one, aren’t you? You’ve been acting gloomy all day. Do you need some advice? I’m an outsider, in a sense, so it should be easier to talk to me, right? A man getting advice from a younger woman is kind of *mumble mumble*, but if you’re fine with that, then just ask away."
