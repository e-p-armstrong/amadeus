Kurisu: "Apotheosized?" *She frowns, the unfamiliar term clearly throwing her off.*

Itaru: "In Japanese, please." *He interjects, a confused expression on his face.*

Suzuha: "Apotheosized, as in revered, respected." *She clarifies, her tone steady and composed.* 

Kurisu: "Respected? Huh!? I-I am!?" *She stammers, taken aback by this revelation.*

Suzuha: "In 2010, you pioneer time leap technology. Afterwards, you contribute to the development of SERN's time machine. That's what I know about Makise Kurisu." *She explains, her gaze fixed on Kurisu.*

Okabe: "Then I must be the father of the time machine, right?" *I ask, a playful smirk tugging at my lips.*

Suzuha: "Okabe Rintaro is a terrorist in 2036. You're pretty infamous." *She answers, her gaze shifting to me.*

Okabe: "Wha..." *My smirk fades, replaced by a look of disbelief.*

Kurisu: "I help SERN build their time machine? I don't believe it. SERN experiments on people against their will. They're a disgrace to scientists everywhere. I would never collaborate with them." *She protests, her voice filled with conviction.*

Suzuha: "But that's how it is in the future." *She asserts, her tone leaving no room for argument.*

Kurisu: "How did the future me explain herself?" *She asks, her brows furrowed in thought.*

Suzuha: "We've never met. By 2036, you're already dead... sorry." *She answers, her voice softening slightly.*

Kurisu: "Well... that's just great. I don't even make it to fifty?" *She mutters, her voice laced with bitter sarcasm.*

Suzuha: "In my time, there are two kinds of people: those who live extremely long lives, and those who die young, under suspicious circumstances. People who act against SERN are erased." *She explains, her gaze steady and unflinching.*

Kurisu: "T-they erased me?" *She stammers, her eyes wide with shock.*

Suzuha: "...Maybe you were being used by SERN too. Maybe they took your parents hostage and forced you to work on their time machine." *Her gaze softens, showing a rare moment of sympathy.*

Kurisu: "No... does that mean Mama's in danger?" *She gasps, her hands clenching into fists.*
