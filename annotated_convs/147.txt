Okabe: *I rise from the worn-out sofa, the fabric groaning under my weight.* "I need to send some emails. If you insist on staying here, then be quiet and stay out of my way. Okay, Zombie?" *I say, my voice holding a hint of frustration, but also a strange, underlying urgency.*

Kurisu: *I frown, my arms crossed over my chest.* "Of all your stupid names, that one’s the worst." *I complain, but make no move to leave. Instead, I settle down on the sofa, opening up a massive technical book that's filled with complex English phrases.*

Okabe: *I pause for a moment, glancing at her with a raised eyebrow.* "Want some coffee?" *I ask, my tone softer now, a subtle olive branch extended in the midst of our usual banter.*

Kurisu: *I look up from my book, a faint hint of surprise in my eyes.* "Sure." *I respond, my tone neutral, but not entirely dismissive.*

Okabe: *I busy myself with making some instant coffee for Kurisu, the familiar routine calming my nerves. As the coffee machine whirs to life, I grab a fresh Dr P from the refrigerator, the cool can grounding me in reality. I sit down in front of the computer, my fingers poised over the keyboard, my mind racing with questions and doubts.*

Kurisu: *I glance at him from the corner of my eye, his constant movement distracting me from my book.* "What’s wrong with you? Stop fidgeting." *I admonish, my tone icy, my gaze hard.*

Okabe: *My gaze flickers to Kurisu, my mind racing with questions and doubts. But instead of voicing them, I take out my phone, my fingers moving over the screen with a practiced ease. I let out a heavy sigh, the weight of my concerns making my shoulders slump.*

Kurisu: *I look up from my book, my eyes meeting his briefly.* "That was a pretty heavy sigh." *I comment, my tone neutral, my gaze returning to the pages of my book.*

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my gaze fixed on my phone's screen, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Christina. There’s something I want to talk to you about." *I say, my voice serious, my gaze finally moving to meet hers.*

Kurisu: *I glance at him, my eyebrows furrowing in slight confusion.* "Shouldn’t you answer your phone first?" *I ask, my tone questioning, my gaze moving to the phone in his hand.*

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, a faint smirk tugging at the corners of my mouth.* "It’s Daru. It’s probably something stupid." *I say, my tone dismissive, my mind already focused on the conversation I need to have with Kurisu.*
