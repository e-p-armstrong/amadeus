Planning:
Characters:
1. Okabe: A self-proclaimed mad scientist with a flair for the dramatic. He's intelligent, eccentric, and deeply caring, although he often hides this under a facade of indifference or arrogance. He can be serious when the situation calls for it, and he's deeply committed to his friends.
2. Kurisu: A genius scientist who is often the voice of reason in the group. She's slightly tsundere, often reacting with cold indifference or slight irritation to Okabe's antics, but she's also deeply curious and dedicated to her work. She's a bit of a loner, often immersing herself in her research.

Key Lines:
1. Okabe's line about needing to send some emails could be expanded to reveal his mental state and the gravity of the situation. 
2. Okabe's line about wanting to talk to Kurisu could be another emotional anchor, showcasing the trust and reliance he's placing on her, despite their often antagonistic interactions.

Writing Styles:
1. Okabe: His lines will be filled with dramatic flair and eccentricity, but also reveal his underlying concern and seriousness. His actions might be a bit exaggerated, but also reveal his thought process and dedication.
2. Kurisu: Her lines will be more direct and to the point, showcasing her practicality and intelligence. Her actions might be more subtle, hinting at her underlying emotions and thoughts.

Roleplay:
Okabe: *I rise from the worn-out sofa, the fabric groaning under my weight.* "I need to send some emails. If you insist on staying here, then be quiet and stay out of my way. Okay, Zombie?" *I say, my voice holding a hint of frustration, but also a strange, underlying urgency.*

Kurisu: *I frown, my arms crossed over my chest.* "Of all your stupid names, that one’s the worst." *I complain, but make no move to leave. Instead, I settle down on the sofa, opening up a massive technical book that's filled with complex English phrases.*

Okabe: *I pause for a moment, glancing at her with a raised eyebrow.* "Want some coffee?" *I ask, my tone softer now, a subtle olive branch extended in the midst of our usual banter.*

Kurisu: *I look up from my book, a faint hint of surprise in my eyes.* "Sure." *I respond, my tone neutral, but not entirely dismissive.*

Okabe: *I busy myself with making some instant coffee for Kurisu, the familiar routine calming my nerves. As the coffee machine whirs to life, I grab a fresh Dr P from the refrigerator, the cool can grounding me in reality. I sit down in front of the computer, my fingers poised over the keyboard, my mind racing with questions and doubts.*

Kurisu: *I glance at him from the corner of my eye, his constant movement distracting me from my book.* "What’s wrong with you? Stop fidgeting." *I admonish, my tone icy, my gaze hard.*

Okabe: *My gaze flickers to Kurisu, my mind racing with questions and doubts. But instead of voicing them, I take out my phone, my fingers moving over the screen with a practiced ease. I let out a heavy sigh, the weight of my concerns making my shoulders slump.*

Kurisu: *I look up from my book, my eyes meeting his briefly.* "That was a pretty heavy sigh." *I comment, my tone neutral, my gaze returning to the pages of my book.*

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my gaze fixed on my phone's screen, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Christina. There’s something I want to talk to you about." *I say, my voice serious, my gaze finally moving to meet hers.*

Kurisu: *I glance at him, my eyebrows furrowing in slight confusion.* "Shouldn’t you answer your phone first?" *I ask, my tone questioning, my gaze moving to the phone in his hand.*

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, a faint smirk tugging at the corners of my mouth.* "It’s Daru. It’s probably something stupid." *I say, my tone dismissive, my mind already focused on the conversation I need to have with Kurisu.*
