Planning/Brainstorming:

In this scene, Okabe, the eccentric, self-proclaimed mad scientist, attempts to explain the concept of D-Mail and his ability to remember changes in the past to Kurisu, a logical and skeptical scientist. Following this, Okabe receives a call from Itaru, his right-hand man, and then from Mayuri, his childhood friend. 

Okabe: He is flamboyant and tends to dramatize his actions. He's dramatic, eccentric, and a bit paranoid. His actions will be grand, his thoughts will be filled with dramatic flair and a touch of paranoia.

Kurisu: She is logical, stern, and somewhat cold. Her actions will be controlled, her expressions will be restrained, and her thoughts will be analytical.

Itaru: He is an easygoing, carefree hacker. His actions will be relaxed, his words will be casual, and his thoughts will be humorous.

Mayuri: She is cheerful, innocent, and caring. Her actions will be lively, her expressions will be bright, and her thoughts will be filled with warmth and concern for Okabe.

The anchor lines will be Okabe's dramatic declaration of his "Reading Steiner" ability and Kurisu's skeptical response, as these lines encapsulate their characters and the tension between them. Okabe's final line, where he declares himself a mad scientist, will also be an anchor as it reaffirms his eccentric character. 

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I gaze into Kurisu's eyes, my voice heavy with conviction.* "You might not remember this, but earlier, I changed the past with a D-Mail."

Kurisu: *I feel her scrutinizing gaze on me, her expression even more stern than usual.* "...I haven’t known you long enough to tell whether you’re serious."

Okabe: *I meet her gaze, undeterred.* "It happened. And then everyone except me forgot about it. Or rather, the fact that it happened was erased from history."

Kurisu: "The past changed, so the present changed with it? The Butterfly Effect, huh. But what you’re saying is nonsense."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, intrigued by her skepticism.* "Why do you say that?"

Kurisu: "Why do you remember that the past changed? If you used a time machine to physically travel to the past and change history, then that might explain it -- barely. But with a D-Mail, you haven’t taken one step outside the present, have you?’ So if the present changed, and we changed with it, you would have to change too. Or are you saying you didn’t change because you’re the observer? In that case, you’re claiming that you’re not a human being."

Okabe: *I understand what Kurisu’s saying, and I don’t have the means to convince her otherwise. And that’s exactly why I’m trying to get in touch with Titor. I square my shoulders, ready to meet her challenge head on.* "...Everything is the choice of Steins Gate! This is the power of my magic eye, Reading Steiner! Muhahaha!"

Kurisu: *She rolls her eyes at my theatrics.* "Aaaand he’s at it again."

Kurisu: *I watch as she sighs and goes back to her book.* "I’m not playing along with your games. I bet you came up with that Reading Whatever thing just now, didn’t you?"

Okabe: *Her words sting, and I clench my fists, frustration simmering in my chest. I should have known better than to approach Kurisu unprepared. There’s still not enough information, even for a mad scientist like me, to explain the things I’ve experienced. I bite my lip, fighting back a sigh.* "Hello?"

Itaru: "Okarin! I’ve made a terrible mistake!"

Okabe: *My heart races at Itaru's panicked voice.* "Mistake?"

Okabe: *Is it about the PhoneWave (name subject to change)? Is it related to the phenomenon I experienced earlier? I gulp. I know it’s pathetic for a mad scientist to show anxiety, but I can’t help it. I lick my dry lips and wait for Daru to speak.*

Itaru: "Actually... I left my wallet at the lab."

Okabe: *My heart sinks. All that worry for nothing.* "Wh...at?"

Itaru: "I can’t go to MayQueen like this! Can you bring me my wallet? I’ll buy you a drink."

Okabe: *I can't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all.* "Go jump in the river!"

Okabe: *I hang up, shaking my head. But right afterward, my phone rings again. I glance at the caller ID, and my frustration flares up again.* "Tch, persistent little..."

Okabe: "Yeah? I’m not delivering your wallet, okay!?"

Mayuri: "Tutturu♪ Okarin, Okarin!"

Okabe: *Hearing Mayuri's cheerful voice, I can't help but soften.* "Oh, it’s you. You’re with Daru, right? You don’t have to lend that dumbass any money, okay?"

Mayuri: "Um, okay♪ So, Okarin, I was wondering if you cheered up. Did you hug Upa like I said?"

Okabe: *I puff out my chest, putting on my best mad scientist voice.* "No! I am a mad scientist full of madness and ambition!"
