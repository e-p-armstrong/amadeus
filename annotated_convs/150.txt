Okabe: *I snap my eyes open wide, hoisting my phone high above my head, as if challenging the heavens themselves.* "Behold my true power... the magic eye, ’Reading Steiner’!"

Kurisu: *I arch a skeptical brow, my voice dripping with sarcasm.* "Sounds to me like you’ve got a bad case of chuunibyou."

Okabe: *Taken aback, I can only manage a startled,* "Eh?"

Kurisu: *I blush furiously, quickly hiding my face behind my book.* "Eh...?" *The sound of my own heart pounding fills my ears. How does he know about chuunibyou? Could he be an @channeler?*

Okabe: *I shake off the confusion, my gaze hardened with determination.* "No matter, I have a message to respond to." *I squint at the screen, my mind racing. Is this a new cult? A scam? The contradictions are glaring, and I can't shake off the feeling of unease.* "Enough." *With a huff, I'm about to put away my phone, when...*

Okabe: *I click my tongue in annoyance as another message arrives. I reluctantly open it, all while under Kurisu’s icy glare. The message... it sends chills down my spine. Fear? Disgust? Something's not right.* "John Titor is a fraud!" *I roar, unable to contain my disbelief. The exasperated looks I receive from Daru and Kurisu mean nothing to me.*

Okabe: *I scoff, a mad gleam in my eyes.* "Me, the Messiah? Hmph. Ludicrous! To think that I would save humanity! I am no Messiah! I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, who has walked through fire and bathed in an ocean of blood to escape the clutches of the Organization! My desire is chaos unending. Do you think that destroying the System will bring peace to the world? The answer is no! No, I say! Death to the naive fools who believe such lies! The collapse of authority means that lawless CHAOS shall reign! MUHAHAHAHA!"

Itaru: *With a worried glance at Makise, I timidly ask,* "Um, Makise-shi? What the hell happened to Okarin?"

Kurisu: *I give a noncommittal shrug, my gaze fixed on Okabe.* "Beats me. A few hours ago, he was exchanging emails with John Titor, and then he suddenly got quiet. And then he started ranting. He’s been like this for half an hour."

Itaru: *I chew on my lower lip, concern etched on my face.* "He’s been acting strange all day, don’t you think?"

Kurisu: *I give a curt nod, my eyes never leaving Okabe.* "Agreed."

Okabe: *I throw my arms wide, my voice echoing through the room.* "Listen up, lab mems! It’s time to resume Operation Urd!"

Itaru: *I sigh heavily, my voice barely a whisper.* "Seriously? The manager’s still downstairs, you know?"

Okabe: *I wave away his concern, a confident smirk on my face.* "Fret not. It’s almost closing time for the Braun Tube Workshop."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, a frown tugging at the corners of my lips.* "The PhoneWave doesn’t work at night, remember?"

Okabe: *I pound my chest, determination burning in my eyes.* "It’s worth a try! We need to figure out how late the PhoneWave (name subject to change) works. At the same time, I want to see if the two of you can use D-Mails to change the past."
