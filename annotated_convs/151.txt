Okabe: "You have one!?" *I turn to Suzuha, a hopeful look in my eyes.*

Suzuha: *She shakes her head, a look of regret on her face.* "I'm going to 1975 to obtain one."

Okabe: "Alright! We need to move fast. How soon can you leave, Suzuha?" *I ask, my voice filled with urgency.*

Suzuha: "I was trying to leave when you caught me, but..." *She bows her head apologetically, her injured hand hidden.*

Okabe: "Right... your time machine's broken." *I glance at her hand, my worry for her evident.*

Kurisu: "Can you fix it?" *She asks, turning towards Suzuha, her eyes focused on her.*

Suzuha: "No. I just ride it. My dad's the one who built it. I've memorized the manual, so I know how it works, but..." *Her voice trails off, a look of helplessness crossing her face.*

Kurisu: "Maybe we can use the Time Leap Machine to go back before Amane-san's time machine broke." *She suggests, her gaze steady.*

Itaru: "Wait, you're going to use the Time Leap Machine? Wasn't the plan not to experiment?" *He looks at me, confusion etched on his face.*

Okabe: "We'll use it if the situation demands. Do you know when it broke, Suzuha?" *I return his gaze briefly before focusing back on Suzuha.*

Suzuha: "No... but it was probably the rain a few days ago. It's supposed to be airtight, but the inside was all wet when I checked it today." *She explains, her voice filled with disappointment.*

Itaru: "Maybe it made a hole when you crashed into Radi-Kan?" *He asks, looking at Suzuha with curiosity.*

Suzuha: "That wasn't a crash. The coordinates were slightly off, so it just appeared there. It's not exactly the most stable machine." *She corrects him, a faint smile on her face.*

Okabe: "Anyone remember when it rained?" *I ask, looking at each of them in turn.*

Kurisu: "The morning of the 10th. Just before dawn." *She replies confidently, her memory serving her well.*
