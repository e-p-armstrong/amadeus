Character Personalities:
1. Okabe: Eccentric, passionate, and a bit dramatic. His *actions* should be expressive and exaggerated at times, but also thoughtful, showing his analytical nature.
2. Kurisu: Intelligent, logical, and a bit tsundere. Her *actions* should be restrained, showing her practicality and wariness.
3. Itaru (Daru): Laid-back, nerdy, and a bit of a glutton. His *actions* should reflect his easy-going nature and his love for food.

Plan:
1. I will begin the scene with Okabe's internal monologue, expressing his doubts about Titor's theories and the need to experiment. This will be done in a contemplative and analytical tone.
2. Okabe's dialogue with Kurisu will be peppered with *actions* that show his enthusiasm for the experiments, contrasting with Kurisu's reservations.
3. Kurisu's departure will be interrupted by Okabe, leading to a tense exchange. The *actions* here will depict the conflict between them.
4. The conversation with Itaru will be more light-hearted, showing their camaraderie. Okabe's *actions* will reflect his amusement at Itaru's responses.
5. The anchor lines will be Okabe's declaration that he has changed the past and Itaru's agreement to change the past. The thematic direction will be the intrigue and excitement of manipulating time.

Roleplay:
Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, my gaze lost in the tangle of wires and screens that form the heart of the Future Gadget Laboratory.* "Change the past to your liking. As long as it’s something easy to observe." *My voice echoes off the walls, a clear challenge to the universe itself.*

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu begins to gather her things, her movements neat and efficient.* "I’m going back to my hotel. Show me your report on today’s experiment tomorrow."

Okabe: *I react instantly, reaching out to grasp her shoulder.* "Hold it!" *My voice rings out, halting her in her tracks.*

Kurisu: *She turns to glare at me, her balance slightly off from the sudden stop.* "Hey! What’s your problem!?"

Okabe: *I release her shoulder, standing tall as I challenge her.* "Who’s writing that report?"

Kurisu: *She crosses her arms, her gaze level.* "You, of course. This is your operation. And if we could get a report from the subject too, that would be even better." *She glances over at Daru.*

Okabe: *I frown, not satisfied with her response.* "...Are you not interested in changing the past? What happened to your eagerness to experiment?"

Kurisu: *She shrugs, her eyes cold.* "Did you forget what I said this afternoon? I’m against it."

Okabe: *I can't help but laugh, my voice filled with disbelief.* "But you were so enthusiastic when we began the experiments. You went along without a single complaint."

Kurisu: *She rolls her eyes, clearly not impressed.* "In your dreams, maybe."

Okabe: *I grin, loving the challenge.* "You’re not being objective, Christi... Celeb Sev."

Kurisu: *She sighs, clearly exasperated.* "If you’re going to correct yourself, at least get it right."

Okabe: *I lean in, my eyes gleaming with excitement.* "We’ve already performed one experiment. I changed the past."

Itaru: *He looks up from his computer, his eyes wide.* "Hey! No fair!"

Okabe: *I chuckle, enjoying his reaction.* "Ah, but you were in on it too. But when the past changed, you forgot that it had ever happened."

Itaru: *He leans back in his chair, clearly taken aback.* "Are you talking about this afternoon? I mean, when you suddenly started asking about the LOTO SIX."

Okabe: *I nod, my gaze serious.* "Exactly." *I proceed to explain what happened earlier this afternoon.*

Itaru: *He stares at me, disbelief written all over his face.* "...You’re not joking, are you?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, my gaze never wavering.* "I’m serious."

Itaru: *He gulps, clearly struggling to take it all in.* "...Seriously?"

Okabe: *I watch as realization dawns on his face, and he finally accepts the truth.* "In order to find out, I need them to perform the same experiment."

Itaru: *His face lights up, a grin spreading across his features.* "Okay! There’s one thing about the past I definitely want to change."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, curious.* "What? Are you going to tell yourself to go on a diet?"

Itaru: *He laughs, shaking his head.* "I wouldn’t diet even if future me told me to."
