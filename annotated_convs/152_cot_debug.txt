Okabe: "Buy food. Lots of food. Use it all!" *I say, thrusting a 10,000 yen bill towards Itaru and Mayuri.*

Itaru: "You just calmly hand over a 10,000 yen bill... wow, Okarin, you make it look easy! That's why we love you! That's why we admire you!" *He exclaims, taking the bill with a wide grin, before leaving the room with Mayuri.*

Okabe: "Christina. Titor." *I say, turning my focus towards Kurisu and Suzuha.*

Suzuha: "Titor? Is that me?" *She asks, her eyebrows knitting together in confusion.*

Okabe: "Who else?" *I respond, shrugging my shoulders slightly.*

Suzuha: "Why are you calling me that now?" *She continues, looking at me with a puzzled expression.*

Okabe: "Because you're the one behind Titor's mask." *I clarify, meeting her gaze.*

Suzuha: "Well, yeah, but..." *She trails off, looking away.*

Kurisu: "Just give up. Okabe rarely calls anyone by their name." *She interjects, trying to soothe Suzuha's confusion.*

Suzuha: "Oh yeah. He always calls me 'Part-Time Warrior' for some reason." *She muses, a hint of amusement in her voice.*

Okabe: "Listen, you two. I'm going to leap to 2 PM on the 11th. After Titor explains herself again, we'll start repairs on the time machine. Our goal is to have it working by this time today." *I explain, my voice filled with determination.*

Kurisu: "Is that the best plan?" *She inquires, her eyes scanning my face for any signs of doubt.*

Okabe: "It's better than trying to fix it when we only have two hours left. If it doesn't work, I'll just keep repeating the same two days." *I reply, clenching my fists in resolve.*

Suzuha: "...I'm sorry." *She murmurs, her eyes downcast.*

Okabe: "Titor. We're counting on you to get us an IBN 5100. Never forget. I'm not doing this for you, and I'm not doing it for the future. My mission is to save Mayuri. Call me self-righteous if you want. However... I'm doing this my way." *I declare, holding their gazes.*

Kurisu: *She nods in agreement,* "Good. Then let's begin."

Okabe: *I nod back,* "You're not going to name the operation?" 

Kurisu: "You couldn't find a good Norse mythology-themed name?" *She teases, trying to lighten the mood a bit.*

Suzuha: "Why Norse mythology?" *She asks, looking at Kurisu with curiosity.*

Kurisu: "I don't think there's a deep meaning behind it. Chuunibyou patients just love Germanic names for some reason." *She explains, shrugging nonchalantly.*

Suzuha: "Now that you mention it, most of our operation names in the Resistance have Germanic names too. Whenever I ask, they say it's tradition." *She adds, a thoughtful look on her face.*

Kurisu: "So there's still chuunibyou in 2036..." *She concludes, a small smile playing on her lips.*
