Planning:

The scene involves a debate and a discussion around the concept of D-Mail and changing the past. The characters involved are Okabe, Itaru, and Kurisu, each having distinct personality traits. 

- Okabe: The eccentric, dramatic, and passionate protagonist. He's a self-proclaimed mad scientist who's deeply involved in the D-Mail experiment. His actions and thoughts will have elements of intensity, excitement, and a touch of madness.

- Itaru: Okabe's friend and a hardcore otaku. He's an expert hacker and has a light-hearted, humorous personality. His actions will reflect his jovial nature and excitement around the experiment.

- Kurisu: A genius neuroscientist who's more serious and rational compared to Okabe and Itaru. She's the voice of reason in this scene, expressing her concerns about changing the past. Her actions will be more composed, thoughtful, and stern.

Anchors: 
- Kurisu's line about not wanting to change any of her past memories, and her response to Okabe's question about experiments. These lines carry a lot of emotional weight and reveal Kurisu's personal beliefs and principles. They'll be embellished with more depth and emotions.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I lean forward, my fingers tapping impatiently on the table.* "You’re gonna change the result?"

Itaru: *I give a smug grin, my eyes gleaming with confidence.* "I remember every move Faris-tan made. It’ll be easy to take her from behind. Aren’t I a genius?"

Okabe: *A chuckle escapes my lips as I shake my head, skepticism creeping into my thoughts.* "Whatever. Daru, prepare to D-Mail!"

Itaru: *Pumping his fist in the air, Itaru lets out a triumphant cheer.* "Hell yeah! I’ll give it my best shot!"

Okabe: *I watch as Itaru hunches over, his fingers dancing across the keyboard with practiced ease. Meanwhile, I start inputting the forwarding address into the PhoneWave (name subject to change). The time on my watch reads 6:55 PM. The uncertainty of the PhoneWave's operation at this hour gnaws at my mind, but there's no turning back now.*

Kurisu: *Her voice breaks the silence, pulling me out of my thoughts.* "So why do you think you’re the only one who remembers?"

Okabe: *I turn to face her, my eyes narrowed, a smirk playing on my lips.* "You’re awfully persistent. I see why they call you The Zombie."

Kurisu: *She frowns, confusion etched on her face.* "I don’t follow."

Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, my smirk widening.* "Zombies never stop coming. They’re persistent."

Kurisu: *Her tone turns stern, her eyes boring into mine.* "Cut the jokes. I’m serious here."

Okabe: *Her glare sends a shiver down my spine. I swallow hard, trying to maintain my composure.* "I think that the key is who receives the D-Mail. Only the recipient himself is able to retain his memories. That would be my guess."

Kurisu: *She hums in response, her eyes reflecting deep contemplation.*

Okabe: *I glance at her, aware that my hypothesis doesn't explain everything. But for now, it's the best we've got.* "After Daru, you’ll send the next D-Mail. Think about what you want to write."

Kurisu: *She sits up straight, her voice firm and decisive.* "No."

Okabe: *Surprise flickers across my face.* "Scared?"

Kurisu: *She shakes her head, her gaze steady.* "That’s not it."

Okabe: *I lean in closer, my curiosity piqued.* "Then are you worried about time paradoxes?"

Kurisu: *She pauses for a moment, then sighs.* "Well, there’s that, but it’s more like a personal policy."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, intrigued by her response.* "A policy?"

Kurisu: *Her gaze drops to her hands, her voice barely a whisper.* "Changing the past feels like cheating. I may only have 18 years of life experience, but I don’t want to change any of those memories."

Okabe: *I study her for a moment, her words echoing in my head.* "I see. You’re perfect now, so you don’t want to change."

Kurisu: *She quickly looks up, her cheeks flushing.* "That’s not what I said... I don’t want to deny who I’ve been. Because even my failures are a part of who I am today."

Okabe: *I lean back, mulling over her words.* "Even if we solved all of the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s problems, you wouldn’t use it? Even if John Titor said you could use his time machine to travel to whatever time you wish, you wouldn’t use it? Even if a blue robot cat from the future were to jump out of your desk and give you a doorway to everywhere, you wouldn’t use it?"

Kurisu: *She nods, her resolve unwavering.* "I wouldn’t."

Okabe: *I let out a chuckle, my eyes twinkling with amusement.* "But you love experiments. Don’t you?"

Kurisu: *She stammers, her cheeks growing even redder.* "S-something wrong with that?"

Okabe: *I laugh heartily, my finger pointing at her.* "So basically, you like to experiment on other people while you watch and cackle at the results! You truly are a mad scientist!"

Kurisu: *Her eyes flash with annoyance.* "Why you--"

Itaru: *His voice interrupts our banter.* "Done!"
