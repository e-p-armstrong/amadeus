## Planning:
- Kurisu: The genius scientist, often appearing aloof, blunt, but is internally a kind-hearted person who's sometimes flustered. Her actions will reflect her intelligence and her hidden kindness. 
- Itaru: The laid-back, perverted hacker of the group. His actions will often show his casual nature, with a bit of his otaku side shining through.
- Okabe: The protagonist, eccentric, and self-proclaimed mad scientist. He is dramatic but at the same time very caring for his friends. His actions will convey his dramatic flair and his concern for his friends.

Anchors: 
1. Itaru's line about his defeat. This line can be embellished to show his disappointment and determination.
2. Kurisu's line about the experiment not being approved. This can be highlighted to show her conflicted feelings.

## Roleplay:
Kurisu: *I frown, my brows furrowing in confusion as I lean over the table to get a better look at the cards.* "I don’t get it."

Itaru: *I glance at Kurisu, then at the cards, a smug grin spreading on my face.* "It’s how Faris-tan placed her cards. Can’t you tell? You guys are lame."

Okabe: *Ignoring Itaru's comment, I focus on the task at hand, my fingers dancing on the keyboard as I prepare to send the D-Mail. The machine hums to life, the familiar discharge phenomenon filling the room. I shield my eyes from the bright sparks, waiting for the spectacle to subside. The D-Mail was sent. Yet, something seems off.* "Why do I remember?"

Itaru: *I turn my attention from the card game, looking around in confusion.* "Did the past change?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow at Itaru, surprise evident in my tone.* "Wait. Daru, you remember too?"

Itaru: *I blink in confusion, scratching the back of my head.* "Huh? Remember what?"

Okabe: *With a sigh, I lean back in my chair, crossing my arms over my chest.* "That you just sent a D-Mail!"

Kurisu: *I quickly catch on, nodding in understanding before Okabe even asks.* "Of course I remember. What are you... Oh, I see. According to your hypothesis, you and I shouldn’t remember sending the D-Mail."

Okabe: *I turn my gaze to Itaru, my eyes narrowing in thought.* "Daru, did you beat Faris in the Faris Cup?"

Itaru: *I shrug, my expression blank.* "...I dunno."

Okabe: *I press on, my words coming out in a rapid-fire as I try to understand what's happening.* "You said the winner gets Faris’s home cooking, right? Did you eat it? What happened?"

Itaru: *I shake my head, frustration creeping into my voice.* "I don’t know... This sucks."

Okabe: *I quickly check Daru’s send history, confirming my suspicion. The D-Mail isn't there, yet it's in his inbox, sent two days ago.* 

Kurisu: *I lean back in my chair, crossing my arms as I ponder the situation.* "...Maybe the past hasn’t changed?"

Itaru: *I quickly grab my phone, flipping it open and dialing a number.* "I’ll try calling Mayu-shi."

Okabe: *I watch Daru with furrowed brows, my mind whirling with possibilities. Why doesn't he remember the changed past?*

Itaru: "Mayu-shi? You’re still at work, right? Is Faris-tan there? ...She is!? Um, can you ask her if I beat her in the Faris Cup? Did I get to eat her home cooking? ...Who lost? I did? Oh... Barely took five seconds? Oh... okay..." *My voice trails off, my shoulders drooping as I hang up the phone. The disappointment is palpable, but so is the resolve to keep trying.*

Kurisu: *I let out a sigh, my eyes softening as I watch Itaru.* "I guess that means the past hasn’t changed."

Itaru: *I look up, my eyes blazing with determination despite the disappointment.* "Why!? It changed for Okarin, right!?"

Kurisu: *I pause, choosing my words carefully.* "Maybe your foolproof plan wasn’t so foolproof. Like, maybe it only gave you a slight advantage."

Okabe: *I nod in agreement, my hands clasped in thought.* "That might not be enough to cause worldline divergence."

Kurisu: *I quickly interject, my voice firm.* "Like Okabe said, you need to make a change that’s easier to observe. Or else there’s no point to this experiment. Um, n-not that I approve of this experiment or anything." *I quickly add, my cheeks slightly pink as I realize my unintended support.*

Itaru: *I sit up straight, my resolve unshaken.* "No, it’s not over yet. I can still fight!"
