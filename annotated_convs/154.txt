Itaru: *I take a deep breath, my fingers deftly typing out the message on the phone.* "One more time. I’ll try sending my past self some more advice. This time, something that’ll ensure my victory."

Kurisu: *I glance over at Itaru, a questioning tilt to my head.* "You really want to win that badly?"

Okabe: *I can't help but chuckle, shaking my head at Itaru's dedication.* "More like he wants to eat Faris’s home cooking that badly."

Itaru: *I look up from the phone, a determined glint in my eyes.* "That’s my Final Answer."

Okabe: *I watch as Itaru sends the D-Mail, not even bothering to check its contents. We activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change), the familiar whirring sound filling the room. Yet, nothing happens. No discharge, no shift in reality.* "Oh...?"

Kurisu: *I look at the timer, my brows furrowing in confusion.* "...Out of time?"

Okabe: *I shrug, the disappointment evident in my voice.* "Looks like it."

Itaru: *I slump in my chair, my previous excitement deflated.* "But my advice was perfect..."

Okabe: "There’s nothing we can do about it. We’ll postpone the experiment till tomorrow." *I glance at the clock, noting the time. Just past 7PM. It seems we've found our cutoff.*

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, my mind already racing with theories.* "After I left yesterday, I was thinking. How exactly does the PhoneWave make time travel possible?"

Okabe: "It works like the LHC. Didn’t you say the LHC was like a giant microwave?" *I respond, recalling our previous conversation.*

Kurisu: *I scoff at his simplification.* "If every microwave could turn into the LHC, then Japan would have black holes popping up everywhere."

Itaru: "Whoa, that sounds worse than earthquakes." *I say with a shudder, imagining the scenario.*

Kurisu: *I shake my head, attempting to bring the discussion back to a scientific level.* "I know it looks like SERN is able to create Kerr black holes willy-nilly, but that’s not supposed to be possible. You can’t just press a button and make a black hole. Even if you could, the risks would be unthinkable. It’s ridiculous to suggest that a household microwave could generate a black hole."

Okabe: *I think back to Titor’s claims about his time machine. But something in Kurisu's words makes me question those claims. I decide not to bring it up, for now.*

Kurisu: *I sigh, already feeling the fatigue of the day creeping in.* "My point is that there has to be something else going on here. Some outside source must be injecting electrons into this microwave."

Okabe: *An outside source of electrons... What could that be? I ponder her words, already forming new theories.*

Kurisu: *I stand up, stretching my stiff muscles.* "Well, I’m going back to my hotel. I’ve had enough of this filthy man cave. See you tomorrow. Don’t forget to write that report." *With that, I leave, leaving my lab coat behind.*

Itaru: "Hmm... Makise-shi’s lab coat... I wonder what it smells like..." *I say, reaching for the discarded coat.*

Okabe: *Seeing Itaru's actions, I grab him by the neck, pulling him away from the coat.* "Cut that out! If you have time to be perverted, then go think about how to change the past for tomorrow’s experiment!"
