Okabe: "P-precisely!" *I straighten my back, nodding in agreement with Suzuha's excuse.*

Itaru: "Fix it in two days? That's just nuts." *He raises his eyebrows in disbelief.*

Okabe: "But if you do, you'll earn the right to a date with Faris." *I say, trying to motivate him with a hopeful smile.*

Itaru: "...!?" *His eyes widen in surprise.*

Okabe: "Can you fix it?" *I ask, leaning in expectantly.*

Itaru: "No problem!" *He responds confidently, pumping his fist in determination.*

Okabe: *Sighing with relief, I turn to Suzuha.* "Great. Now I just need to figure out how I'm going to convince Faris..." *I mutter, rubbing my temples.*

Suzuha and I leave for our unsuccessful search. We return to the lab, hearts heavy with disappointment.

Kurisu: "Welcome back." *She emerges from the development room, her face revealing her curiosity about our day.*

Okabe: "Where's Daru?" *I ask, scanning the room.*

Kurisu: "He hasn't come back yet. It's already dark, so maybe he went straight home?" *She shrugs, looking a bit worried.*

Suzuha: "I feel bad. There's no time for this..." *She says, looking downcast.*

Okabe: "It's not for you. We're doing it to save Mayuri." *I reassure her, putting a comforting hand on her shoulder.*

Suzuha: "...Yeah." *She replies quietly, nodding in understanding.*

Okabe: *I sit down at Daru's computer to search for information on unique pins, determined to investigate further tomorrow.*

Next morning, I'm startled awake by a loud alarm.

Okabe: "Is it SERN!?" *I jump up, ready for a confrontation.*

Kurisu: "Good morning." *She greets, holding her phone, the source of the alarm.*

Okabe: "...You came to wake me up? Thanks." *I say, attempting to ease the tension.*

Kurisu: "I didn't do it for you." *She says coldly, turning her attention back to her phone.*

Suzuha: "I asked her to wake you up, Okabe Rintaro. There's something I want to show you." *She says, pointing to a strange object on the table.*

Okabe: "...What's this?" *I ask, looking at the device with curiosity.*

Suzuha: "A divergence meter. The numbers indicate the divergence value of the current worldline." *She explains.*

Okabe: "You made this?" *I ask, examining the Nixie tubes.*

Suzuha: "No. I brought it with me from 2036." *She states matter-of-factly.*

Okabe: "These are Nixie tubes, right? Whoever made this has taste. I'd happily dub it Future Gadget No. 9." *I say, clearly impressed.*

Kurisu: "How exactly does it work? It shouldn't be possible to measure changes like that." *She interjects, her curiosity piqued.*

Suzuha: "I don't know either." *She shrugs, looking just as puzzled as Kurisu.*

Okabe: "You don't know!?" *I exclaim, taken aback.*

Suzuha: "Can you guess who made it?" *She asks, a mischievous glint in her eyes.*

Okabe: "Huh?" *I respond, taken aback.*

Suzuha: "You did, Okabe Rintaro." *She reveals, watching my reaction.*

Okabe: "Huh..." *I say, shocked and speechless.*

Kurisu: "So this meter lets other people check worldline divergence?" *She asks, looking at the device with interest.*

Suzuha: "I wish. I'm pretty sure only Okabe Rintaro would notice if the number changed." *She says, shaking her head.*

Kurisu: "What? Then there's no point. Make something useful for once, Okabe." *She scoffs, crossing her arms in annoyance.*
