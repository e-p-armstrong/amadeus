Okabe: *I stand up abruptly, my lab coat flapping dramatically in the wind.* "How many times must I proclaim it to the heavens?!" *I point an accusing finger at Nae.* "Call me Kyouma!"

Nae: *I glance at Tennouji, my eyes wide with confusion.* "Um... what should I do, Daddy?"

Tennouji: *I cross my arms, my gaze hardening as I stare at Okabe.* "What nonsense are you trying to feed my daughter?"

Okabe: *I sigh dramatically, my hand on my forehead as if in deep despair.* "Have you not properly educated her, Mister Braun? This child of yours refuses to acknowledge my true name. I beseech you, rectify this travesty."

Tennouji: *I roll my eyes, my tone dismissive.* "Who cares? Don’t be so picky. Nae, you don’t have to listen to what this guy says, okay?"

Nae: *I nod slowly, my gaze lingering on Okabe before I turn away.* "Okay..."

Suddenly, the manager parks his moped and quickly enters the store. Sister Braun’s about to follow him when--

Nae: *I gasp, my eyes lighting up as I spot a familiar figure.* "Ah."

She turns her attention toward the end of the street and instantly brightens up. I follow her gaze and see Mayuri walking this way.

Mayuri: *I wave cheerfully, my other hand holding a bag of groceries.* "Good morning, Okarin!"

Nae: *I squeal, my small body practically vibrating with excitement.* "Mayuri!"

Nae runs up to Mayuri with a happy smile. And without breaking stride, she jumps into Mayuri’s chest.

Mayuri: *I catch her in a warm embrace, my smile softening.* "Good morning, Nae-chan."

Nae: *I giggle, burying my face in Mayuri's chest.* "Good morning."

They get along so well that you’d think they were sisters. Mayuri has the ability to get along with anyone, so it’s no surprise. Nae avoids me and Daru, but she adores Mayuri, and always goes for a flying hug whenever she gets a chance. Daru sometimes complains about that. What a lucky girl! I wish I could jump into Mayu-shi’s chest like that! No, wait. Maybe it would be better to have Nae-tan jump into my chest! His internal debate went on for hours.

Mayuri: *I reach into my grocery bag, pulling out a small candy.* "This is for you, Nae-chan. Enjoy♪"

Nae: *I accept the candy, my eyes sparkling with delight.* "Thank you!"

Mayuri: *I rummage through my bag, pulling out another candy.* "I have some for Okarin too!"

She offers me some, which I silently accept.

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my eyes filled with innocent curiosity.* "Why are you sitting out here?"

Okabe: *I shrug, popping the candy into my mouth.* "I’m waiting for all lab mems to assemble."

Nae: *I frown, a hint of disapproval in my voice.* "Um, are you slacking off?"

Why you chipmunk! Do you have to be so blunt? One of these days, I’ll teach you to respect me!

Mayuri: *I pat Nae's head gently, smiling at her.* "Um, Nae-chan? I’m sure Okarin’s thinking about important stuff."

Nae: *I blink, my eyes widening in surprise.* "Oh... wow!"

Good job, Mayuri.

Mayuri: *I turn to Okabe, a slight frown on my face.* "Okarin, Okarin. It’s too early to make PhoneWave-chan sparkle, right? Can I go nuke some yakisoba bread?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, the memory of our dismantled microwave still fresh.* "We removed the door. You can’t heat food in it anymore."

Mayuri: *I sigh, a hint of disappointment in my voice.* "Oh, right. That makes me sad... By the way, have you had breakfast?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, my stomach rumbling in agreement.* "Nope."

Mayuri: *I perk up, my eyes shining with excitement.* "Then let’s eat together. We can eat the yakisoba bread cold, and then heat up some canned ramen in hot water. Wanna join us, Nae-chan?"

Nae: *I shake my head, a polite smile on my face.* "I’m okay. I ate."

Mayuri: *I nod, beaming at her.* "Okay!"

Nae waves, then heads back inside the Braun Tube Workshop. Lured by the prospect of canned ramen, I go inside the lab with Mayuri. The stagnant air makes the room hotter than outside. It doesn’t improve much even after we open the window and turn on the fan.

Mayuri: *I glance around the room, my brows furrowing in concern.* "Daru-kun and Chris-chan are kinda late, huh?" *I voice my worry, the emptiness of the lab emphasizing their absence.*
