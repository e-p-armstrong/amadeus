Kurisu: "What? Don't apologize. It's creepy." *She gives Okabe a stern look, her brows furrowed.*

Okabe: "I know you're not a fan of time travel research. But here you are building a time machine." *I glance towards the work in progress, then back at Kurisu, concern lining my features.* "I was just worried that maybe you were feeling conflicted."

Kurisu: "How rude." *She scowls at my comment, crossing her arms over her chest.*

Kurisu: "I'm sure I've said this before, but I've always accepted time travel as a theory." *She sighs deeply, her gaze moving from me to the time machine.* "I just don't trust people who claim it can be done despite how unrealistic it is."

Kurisu: "Besides, I can hardly deny it with evidence staring me in the face." *She gestures towards the time machine with a resigned smile.* "Though I still don't like the idea of being called the mother of the time machine."

Suzuha: *She shrugs nonchalantly at Kurisu's words.*

Kurisu: "Anyway. If you're apologizing, that must mean you helped out the first time." *She turns back to me, her expression more relaxed now.*

Okabe: "The first time?" *I tilt my head, confused.*

Kurisu: "Before you started time leaping. You helped me build the machine, didn't you?" *She asks, her eyes searching mine for confirmation.*

Okabe: "Yeah. Daru and I helped." *I nod, recalling the past.*

Kurisu: "Then don't worry about it." *She gives me an assuring smile.* "I wouldn't want you to have to do it all over again. And right now, it's more important to repair Amane-san's time machine and search for her father."

Suzuha: "...Sorry." *She turns to us, her face apologetic.*

Kurisu: "Don't you apologize now. It's weird." *She waves a hand dismissively at Suzuha.* "Welp, back to work. I should be able to get a lot done now that I know about the lifter." *With a final nod at us, she turns back to the time machine.*
