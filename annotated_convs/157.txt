Okabe: *I watch as Daru leaves the room, his shoulders slumped in defeat. I can't help but sigh, the weight of our failed experiment heavy in the air.* "Mayuri, it’s time for you to change the past."

Mayuri: *I blink, my spoon halfway to my mouth, the surprise evident in my wide eyes.* "Eh? Me? Are you sure? But, um... what should I change?"

Okabe: *I can't help but chuckle at her innocence, her confusion making the situation slightly lighter.* "Let’s use that canned ramen."

Mayuri: *I look down at the half-eaten ramen in my hand, my eyes sparkling with newfound excitement.* "Oh, I know! I’ll make Luka-kun wear one of my costumes!"

Okabe: *I shake my head, amused at her enthusiasm but wanting to keep things simple.* "Can’t you think of anything easier to change and observe?"

Mayuri: *I pout, but after a moment of thought, a bright smile lights up my face.* "Oh, that might work! When I went to the vending machine today, I spent ten minutes wondering if I should get canned oden or canned ramen. It was really hard!"

Okabe: *I nod, a small grin tugging at the corners of my mouth.* "So a little push should be enough to make you choose canned oden! Alright, let’s go with that!"

Mayuri: "Okay! But before we change the past, I gotta finish this ramen first." *I start shoveling the ramen into my mouth with renewed vigor, not wanting to waste any time.*

Kurisu: *I watch Mayuri's antics with a bemused smile, my skepticism replaced with a strange sense of anticipation.* "What happens if you don’t finish it?"

Mayuri: *I giggle, slurping up another spoonful of ramen.* "It’ll go to waste♪"

Okabe: *I shake my head, used to her antics by now. I turn to the PhoneWave, my fingers moving with practiced ease as I prepare it for another D-Mail.* "PhoneWave (name subject to change), activate!"

Mayuri: "Aw... I haven’t sent it yet..." *I pout, looking down at the unfinished mail in my hand.*

Kurisu: "So one second isn’t enough for the discharge to occur. That’s what I expected, but it’s good to have proof." *I fold my arms, a thoughtful frown on my face.*

Itaru: *From the corner of the room, I look up from my laptop, my voice echoing in the silent room.* "What if you try warming it up beforehand?"
