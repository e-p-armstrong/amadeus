Roleplay:

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, my fingers drumming a rhythm on the table as I formulate my hypothesis.* "One second isn’t enough, right? So just run the microwave for about 30 seconds without sending a mail. As soon as it’s done, run it again with the timer set at one second. That should cause the discharge, right?"

Kurisu: *I squint, my eyebrows furrowing in a mixture of skepticism and curiosity.* "Any basis for that?"

Itaru: *I shrug, a smug grin playing on my lips.* "Nope."

Okabe: *I clench my fists, frustration seeping into my voice.* "Damn. Mayuri, got anything else!?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my fingers playing with the hem of my dress as I think.* "Um, well... we could change the flavor of rice ball I bought last night..."

Okabe: *I run a hand through my hair, trying to piece together her idea.* "Do you remember what kind of rice ball you ate last night?"

Mayuri: *I nod, a small smile on my face as I recall the memory.* "Smoked tuna."

Kurisu: *I blink in surprise, my mouth slightly open as I utter in disbelief.* "She remembers!?"

Okabe: *My eyebrows shoot up, a sense of admiration seeping into my thoughts.* Impressive.

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes sparkling with excitement.* "So let’s change that to, um... fish eggs!"

Okabe: *I sigh, my gaze drifting towards the window as a sense of uncertainty fills me.* Maybe we should find another test subject. Something is telling me we’re going to have to look outside the lab. *I stand up, adjusting my lab coat as I head towards the door.* I go for a walk to clear my head. After lunch at King Burger, I grab a coffee at the Starbecks on the first floor of Yodobashi. I left Mayuri and the others at the lab. I need some time to get my thoughts in order. *I sit down, my fingers tracing the rim of the coffee cup as I dive deep into my thoughts.* I recall what happened when I sent myself the LOTO SIX numbers...

Okabe: *I'm pulled out of my musings by the incessant buzzing of my phone. Annoyance creeps into my thoughts as I glance at the screen.* "What?" *My eyes widen in surprise as I read the message.* She wants to send a D-Mail? That reminds me. Yesterday, I made Moeka Lab Mem 005. That means she’s qualified to participate in our experiments. Moeka seems serious, so she might meet my demands. Most importantly, all the other lab mems are completely useless when it comes to D-Mails. *I lean back in my chair, my mind racing as I weigh my options.* I still haven’t been able to verify whether or not I can keep my memories if someone else changes the past. *I narrow my eyes, a determined expression on my face.* "But wait..."
