Okabe: *I glance around the room, trying to figure out who Mayuri could be referring to.* 

Mayuri: "Allow me to introduce you! Suzu-san's dad is... Drrrrrrrrrrrr..."

Itaru: "Is that a drum roll!?" *He asks, a hopeful grin spreading across his face.*

Mayuri: "Tada! Suzu-san's dad is..." *She pauses for a moment, grinning widely at Suzuha, then* "Daru-kun!"

Kurisu: *My surprise must be evident on my face, as I stammer,* "That joke's not even logical. It's impossible for this perv to get married in the first place."

Itaru: "Hey... that kind of hurts." *He says, his voice filled with mock hurt.*

Okabe: "I completely agree with Christina. Daru is fated to become a wizard when he turns thirty." *I add, laughing along with Kurisu.*

Itaru: "You could be nicer about it, guys... but it's the truth, so I can't object." *He admits, falling to his hands and knees in mock despair.*

Suzuha: "Um... you know... my dad wasn't fat." *She chimes in, looking uncomfortable with the conversation.*

Mayuri: "Geez. You're all so mean to Daru-kun."

Itaru: "Mayu-shi's the only one to stand up for me. You're an angel, Mayu-shi. Do you love me?"

Mayuri: "Nope." *She replies without missing a beat, causing everyone to burst into laughter.*

Mayuri: "Um, Mayushii's one hundred million percent sure that Daru-kun is Suzuha's dad."

Kurisu: "Okay. What's your proof?" *I ask, curious to see how she could possibly back up such a ridiculous claim.*

Mayuri: "Um, I was thinking about the letters on Suzu-san's pin... After staring at it really hard, I noticed the 7 in '7010' looked a little weird. It's not a 7, it's a 2. The line fell off the bottom."

Suzuha: "R-really?" *She asks, staring at the pin in question.*

Mayuri: "It's easy to see on the picture we took!"

Kurisu: "2010? But that's this year!" *I exclaim, my amusement fading as I realize the implication of Mayuri's conclusion.*
