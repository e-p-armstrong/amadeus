Plan:

Okabe Rintarou: Protagonist, a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He’s a bit eccentric and dramatic, but deeply cares for his friends. His actions and thoughts should reflect his eccentricity and his strong sense of responsibility. He's a bit theatrical, so his actions will be exaggerated and expressive.

Makise Kurisu: A brilliant scientist, serious, and a bit tsundere. She's intelligent and analytical, her actions should be precise and calculated. She's a bit defensive, so her actions may come off as cold or aloof.

Shiina Mayuri: Okabe's childhood friend, sweet, innocent, and a bit airheaded. She's gentle and caring, her actions should reflect her warm and nurturing personality. She's a bit naive, so her actions will be simple and earnest.

Hashida Itaru (Daru): Okabe's best friend, a hardcore otaku. He's laid back and often makes inappropriate jokes. His actions should be relaxed and casual. He's a bit of a pervert, so his actions may come off as lewd or humorous.

Kiryu Moeka: A quiet, socially awkward woman with an obsession with her phone. She's very shy and withdrawn, her actions should be timid and reserved. She's a bit mysterious, so her actions will be elusive and vague.

The anchor lines will be Okabe’s "My request is that its contents be simple and easy to measure, so that we can confirm whether or not the past changes." and Kurisu’s "Experiments prioritize data over privacy in the first place. If you’re going to be a test subject, you need to be prepared for that.". These lines will encapsulate the themes of sacrifice and responsibility in the pursuit of scientific discovery.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *A sense of resolve takes over me as I type a reply to Moeka's mail. I press the send button with a sense of finality, then quickly make my way back to the lab, my mind filled with thoughts of the task at hand.* 

Upon my arrival, I find Moeka crouched at the bottom of the staircase, her attention fixed on her phone. *As she notices my approach, she slowly rises to her feet, her gaze still fixated on the glowing screen.* 

Moeka: "...Thank you." *She murmurs, her voice barely above a whisper.*

Okabe: *I tilt my head to the side in a bit of confusion.* "For what? I don’t think you’re selfish. In fact, I’m grateful for your offer."

Upon entering the lab, I gather all the lab mems, commanding their attention with a wave of my hand. *I then proceed to explain Moeka’s situation, my voice steady and firm.*

Mayuri: *Her eyes shine with understanding and acceptance.* "I think it’s a good idea! Moeka-san is a lab mem too!"

As I glance around the room, I notice that neither Daru nor Kurisu voice any objections. 

Itaru: *He leans back in his chair, a curious expression on his face.* "So, what sorta mail does Kiryu-shi plan to send?"

Okabe: *I cross my arms over my chest, putting on a serious expression.* "My request is that its contents be simple and easy to measure, so that we can confirm whether or not the past changes."

I can't help but wonder why she insists on explaining everything via mail. *I shake my head, pushing the thought aside for the moment.*

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow at her.* "A secret? What do you mean?"

Kurisu: *She steps forward, concern evident in her eyes.* "What’s going on?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, dismissing her concern.* "No, that’s not the problem."

Kurisu: *She leans over to peek at my phone, her eyes scanning the screen quickly.* "Hmmm, I see. I understand how you feel, but since this is an experiment, data collection should take priority."

Okabe: "Oh? We agree for once, assistant."

Kurisu: *She folds her arms across her chest, her cheeks flushing slightly.* "I-I’m not agreeing with you, exactly. If we don’t collect data, then we’ll never figure out how the PhoneWave works."

Mayuri: *She looks at me with a stern expression, her hands on her hips.* "But girls have lots of secrets, you know? You shouldn’t ask her to tell her secrets, Okarin. That’s perverted!"

Itaru: *He jumps up from his chair, a look of shock on his face.* "Whoa! Is that where we’re going with this!?"

Okabe: "Calm down, Daru!" *I command, waving my hand dismissively.*

I then turn to face Mayuri and Moeka, who appear to have formed some sort of alliance.

Okabe: *I hold my hands out in front of me in a placating gesture.* "We’re not asking you to send something private."

Kurisu: *She nods firmly at my words, showing her agreement.* "Even if you want to send something private, you shouldn’t for now. We still don’t know how this thing handles paradoxes, so we need to be extremely careful."

Moeka: "...Nothing private?" *She asks, her voice filled with uncertainty.*

Kurisu: *She shakes her head, her gaze steady.* "Nothing you want to keep secret, at least. Even if you mean well, the mail’s content might have a serious effect on the timeline. You should show your mail to a third party and have them check if the content is problematic or not."

Okabe: "Indeed. My assistant said everything I wanted to say. I will add only that the experiment must go on!"

Kurisu: "...I wasn’t speaking for you. Don’t misunderstand." *She says, her tone icy.*

Kurisu: *She then turns to face Moeka, her expression softening slightly.* "Experiments prioritize data over privacy in the first place. If you’re going to be a test subject, you need to be prepared for that."
