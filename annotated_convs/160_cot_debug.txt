Daru: *His words hang in the air, causing me to startle.* "Well, Mayushii's a lab mem, but I can't make time machines, and I don't like fighting. Of course I'm not famous!"

Mayuri: *She hums thoughtfully, shaking her head.* "But Daru-kun's a super hacka and Okarin's right arm. He even helped Okarin make PhoneWave-chan. So I thought it was strange Suzu-san didn't know him."

Kurisu: *She nods, considering Mayuri's words.* "So you're saying he used a different name?"

Mayuri: *She starts listing her points on her fingers.* "Barrel Titor-san helped Okarin found the Resistance, right? And he was in Akiba in 2010. And he was able to build his own time machine. And he knew about Okarin's Reading Spaghetti--"

Okabe: *I correct her, keeping my voice gentle.* "Reading Steiner."

Mayuri: *She nods in agreement.* "He knew about it. Doesn't that fit Daru-kun perfectly?"

Kurisu: *She leans back, considering Mayuri's theory.* "She's right."
