Okabe: *My heart pounding in my chest, I raise my voice, an edge of hysteria creeping in.* "Kiryu Moeka!" 

Itaru and Kurisu: *They exchange confused glances, their brows furrowing in puzzlement at my outburst.*

Itaru: *He scratches his head, his eyes wide with genuine confusion.* "Who's that?"

Kurisu: *She crosses her arms, her eyes narrowing as she tries to recall.* "Never heard of her."

Okabe: *I feel the color drain from my face, a cold shiver running down my spine.* "...No way."

Okabe: *A wave of dread washes over me as I grapple with the horrifying possibility.* So I did erase Moeka’s existence... No... that can’t be. I won’t accept that I killed her!

Kurisu: *She tilts her head, her gaze piercing, concerned.* "Did it happen again, Okabe?"

Okabe: *I blink, struggling to keep the panic from my voice.* "What do you mean, 'again'?"

Kurisu: *She taps her chin thoughtfully, her eyes narrowing.* "Something like this happened yesterday. You remembered something we didn’t. Uh, what did you call it? Oh yeah, Reading Steiner."

Okabe: *I nod slowly, my mind racing as I recall the term.* Yes, that’s the name I gave this phenomenon -- or rather, to my ability to perceive it. When the worldline changes, everyone’s memories are reconstructed to match. That’s what John Titor said. But somehow, I alone retain my memories even after the past changes. I named this power Reading Steiner. Kurisu remembered. To tell the truth, I just made it up out of thin air. But now that Moeka has disappeared, I want to believe that this power is real. It’s only their memories of Moeka that disappeared! Not Moeka herself! I need to contact Moeka. I need to make sure I didn’t erase her very existence. But I don’t know her phone number. The only way to contact her is by mail. I send her a message saying Reply the second you read this email. Now all I can do is wait for her reply. Please, reply...

Mayuri: *She steps closer, her eyes filled with worry.* "Are you okay? You’re really pale."

Okabe: *I attempt a weak smile, my voice trembling slightly.* "Y-yeah... I’m fine."

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest as I grapple with the terrifying possibility.* In fact, I’m anything but fine. I’m fighting desperately to deny the possibility that I might have erased Moeka from existence.

Okabe: *I turn to Kurisu, my gaze pleading.* "...Assistant, how much do you remember about the experiment we just did?"

Kurisu: *She raises an eyebrow, her tone matter-of-fact.* "I don’t remember doing any experiments today. You sent a D-Mail just now, didn’t you?"

Okabe: *I nod slowly, my stomach churning with dread.* "...Yeah. But things are different from yesterday. I didn’t send the D-Mail. Kiryu Moeka did."
