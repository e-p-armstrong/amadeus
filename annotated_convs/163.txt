Kurisu: *I cross my arms, leaning back against the wall, my brow furrowing as I ponder.* "...I don’t know. No one has experienced a time paradox, after all."

Okabe: *I tilt my head, my gaze intense as I probe her for answers.* "But before, didn’t you say something like the world would disappear?"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, correcting him.* "All I said was that that was one theory. Maybe nothing happens, and like in a certain movie, history gets amended to accommodate the paradox. According to Dr. Hawking’s chronology protection conjecture, it’s impossible to do anything that might cause a time paradox in the first place."

Okabe: *I sigh, rubbing my temples.* So all we have are theories...

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my brows furrowed in confusion.* "Um, Mayushii doesn’t really understand... But we’re all fine now, right? I don’t think that paradox thing happened. Mayushii doesn’t know who Moeka-san is, but I’m sure she’s okay too♪"

Itaru: *I chuckle, nudging Mayuri with my elbow.* "That’s Mayu-shi for you. A cute dumb girl."

Mayuri: *I pout, placing my hands on my hips.* "Ehh? Mayushii’s not dumb!"

Okabe: *I glance at Mayuri and Daru, my heart aching at their carefree banter. I can't help but feel a pang of envy, wishing I could share their blissful ignorance. My fists clench involuntarily as I grapple with the terrifying possibility that I may have erased someone's existence. I shudder, shaking the thought from my mind.*

Okabe: *My heart leaps as I hear the familiar sound of an incoming mail. With a trembling hand, I pull out my phone, my eyes scanning the screen eagerly.* "...!"

Okabe: *I slump against the wall, letting out a shaky laugh.* "...Ha, haha."

Okabe: *I wipe away the tears welling in my eyes, relief washing over me like a wave. I'm not a murderer. I didn't erase her. She's still here. Moeka's still here.*

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow at Okabe's reaction, curiosity piqued.* "Explain what happened, Okabe."

Okabe: *Prompted by Kurisu, I recount the events, my voice shaking with residual fear.*

Kurisu: *I nod, stroking my chin thoughtfully.* "Hmmm. ...Honestly, I’m not surprised she disappeared from the lab."

Okabe: *I raise my gaze to meet hers, my brow furrowing in confusion.* "What do you mean?"

Kurisu: *I shrug, my gaze distant as I speculate.* "I don’t know the details, but when the past changed, Kiryu-san’s actions these past four days changed ever so slightly. As a result, the timeline was reconfigured so that Moeka-san didn’t come to the lab today."

Okabe: *So that's why it seemed like she teleported. It wasn't like the gelbana... Moeka didn't turn into a jellyman.*

Itaru: *I scratch my head, struggling to wrap my mind around the concept.* "Is that even possible?"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, uncertainty clouding my features.* "I don’t know. If the fact that the D-Mail was sent is undone, then it becomes a paradox of who sent that D-Mail... And there’s one other thing that I don’t understand."

Okabe: *I lean forward, eager for her insight.* "What?"

Kurisu: *I scoff, rolling my eyes at his theatrics.* "What you call Reading Steiner. By the way, you should quit it with that name. It’s stupid."

Okabe: *I cross my arms, my lips curling into a smirk.* "Hmph, I didn’t ask for your opinion."
