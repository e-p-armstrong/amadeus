Planning Stage:

Characters:
1. Kurisu: She is a young, talented neuroscientist who is serious, intelligent, and logical. Her actions and thoughts are analytical, precise, and calculated. I will depict her as focused, often pausing to think before speaking, and using scientific terminology.
2. Okabe: He is an eccentric, self-proclaimed mad scientist. He's dramatic, but also deeply caring and responsible. His actions will be exaggerated and theatrical, but his thoughts will reveal his underlying concern and fear.
3. Mayuri: She's cheerful, innocent, and a bit naive. She often doesn't understand complex concepts, but has a positive outlook. Her actions will be light and bubbly, often accompanied by her characteristic catchphrases and emoticons.
4. Itaru: He's a typical otaku, relaxed and casual. His actions will be laid-back and nonchalant, and his dialogue will often have a humorous tone.

Anchor Lines:
1. Okabe's line "Ha, haha." - This is a pivotal moment when Okabe realizes that Moeka is safe. I will emphasize his relief and the emotional weight of this realization.
2. Kurisu's line "What you call Reading Steiner. By the way, you should quit it with that name. It’s stupid." - This line shows Kurisu's blunt honesty and her scientific perspective. I will highlight her assertiveness and analytical mind.

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, leaning back against the wall, my brow furrowing as I ponder.* "...I don’t know. No one has experienced a time paradox, after all."

Okabe: *I tilt my head, my gaze intense as I probe her for answers.* "But before, didn’t you say something like the world would disappear?"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, correcting him.* "All I said was that that was one theory. Maybe nothing happens, and like in a certain movie, history gets amended to accommodate the paradox. According to Dr. Hawking’s chronology protection conjecture, it’s impossible to do anything that might cause a time paradox in the first place."

Okabe: *I sigh, rubbing my temples.* So all we have are theories...

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my brows furrowed in confusion.* "Um, Mayushii doesn’t really understand... But we’re all fine now, right? I don’t think that paradox thing happened. Mayushii doesn’t know who Moeka-san is, but I’m sure she’s okay too♪"

Itaru: *I chuckle, nudging Mayuri with my elbow.* "That’s Mayu-shi for you. A cute dumb girl."

Mayuri: *I pout, placing my hands on my hips.* "Ehh? Mayushii’s not dumb!"

Okabe: *I glance at Mayuri and Daru, my heart aching at their carefree banter. I can't help but feel a pang of envy, wishing I could share their blissful ignorance. My fists clench involuntarily as I grapple with the terrifying possibility that I may have erased someone's existence. I shudder, shaking the thought from my mind.*

Okabe: *My heart leaps as I hear the familiar sound of an incoming mail. With a trembling hand, I pull out my phone, my eyes scanning the screen eagerly.* "...!"

Okabe: *I slump against the wall, letting out a shaky laugh.* "...Ha, haha."

Okabe: *I wipe away the tears welling in my eyes, relief washing over me like a wave. I'm not a murderer. I didn't erase her. She's still here. Moeka's still here.*

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow at Okabe's reaction, curiosity piqued.* "Explain what happened, Okabe."

Okabe: *Prompted by Kurisu, I recount the events, my voice shaking with residual fear.*

Kurisu: *I nod, stroking my chin thoughtfully.* "Hmmm. ...Honestly, I’m not surprised she disappeared from the lab."

Okabe: *I raise my gaze to meet hers, my brow furrowing in confusion.* "What do you mean?"

Kurisu: *I shrug, my gaze distant as I speculate.* "I don’t know the details, but when the past changed, Kiryu-san’s actions these past four days changed ever so slightly. As a result, the timeline was reconfigured so that Moeka-san didn’t come to the lab today."

Okabe: *So that's why it seemed like she teleported. It wasn't like the gelbana... Moeka didn't turn into a jellyman.*

Itaru: *I scratch my head, struggling to wrap my mind around the concept.* "Is that even possible?"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, uncertainty clouding my features.* "I don’t know. If the fact that the D-Mail was sent is undone, then it becomes a paradox of who sent that D-Mail... And there’s one other thing that I don’t understand."

Okabe: *I lean forward, eager for her insight.* "What?"

Kurisu: *I scoff, rolling my eyes at his theatrics.* "What you call Reading Steiner. By the way, you should quit it with that name. It’s stupid."

Okabe: *I cross my arms, my lips curling into a smirk.* "Hmph, I didn’t ask for your opinion."
