Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, a smug grin spreading across my face.* "Like an imaginary girlfriend. I get it."

Okabe: *I point an accusing finger at Itaru, my face twisted into a mock scowl.* "No you don’t. I’m not a ’gentleman perv’ like you, creating imaginary relationships."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, narrowing my eyes in thought.* "Maybe this Kiryu-san never existed. Or maybe Kiryu-san does exist, but the fact that she sent a D-Mail was something you made--"

Okabe: *I cut her off with a loud cry, dropping to my knees.* "Gwaaaah!"

Kurisu: *I take a step back, my eyes wide in surprise.* "...eh?"

Okabe: *I press my hand against my left eye, grimacing in pain.* "Ugh, ggh... my left eye, Reading Steiner, it aches!"

Mayuri: *I rush towards Okabe, my hands fluttering anxiously.* "Okarin, are you okay?"

Okabe: *I lightly push her aside, trying to put on a brave face.* "No, Mayuri! S-stay away! I don’t... want to hurt you!"

Mayuri: *I wring my hands together, looking at Okabe with concern.* "But Okarin, you look like you’re in pain..."

Itaru: *I glance over at Kurisu, raising an eyebrow skeptically.* "...He’s messing with us, right?"

Kurisu: *I shrug, looking away uncomfortably.* "Y-yeah..."

Okabe: *I clutch my chest, taking slow, deep breaths.* "I-I’m okay... This aching is normal... it’ll end soon! As long as I have this magic eye... the Organization will keep coming after me! It’s the power to see across time and space... but at the same time, it’s a double-edged sword! Because of this all-seeing eye... I have lost my connection to causality. I drift alone in the space between worlds. But even so... I swore to protect this lab! So quiet thy fury, Reading Steiner! Your time will come... but not yet."

Okabe: *I kneel and press my forehead against the cold floor, trying to steady my breathing. Slowly, I remove my hand from my left eye, the pain gradually subsiding.* 

Mayuri: *I sit next to Okabe, gently rubbing his back.* "Okarin? Does it hurt?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, slowly standing up.* "No... I’m okay now."

Okabe: *I shoot Kurisu a sharp glare, my resolve firm.* "You are wrong, Christina. Our experiments have already proven... That I... That my Reading Steiner is genuine!"

Kurisu: *I throw up my hands in exasperation, rolling my eyes.* "Fine, I get it. You’re a chuunibyou patient."

Itaru: *I tilt my head, raising an eyebrow in confusion.* "Eh?"

Mayuri: *I blink in confusion, tilting my head to the side.* "Hm?"

Kurisu: *I blush, looking away in embarrassment.* "Ah... Wh-why are you all staring at me? Don’t look at me!"

Okabe: *I sit on the bench in front of the Braun Tube Workshop, staring into the night sky. The confusion and fear from the afternoon's events still linger in my mind.* 

Okabe: *I look up as I hear footsteps approaching. Mayuri and Kurisu emerge from the second floor.* "Going home?"

Mayuri: *I nod, smiling at Okabe.* "Yup."

Kurisu: *I glance at Okabe, raising an eyebrow.* "Do you always stay the night here?"

Okabe: *I chuckle, leaning back on the bench.* "Pretty much. I wouldn’t be a true mad scientist if I couldn’t stay overnight at my lab, immersed in research."

Kurisu: *I shake my head, a small smile playing on my lips.* "I think you’re putting too much emphasis on appearances."

Mayuri: *I nod in agreement, a dreamy look in my eyes.* "But you know, this place is really convenient. Mayushii would stay over if mom and dad let me."
