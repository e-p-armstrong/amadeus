Suzuha: *Her written words echo in the silence of the room.* "The date is June 14th, the year 2000. About nine or ten years before you will read this. I failed...I only remembered who I was one year ago today...I failed...I failed...I failed..."

Okabe: *My hands curl, crumpling the page, and I realize that I am crying.* "Suzuha failed? She lost her memory? Her life... was meaningless?"

Suzuha: "That's all I want. I promised Dad. This was his dream. I want to change the future. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My life was meaningless."

Okabe: *Turning to Daru, my voice quivers with anger and disbelief.* "Daru... didn't you fix the time machine?"

Itaru: *He stammers, his face pale, clearly taken aback by Okabe's question.* "I... I did... I thought I did... but I mean, that was my first time repairing a time machine. I might have missed something."

Okabe: *I lash out, my words like daggers.* "Missed something!? Whatever you missed cost your daughter 24 years of her life!"

Itaru: "I didn't do it on purpose!" *He defends himself, his voice barely a whisper.*

Kurisu: *Stepping forward, her voice steady and calm.* "Calm down, both of you. Hashida did everything he could. He doesn't deserve your anger, Okabe."

Okabe: *I whirl around, my anger now directed at Kurisu.* "How can you be so calm!?"

Kurisu: "That's how I am. Sorry. Now calm down." *She stands her ground, her eyes holding mine, unyielding.*
