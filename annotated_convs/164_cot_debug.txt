Brainstorming and Planning:

Characters:
- Itaru: A talented hacker who enjoys his otaku hobbies. He often makes sarcastic remarks and brings comic relief to tense situations. His actions and thoughts would reflect his laid-back and slightly self-deprecating personality.
- Okabe: The main protagonist who often acts out his mad scientist persona, "Hououin Kyouma". He is eccentric, dramatic, and often adds flair to his actions and dialogue. His actions would be elaborate and expressive.
- Kurisu: A genius scientist who is generally serious and often acts as the voice of reason. Her actions would be more reserved and analytical.
- Mayuri: A sweet, air-headed girl who deeply cares for her friends. Her actions would be caring, gentle, and often show her naïve, innocent nature.

Anchor Lines:
1. Okabe: "No, Mayuri! S-stay away! I don’t... want to hurt you!" - Here, Okabe's concern for Mayuri's safety would be highlighted. His genuine care for her would be expressed through his actions and thoughts.
2. Okabe: "I-I’m okay... This aching is normal... it’ll end soon! As long as I have this magic eye... the Organization will keep coming after me! It’s the power to see across time and space... but at the same time, it’s a double-edged sword! Because of this all-seeing eye... I have lost my connection to causality. I drift alone in the space between worlds. But even so... I swore to protect this lab! So quiet thy fury, Reading Steiner! Your time will come... but not yet." - This line showcases Okabe's internal struggle and determination. His commitment to his role as a "mad scientist" and protector of the lab would be emphasized.

Roleplay:

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, a smug grin spreading across my face.* "Like an imaginary girlfriend. I get it."

Okabe: *I point an accusing finger at Itaru, my face twisted into a mock scowl.* "No you don’t. I’m not a ’gentleman perv’ like you, creating imaginary relationships."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, narrowing my eyes in thought.* "Maybe this Kiryu-san never existed. Or maybe Kiryu-san does exist, but the fact that she sent a D-Mail was something you made--"

Okabe: *I cut her off with a loud cry, dropping to my knees.* "Gwaaaah!"

Kurisu: *I take a step back, my eyes wide in surprise.* "...eh?"

Okabe: *I press my hand against my left eye, grimacing in pain.* "Ugh, ggh... my left eye, Reading Steiner, it aches!"

Mayuri: *I rush towards Okabe, my hands fluttering anxiously.* "Okarin, are you okay?"

Okabe: *I lightly push her aside, trying to put on a brave face.* "No, Mayuri! S-stay away! I don’t... want to hurt you!"

Mayuri: *I wring my hands together, looking at Okabe with concern.* "But Okarin, you look like you’re in pain..."

Itaru: *I glance over at Kurisu, raising an eyebrow skeptically.* "...He’s messing with us, right?"

Kurisu: *I shrug, looking away uncomfortably.* "Y-yeah..."

Okabe: *I clutch my chest, taking slow, deep breaths.* "I-I’m okay... This aching is normal... it’ll end soon! As long as I have this magic eye... the Organization will keep coming after me! It’s the power to see across time and space... but at the same time, it’s a double-edged sword! Because of this all-seeing eye... I have lost my connection to causality. I drift alone in the space between worlds. But even so... I swore to protect this lab! So quiet thy fury, Reading Steiner! Your time will come... but not yet."

Okabe: *I kneel and press my forehead against the cold floor, trying to steady my breathing. Slowly, I remove my hand from my left eye, the pain gradually subsiding.* 

Mayuri: *I sit next to Okabe, gently rubbing his back.* "Okarin? Does it hurt?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, slowly standing up.* "No... I’m okay now."

Okabe: *I shoot Kurisu a sharp glare, my resolve firm.* "You are wrong, Christina. Our experiments have already proven... That I... That my Reading Steiner is genuine!"

Kurisu: *I throw up my hands in exasperation, rolling my eyes.* "Fine, I get it. You’re a chuunibyou patient."

Itaru: *I tilt my head, raising an eyebrow in confusion.* "Eh?"

Mayuri: *I blink in confusion, tilting my head to the side.* "Hm?"

Kurisu: *I blush, looking away in embarrassment.* "Ah... Wh-why are you all staring at me? Don’t look at me!"

Okabe: *I sit on the bench in front of the Braun Tube Workshop, staring into the night sky. The confusion and fear from the afternoon's events still linger in my mind.* 

Okabe: *I look up as I hear footsteps approaching. Mayuri and Kurisu emerge from the second floor.* "Going home?"

Mayuri: *I nod, smiling at Okabe.* "Yup."

Kurisu: *I glance at Okabe, raising an eyebrow.* "Do you always stay the night here?"

Okabe: *I chuckle, leaning back on the bench.* "Pretty much. I wouldn’t be a true mad scientist if I couldn’t stay overnight at my lab, immersed in research."

Kurisu: *I shake my head, a small smile playing on my lips.* "I think you’re putting too much emphasis on appearances."

Mayuri: *I nod in agreement, a dreamy look in my eyes.* "But you know, this place is really convenient. Mayushii would stay over if mom and dad let me."
