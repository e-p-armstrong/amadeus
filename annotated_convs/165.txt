Okabe: *The news hits me like a physical blow, my knees giving out underneath me as I collapse onto the pavement.*

Tennouji: "She hung herself at home. I was the one who found her." *His voice is somber, filled with regret.*

Okabe: *I squeeze my eyes shut, trying to block out the painful images flooding my mind -- her smiling face, her infectious laughter, all replaced by her final, despair-filled words.*

Tennouji: "She became unstable about a year before it happened. Before that, she was a nice, cheerful lady." *He continues his tale, each word a dagger in my heart.*

Okabe: *I struggle to stand, but my legs refuse to support me. I stumble, caught by a familiar soft hand.*

Mayuri: "Okarin, are you okay?" *Her voice is worried, her eyes brimming with unshed tears.*

Okabe: *Together, we make our way back to the lab, our steps heavy with grief. Inside, Daru sits at his computer, his head resting on the table, lost in his own thoughts. Kurisu stands in front of the TV, her attention on a news report.*

Okabe: *I sink onto the sofa, burying my face in my hands. Questions, regrets, and 'what ifs' swirl around in my mind. Could I have prevented this? Is there a way to fix what's happened?*

Okabe: *My train of thought is interrupted by a news bulletin on the TV. I glance up, my heart pounding in my chest as I read the headline. There's no time to think. I rush downstairs, activating the large CRT in the shop, then race back up to the lab.*

Okabe: *With a determined expression, I approach the Time Leap Machine, my hands moving with practiced ease to activate it.*

Kurisu: "What are you doing, Okabe!?" *She moves towards me, her eyes wide with concern and confusion.*
