Plan:
1. Characters' personalities: Mayuri is cheerful, innocent, and a bit naive. Okabe is eccentric, dramatic, and protective, often lost in his own world. Kurisu is intelligent, serious, and somewhat shy, but also caring. 
2. For Mayuri, I will emphasize her cheerful and innocent nature, using actions that highlight her childlike wonder and joy. For Okabe, I will focus on his dramatic nature and eccentricities, but also his deep affection for Mayuri. For Kurisu, I will show her intelligence and reserved nature, but also her willingness to care for others.
3. The line "Heh, something like that could never kill me! Ten years ago, I was already a mad scientist with an IQ of 170, equaling that of Thomas Edison!" will serve as an anchor, encapsulating Okabe's eccentric personality and his tendency to escape into his own world.

Roleplay:

Mayuri: *I bounce on my heels, the excitement bubbling up in my chest.* "And it’s so close to work too♪ Hey, Chris-chan, why don’t we all stay over some time?"

Kurisu: *I nod, a faint smile crossing my lips.* "Sure, if the guys aren’t around."

Okabe: *I cross my arms, a smirk playing on my lips.* "That won’t happen."

Kurisu: *I tilt my head thoughtfully, a small smile tugging at the corner of my mouth.* "Then why don’t you come to my hotel, Mayuri-san?"

Mayuri: *My eyes light up, my hands coming together in a clap.* "Oh yeah, we did make that promise, huh? Ehehe! Then let’s do that next time♪"

Kurisu: *I nod, offering a small wave.* "You can come whenever you like. See you tomorrow." *As I say this, I start walking in the opposite direction from Akihabara Station.*

Mayuri: *As I watch Kurisu walk away, I stand still, my gaze turning skyward. I raise my hand towards the stars, performing my Stardust Handshake.* 

Okabe: *Watching Mayuri, I notice a shooting star streak across the sky.* "...Hey, Okarin."

Mayuri: *I continue to gaze at the sky, my hand still raised.* "Yeah. A shooting star. Did you make a wish?"

Okabe: *I watch her, the twinkle of the stars reflected in her eyes.* "Why are you bringing up that time in elementary school when I had a terrible fever?"

Mayuri: *I lower my hand, turning to Okabe with a soft smile on my face.* "I was so afraid that Okarin might die. So Granny and I prayed to the sky together. ’Don’t die, Okarin.’"

Okabe: *I laugh, a touch of bravado in my voice.* "Heh, something like that could never kill me! Ten years ago, I was already a mad scientist with an IQ of 170, equaling that of Thomas Edison!"

Mayuri: *My eyes widen, a gasp escaping my lips.* "Really? That’s amazing! But Mayushii was still really small, and didn’t know that, so I prayed to the sky. And then, on New Year’s Eve, right before midnight, a shooting star went pewww across the sky. Just like now. If you repeat your wish three times before a shooting star disappears, your wish will come true. Did you know that?"

Okabe: *I nod, a wistful smile on my face.* "Of course. That’s the most common of common knowledge."

Mayuri: *I beam at Okabe, my hands clasped together.* "The next day, on New Years, your fever went down, and you woke up. So basically, Mayushii saved your life! Ehehe!"

Okabe: *I chuckle, placing a hand on Mayuri's head.* "No. It was simply the choice of Steins Gate."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a confused expression on my face.* "Ehh? Really?"

Okabe: *I nod, a serious look on my face.* "Really."

Mayuri: *My shoulders slump, a small sigh escaping my lips.* "Oh..."
