Okabe: *I catch a glimpse of the sincere concern etched onto her face. She’s worried about me... my captive, worrying about her captor. A wry smile tugs at the corners of my mouth, unbidden.* "I’m fine. Don’t worry about a thing."

Okabe: *As I dismiss her concerns with a nonchalant shrug, my mind drifts back to a memory from a decade ago. A memory of awakening from a fever-induced stupor to the sight of Mayuri’s tear-streaked face. I remember, then, the sensation that had seized me just hours ago when Reading Steiner activated. It was eerily similar.* "I see! So this power was already mine back then! Muhahaha!"

Okabe: *My laughter ripples through the silence of the night, a testament to my newfound revelation. So, I was born with this power. No wonder John Titor thinks I’m the Messiah! As the echoes of my laughter fade, a knock at the door heralds the arrival of an unexpected guest.*

Luka: *I slide open the door, my voice a mere whisper, as I step into the lab.* "Pardon the intrusion..."

Itaru: "Oh, if it isn’t Luka-shi." *I look up from my computer, a smirk playing on my lips.*

Luka: *I bow slightly, acknowledging their presence.* "Hello, Hashida-san, Okabe-san."

Okabe: "Lukako! You don’t have Demon Sword Samidare with you! What is the meaning of this!?" *I exclaim, feigning shock and disappointment.*

Luka: "Eh, eh, eh?" *I stammer, taken aback by Okabe's theatrical outrage.*

Okabe: "I even unsealed the treasured heirloom sword Mistilteinn when I heard you were coming today. I’m disappointed in you." *I declare, placing a hand over my heart for dramatic effect.*

Luka: *My eyes widen in surprise and embarrassment.* "I’m sorry! Um, I’ll go back and get it."

Okabe: "No, that’s okay. It was not Mistilteinn’s fate to encounter Samidare this day." *I sigh wistfully, turning to gaze out the window with an expression of feigned melancholy.*

Itaru: "But a Japanese sword and a cursed sword from Norse mythology are so mismatched it’s not even funny. Do we even have a sword here?" *I chuckle, shaking my head at Okabe's antics.*

Luka: "What should I..." *I mumble, struggling to keep up with their banter.*

Okabe: "Lukako, though you are my disciple, you still lack dedication." *I say, my tone stern but not unkind.*

Luka: "I-I’m sorry!" *I bow apologetically, my face flushed with embarrassment.*

Okabe: "At this rate, it will take some time before you can be useful. By the way, why not join our lab?" *I ask, my tone softening as I extend the invitation.*

Luka: "Eh, me?" *I blink in surprise, caught off guard by his offer.*

Okabe: "Don’t sweat it. Mayuri’s the same." *I assure him, a hint of a smile tugging at my lips.*

Mayuri: "We’d love to have you, Luka-kun! But you know, if Luka-kun’s gonna be a lab mem, then Mayushii has one condition for Okarin. Don’t tease Luka-kun." *I step in, placing myself protectively between Luka and Okabe.*

Mayuri: "And today, Luka-kun is Mayushii’s guest. He came for a fitting session, so don’t get in our way." *I declare, shooting Okabe a stern look.*

Luka: "But Mayuri-chan, I don’t really want to cosplay... Um, can it really just be a fitting session?" *I ask, my voice barely above a whisper.*
