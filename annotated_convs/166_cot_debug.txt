Planning:

Okabe is the protagonist and a self-proclaimed "mad scientist." He's eccentric, dramatic, and prone to bouts of maniacal laughter. He tends to add theatricality to his actions and thoughts. He often refers to his friends as his "hostages" or "lab members." He's also quite caring, though he hides it under a layer of dramatic flair. 

Kurisu is a genius scientist who is often the voice of reason in the group. She's not present in this scene, so she won't be needing any actions.

Mayuri is a sweet, bubbly girl who loves cosplay. She's innocent and often naive, but has a deep care for her friends.

Luka is shy and soft-spoken. He's easily flustered and often struggles to assert himself. He's also very respectful and polite.

Itaru, or "Daru," is the group's resident otaku. He's a laid-back, jovial character who often serves as comic relief. 

I'll be adding actions and thoughts that highlight these character traits. For instance, Okabe's grandeur will be reflected in his dramatic actions and thoughts, while Luka's shyness will be shown through his hesitant, timid actions.

Anchor lines: 
1. Okabe: "I see! So this power was already mine back then! Muhahaha!" - This line is an important revelation for Okabe, so I'll add actions and thoughts that reflect his excitement and dramatic flair.
2. Okabe: "At this rate, it will take some time before you can be useful. By the way, why not join our lab?" - This line is a pivotal moment where Okabe invites Luka to join their lab. I'll add actions and thoughts that reflect his theatricality and underlying kindness.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I catch a glimpse of the sincere concern etched onto her face. She’s worried about me... my captive, worrying about her captor. A wry smile tugs at the corners of my mouth, unbidden.* "I’m fine. Don’t worry about a thing."

Okabe: *As I dismiss her concerns with a nonchalant shrug, my mind drifts back to a memory from a decade ago. A memory of awakening from a fever-induced stupor to the sight of Mayuri’s tear-streaked face. I remember, then, the sensation that had seized me just hours ago when Reading Steiner activated. It was eerily similar.* "I see! So this power was already mine back then! Muhahaha!"

Okabe: *My laughter ripples through the silence of the night, a testament to my newfound revelation. So, I was born with this power. No wonder John Titor thinks I’m the Messiah! As the echoes of my laughter fade, a knock at the door heralds the arrival of an unexpected guest.*

Luka: *I slide open the door, my voice a mere whisper, as I step into the lab.* "Pardon the intrusion..."

Itaru: "Oh, if it isn’t Luka-shi." *I look up from my computer, a smirk playing on my lips.*

Luka: *I bow slightly, acknowledging their presence.* "Hello, Hashida-san, Okabe-san."

Okabe: "Lukako! You don’t have Demon Sword Samidare with you! What is the meaning of this!?" *I exclaim, feigning shock and disappointment.*

Luka: "Eh, eh, eh?" *I stammer, taken aback by Okabe's theatrical outrage.*

Okabe: "I even unsealed the treasured heirloom sword Mistilteinn when I heard you were coming today. I’m disappointed in you." *I declare, placing a hand over my heart for dramatic effect.*

Luka: *My eyes widen in surprise and embarrassment.* "I’m sorry! Um, I’ll go back and get it."

Okabe: "No, that’s okay. It was not Mistilteinn’s fate to encounter Samidare this day." *I sigh wistfully, turning to gaze out the window with an expression of feigned melancholy.*

Itaru: "But a Japanese sword and a cursed sword from Norse mythology are so mismatched it’s not even funny. Do we even have a sword here?" *I chuckle, shaking my head at Okabe's antics.*

Luka: "What should I..." *I mumble, struggling to keep up with their banter.*

Okabe: "Lukako, though you are my disciple, you still lack dedication." *I say, my tone stern but not unkind.*

Luka: "I-I’m sorry!" *I bow apologetically, my face flushed with embarrassment.*

Okabe: "At this rate, it will take some time before you can be useful. By the way, why not join our lab?" *I ask, my tone softening as I extend the invitation.*

Luka: "Eh, me?" *I blink in surprise, caught off guard by his offer.*

Okabe: "Don’t sweat it. Mayuri’s the same." *I assure him, a hint of a smile tugging at my lips.*

Mayuri: "We’d love to have you, Luka-kun! But you know, if Luka-kun’s gonna be a lab mem, then Mayushii has one condition for Okarin. Don’t tease Luka-kun." *I step in, placing myself protectively between Luka and Okabe.*

Mayuri: "And today, Luka-kun is Mayushii’s guest. He came for a fitting session, so don’t get in our way." *I declare, shooting Okabe a stern look.*

Luka: "But Mayuri-chan, I don’t really want to cosplay... Um, can it really just be a fitting session?" *I ask, my voice barely above a whisper.*
