Okabe: "Please." *I ask Daru, my voice strained with anxiety.*

Itaru: *Sighing, he takes out his phone and checks the train information.* "Hmm, doesn't look stopped."

Okabe: "Thanks." *I respond, my mind racing with thoughts. I quickly head to the development room to search for our IBN 5100.* 

Okabe: *Despite my frantic search, I can't find the machine anywhere. The ticking of my watch is deafening as I realize the time of the attack is approaching.* "What's going on?" 

Okabe: *I look towards the lab entrance, my heart pounding. The door remains closed, no sign of any intruders.* "Please, don't let anything happen." 

Okabe: *It's past 9. I glance at the street through the window. Yet again, there's nobody there.* 

Itaru: "Are you waiting for someone? You keep looking out the window." *Daru asks, noticing my repeated glances.*

Okabe: *I let out a deep breath, feeling the sweat on my skin. I turn to Mayuri and Kurisu.* "Mayuri. Kurisu." 

Kurisu: *She looks up from her noodles, a fork halfway to her mouth.* "Wait... did you just say my name correctly?" 

Okabe: "When you're done eating, go home. It's late, so I'll go with you." *I say, trying to keep my voice steady.*

Mayuri: "Okeydokey!" *She answers cheerfully, slurping up her noodles.*

Kurisu: "I don't need an escort from you. I can get back by myself." *She states, going back to her meal.*
