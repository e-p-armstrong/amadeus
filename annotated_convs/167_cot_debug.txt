Planning: 

Characters:
1. Mayuri - Mayuri is an innocent, cheerful, and kind-hearted girl who is always optimistic and caring towards her friends. Her actions would reflect her bubbly personality, with lively expressions and enthusiastic body language.
2. Luka - Luka is shy and timid, which can be reflected in his actions by showing his hesitance and uneasiness. His body language would be more reserved and nervous. 
3. Okabe - Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, he tends to speak in a dramatic and over-the-top manner. His actions should be eccentric and theatrical. 
4. Itaru - Itaru is a relaxed, laid-back character with a perverted sense of humor. His actions can be more nonchalant and relaxed, with some moments of excitement when his interests are piqued. 

Anchor lines: 
1. Okabe: "Listen, my pupil. To change your clothes is to change your very being. This costume might help you grow stronger. Put it on at once!" - This line can be turned into a dramatic monologue by Okabe, emphasizing his eccentric personality and theatrical speech. 
2. Mayuri: "Come on, Luka-kun! Don’t be shy." - This can be a moment of encouragement from Mayuri, which reflects her caring and supportive nature. 

Roleplay:

Mayuri: *I proudly present my creation, the costume, with my hands outstretched, a wide smile gracing my face.* "This is a costume of Kirari-chan from RaiNet!"

Okabe: *I examine the costume, a raised eyebrow suggesting a hint of skepticism.* *Is it just my imagination, or is that outfit pretty skimpy?* *I glance over at Lukako, who seems equally taken aback, his eyes wide and mouth slightly agape.*

Mayuri: *I ignore their reactions, instead focusing on my excitement.* "Anyway, I’d say it’s about 70% complete, but I want Luka-kun to try it on now♪"

Luka: *I blink at Mayuri, my voice wavering as I look around nervously.* "Try it on? Here?"

Okabe: *I can see the blush creeping onto Lukako's face as he glances between me and Daru, his eyes quickly dropping to the floor in embarrassment.* 

Luka: *I wrap my arms around myself, as if trying to hide.* "I can’t..."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, putting on my best pleading expression.* "Please?"

Okabe: *I step forward, placing a hand on Lukako's shoulder.* "Listen, my pupil. To change your clothes is to change your very being. This costume might help you grow stronger. Put it on at once!"

Luka: *I look up at Okabe, my eyes wide with disbelief.* "You’re on her side? I just... can’t wear something so embarrassing!"

Okabe: *I shrug, an amused smirk playing on my lips.* "It’s only embarrassing because you think it is."

Mayuri: *I nod enthusiastically, clapping my hands together.* "That’s right! I’m sure you’ll be really cute♪"

Okabe: *I continue, my voice taking on a more serious tone.* "Besides, Mayuri worked very hard to make this costume so you could wear it. She sacrificed her sleeping time, her favorite banana nourishment time, and her Juicy Chicken Number One time just so she could sew and sew and sew. You can’t let effort like that go to waste."

Luka: *I lower my gaze, my hands wringing together nervously.* "That’s true, but..."

Okabe: *I watch as Lukako's resistance slowly weakens under our persuasion.* 

Mayuri: *I grab Lukako’s arm, pulling him towards the changing room with an excited squeal.* "Come on, Luka-kun! Transform! Tra-ns-form♪"

Luka: *I try to pull back, my protests falling on deaf ears.* "Eh, wait a sec, wahhhhhhh!"

Mayuri: *I continue to pull Lukako towards the changing room, completely oblivious to his discomfort.* "Okay! Don’t be shy! Now take off your clothes."

Luka: *I squeal, trying to pull away from Mayuri's eager hands.* "Wahh! Mayuri-chan, please don’t touch me there! I’ll change by myself! Please wait outside!"

Mayuri: *I wave off his protests, my excitement undeterred.* "But it’s a little tricky putting this on. Mayushii will teach you all the steps♪"

Luka: *I plead, my voice filled with panic.* "Hyeeehhh, please don’t undress me!"

Itaru: *I watch the scene with a smirk, my voice filled with amusement.* "It’s so... yuri."

Okabe: *I roll my eyes at Daru's comment, crossing my arms over my chest.* "That’s not yuri. Lukako’s a guy."

Itaru: *My eyes widen, my smirk growing wider.* "Then it’s reverse rape!? Whoa, that’s downright criminal!"

Okabe: *I sigh, shaking my head at Daru's wild imagination.* 

Mayuri: *I emerge from the changing room, a satisfied smile on my face.* "Come on, Luka-kun! Don’t be shy."

Okabe: *I watch as Lukako hesitates, even when Mayuri calls for him.* 

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a hint of concern in my voice.* "Luka-kun?"
