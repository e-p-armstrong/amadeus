Kurisu: *I give a dismissive wave of my hand, trying to maintain an air of nonchalance.* "Don’t react to every little thing, you perv."

Okabe: *I choose to keep quiet about Lukako's true gender, deciding it would complicate things further. I nod to myself, an unspoken agreement to let the misunderstanding be.*

Kurisu: *I clear my throat, bringing the attention back to the topic at hand.* "At any rate..."

Okabe: *I point a finger at Christina, adopting a stern expression.* "Christina. Stop eying Lukako’s entire body from top to bottom like that."

Kurisu: *I sputter, my face flushing a bright red.* "I-I wasn’t doing that!"

Mayuri: *I bounce on the balls of my feet, my eyes sparkling with excitement.* "Do you like the costume, Chris-chan? It really suits Luka-kun, don’t you think?"

Kurisu: *I nod, appreciating the craftsmanship of the outfit.* "Is this that cosplay thing I’ve heard about? It’s part of Japanimation culture, right? You’re very cute."

Luka: *I stutter, my hands nervously fiddling with the hem of my costume.* "C-c-cute? No way..."

Okabe: *I observe as Lukako's eyes well up with tears, a sight that pulls at my heartstrings.*

Kurisu: *I tilt my head in confusion, genuinely concerned.* "Why are you crying? You look perfect, so you should be more confident."

Luka: *I whimper, feeling overwhelmed by the situation.* "Uuugh..."

Okabe: *I scratch my head, realizing that Kurisu's ignorance is causing more harm than good. I decide to divert the conversation, for Lukako's sake.* "Heh heh heh..." *I comb back my hair with my fingers, adopting a mischievous grin.* "Lukako! Tell us your wish."

Luka: *I blink, caught off guard by the sudden question.* "Eh...?"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, a small smirk playing on my lips.* "That’s one hell of an acrobatic topic change."

Okabe: *I spread my arms wide, my voice booming throughout the room.* "Listen, Lukako! Your desires can become reality. Japan is a land of great spiritual power. It resides in every word that slips from your tongue! Now that you too have joined the otaku world, you need conceal your deepest desires no longer! Speak your wish with a true heart, and by the chaos that rules Akihabara, Steins Gate shall grant it!"

Luka: *I fidget, my cheeks blushing a soft pink.* "My... wish?"

Okabe: *I watch as Lukako's bashfulness reaches a peak, his reaction almost too powerful to bear.*

Luka: *I lower my gaze, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Well... If I tell you... promise not to laugh?"

Okabe: *I give a firm nod, my voice filled with determination.* "There’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Just proclaim it to the world!"

Kurisu: *I scoff, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Well yeah, no wish is embarrassing compared to the idiotic wish for chaos to envelop the world or whatever."

Okabe: *I point an accusing finger at my assistant, my face twisted in mock outrage.* "You, assistant! What kind of person laughs at people’s wishes!?"

Mayuri: *I raise my hand, excited to share my own desires.* "Um, Mayushii’s wish is to eat a ton of yummy food, and to cover the lab with Upa goods, and to get Luka-kun to wear my costumes--"

Okabe: *I wave my hand dismissively, cutting her off.* "I’m not asking you."

Mayuri: *I pout, feeling left out.* "But Mayushii wants ’Shota in the Gate’ to grant her wish too!"

Itaru: *I chuckle, appreciating the humor in Mayuri's innocent mistake.* "’Shota in the Gate’!? That mistake is god tier. Probably because it’s so... naughty."
