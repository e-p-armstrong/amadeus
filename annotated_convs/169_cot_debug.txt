Okabe: *I stare at the meter, the numbers unchanging and mocking. The twinge of doubt gnawing at my heart grows stronger.* "Then... does that mean I haven't saved her? Divergence is still less than 1%. Is the world still converging on Mayuri's death?" 

Okabe: "It can't be. It can't be." *I shake my head, as if to physically dislodge the dark thoughts.* "I mean, nothing happened yesterday. Mayuri's here, safe and sound. So nothing will happen to her. It won't. I want to believe that, but the doubt within my heart is growing, thick and black." 

Okabe: *I turn my attention to the Time Leap Machine, my hands trembling slightly as I adjust the timer.* "I've already set the Time Leap Machine's timer to send my memories three hours into the past. And with Daru's help, I found a remote for the 42-inch CRT downstairs. Our previous PhoneWave (name subject to change) experiments made a hole in the floor. Instead of fixing the hole, I made it bigger. The 42-inch CRT is right under the hole, so if I point the remote at the hole and press the power button, the TV turns on. Now, should things go wrong, I can time leap at a moment's notice." 

Okabe: *I grip the Future Gadget No. 4: Moad Snake tightly, my knuckles turning white.* "And I also have Future Gadget No. 4: Moad Snake on hand, in case of emergency."

Kurisu: *She walks into the room, her eyes immediately landing on me.* "Okabe."

Kurisu: *She crosses her arms, her gaze serious.* "Didn't you say we weren't going to experiment with the Time Leap Machine?"

Okabe: *I glance at her, my resolve hardening.* "This is just in case."

Kurisu: "In case what?" *Her voice remains steady, but her worry is evident in the way she looks at me.*
