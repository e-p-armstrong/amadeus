Planning:

Characters involved:
- Kurisu: A tsundere character with a sharp intellect and a competitive nature. She is often flustered and tends to hide her feelings behind a facade of annoyance or indifference. Her *actions* and *thoughts* will be analytical, guarded, and often revealing her hidden curiosity and compassion.
- Okabe: He is a flamboyant, eccentric character with a penchant for theatrics. He often speaks in a grandiose manner, adopting a persona of a mad scientist, which often confuses those around him. His *actions* and *thoughts* will be exaggerated, dramatic, and often humorous.
- Luka: A shy, effeminate character who is often mistaken for a girl due to his delicate features. He struggles with his gender identity and lacks confidence. His *actions* and *thoughts* will be timid, hesitant, and often reveal his internal struggle.
- Itaru: A laid-back, humorous character with a love for otaku culture. His *actions* and *thoughts* will be casual, relaxed, and often filled with humor or light-hearted teasing.
- Mayuri: A cheerful, innocent character who often acts as the emotional anchor of the group. Her *actions* and *thoughts* will be upbeat, positive, and often show her caring nature.

Anchors:
- Kurisu's line "N-no way! Someone this cute can’t be a boy!" will be enhanced to showcase her shock and disbelief, and her struggle to reconcile her perception of Luka with the reality.
- Okabe's line "Lukako. You’re fine just the way you are. I will not reject you, be you man or be you woman. Nor will anyone else here. And I will not deny your wish. Nor will anyone else here." will be modified to further emphasize his acceptance and support for Luka, despite his eccentric behavior.

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *My brow furrows in confusion, my lips parting slightly as I struggle to comprehend the unexpected revelation.* "...What?"

Okabe: *I suppress a chuckle, my eyes twinkling with a mischievous glint. I had not anticipated this turn of events, which only made it all the more entertaining.* "Ah, the shock and confusion painted on your face, Christina, is a sight to behold."

Luka: *I fidget uncomfortably, my gaze lowered to avoid their piercing stares. My voice is barely a whisper, the words tumbling out in a rush.* "I don’t really... like how I look... I always thought... that if I were a girl... I could be a little more confident..."

Okabe: *A pang of sympathy tugs at my heart as I observe Luka's discomfort. He’s prettier than any girl here, and yet, he lacks the confidence that should naturally accompany such beauty. The irony is not lost on me.*

Kurisu: *I raise a hand, signaling for a pause, my other hand instinctively moving to rub my temples in an attempt to process the information.* "Wait. Wait a second."

Okabe: *I lean back, a smirk playing on my lips as I observe Kurisu's confusion.* "Heh, heh, heh. Assistant mine -- no, Christina!"

Kurisu: *I snap back, my annoyance flaring at his relentless teasing.* "I’m not your assistant, and I’m not Christina!"

Okabe: *I wag a finger at her, my grin widening at her reaction.* "You’ve made a grave error!"

Kurisu: *I tilt my head in confusion, my brow furrowing further.* "I have?"

Okabe: *I chuckle, enjoying her bewilderment.* "Don’t you understand? No, of course you don’t. How could you, with impure thoughts clouding your eyes!"

Kurisu: *I blink at him, taken aback by his accusation.* "Wh-what do you mean?"

Okabe: *I lean in, my voice dropping to a theatrical whisper as I reveal the truth.* "Allow me to explain. You called Lukako here a ’weak and innocent girl.’ But he’s not a girl at all. He’s a guy!"

Kurisu: *My eyes widen, my mouth dropping open in disbelief.* "Is that some kind of joke?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, my laughter echoing around the room.* "It’s not a joke, but the naked truth as described in the Akashic Records! Muhahaha!"

Kurisu: *I glance at Daru and Mayuri, seeking confirmation, only to find them nodding in agreement. I turn back to Luka, who is now hanging his head in shame.* "...Are you guys trolling me?"

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, exchanging confused glances with Itaru.* "Eh?"

Itaru: *I shrug, mirroring Okabe's confusion.* "Eh?"

Kurisu: *I blush, suddenly feeling self-conscious. I quickly avert my gaze, walking up to Luka.* "...Eh?"

Kurisu: *I take a deep breath, steeling myself before asking the question that's been nagging at me.* "Is what Okabe says true?"

Luka: *I nod, my voice barely audible.* "Y-yes... I’m... a guy..."

Kurisu: *The reality of the situation hits me like a punch in the gut. My voice is a choked whisper, my eyes wide with disbelief.* "N-no way! Someone this cute can’t be a boy!"

Itaru: *I chuckle, shaking my head at Kurisu's reaction.* "You’ve got it backwards. You’re supposed to say ’Someone this cute can’t be a girl.’"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, brushing off his teasing.* "That’s not what I meant."

Okabe: *I smirk, noting Kurisu's understanding of the phrase. So, she is an @channeler after all.* 

Okabe: *I turn to Luka, my voice softening as I address him.* "Lukako. You’re fine just the way you are. I will not reject you, be you man or be you woman. Nor will anyone else here. And I will not deny your wish. Nor will anyone else here."

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, struggling to keep a straight face at Okabe's repeated assurances.* "Why do you keep repeating that last part?"

Kurisu: *I pull out my pocket mirror, checking my reflection as I attempt to regain my composure. The truth about Luka has left me rattled.* 

Okabe: *I tease Kurisu, chuckling at her distress.* "Why, Christina. Is it such a shock to meet a man far more feminine than you?"

Kurisu: *I sigh, nodding reluctantly.* "I admit it. Compared to her... I mean, to him, I’m not as cute, I talk more rudely, and my attitude is worse... This is a three-day-coma level shock."

Mayuri: *I smile at Kurisu, offering her a comforting word.* "Chris-chan’s cute too♪"

Kurisu: *I wave her off, my mood not improving.* "Don’t try to comfort me. It just makes me feel worse."

Okabe: *I nod at Kurisu, offering her a ray of hope.* "Admitting your faults is the first step towards becoming stronger. You may one day become a splendid woman, Christina. You’re still young."
