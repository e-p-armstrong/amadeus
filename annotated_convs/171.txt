Okabe: *With a dramatic wave of my hand, I point an accusing finger at Kurisu.* "I take it back! You’re a stubborn fool who refuses to face the truth!"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, turning my head away in frustration.* "Shut up. I don’t want to hear that from you."

Luka: *I timidly interject, my voice barely above a whisper, my hands nervously fidgeting with the hem of my dress.* "Um... sorry. I shouldn’t have said anything."

Okabe: *I see Luka bow his head, his eyes red and puffy. With such a cute girl -- err, boy -- on the verge of tears, Kurisu and I have no choice but to stop arguing.*

Itaru: *I pull out my digital camera, my eyes gleaming mischievously.* "Welp, better get my trusty digicam..."

Kurisu: *She scowls, pointing an accusatory finger at Itaru.* "Don’t try to sneak in a photo session, you perv!"

Itaru: *I shrug, smirking at her reaction.* "Anzai-sensei, I want to be a low angler..."

Okabe: *I reflect on Luka's earlier words, my gaze softening.* "Lukako, how serious are you about that wish of yours?"

Luka: *I shyly look away, my cheeks flushing a soft pink.* "You know those stories where a guy magically turns into a girl overnight? Sometimes I wish that would happen to me. Ahaha... that’s stupid, isn’t it?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, giving Luka a gentle smile.* "Luka-kun, you’re so cute♪"

Kurisu: *I stammer, my cheeks turning a noticeable shade of pink.* "S-So cute..."

Kurisu: *Clearing my throat, I begin to speak in a more professional tone.* "This reminds me of something I heard once."

Itaru: *I give her a teasing grin, leaning back in my chair.* "Exposition scene, go!"

Kurisu: *I straighten up, my eyes focusing on a distant point as I remember.* "There’s a saying that if you eat a lot of meat when you’re pregnant, you’ll have a boy, and if you eat a lot of vegetables, you’ll have a girl."

Itaru: *I chuckle, shaking my head in amusement.* "Source? Minmei Shobou?"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, a faint smile playing on my lips.* "I saw it on the internet."

Itaru: *I rub the back of my neck, laughing nervously.* "S-so that’s how you reply... well played."

Kurisu: *I frown, my brows furrowing in confusion.* "Wh-what are you talking about?"

Mayuri: *I gasp, my eyes wide in surprise.* "Really? I didn’t know that. So Mayushii and Chris-chan’s moms ate a lot of vegetables?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my finger tapping against my lips in thought.* "Mayushii only eats Juicy Chicken Number One, so will her future child be a boy? Hey, do you think bananas count as vegetables?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, challenging Kurisu's theory.* "But what about primitive people who lived on hunting? If that theory is true, then they would have had too many boys and not enough girls. Humanity would never have made it this far."
