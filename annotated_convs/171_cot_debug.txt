Okabe: *I sigh deeply, running a hand through my hair.* "It looks like I'll have to explain everything all over again."

Kurisu: "Hmmm..." *She murmurs thoughtfully, nodding along as I recount the series of events.*

Okabe: "So basically, you win if you get the IBN 5100 back." *I repeat her conclusion, my eyebrows furrowing as I try to make sense of it all.*

Kurisu: "This is just a guess..." *She begins, her eyes narrowing in concentration.* "But maybe you should look at what Amane-san said from the opposite angle. I think the critical change takes place when you get the IBN 5100 and erase the data in SERN's database. That instant is most likely when you'll achieve divergence over 1%."

Okabe: "The problem is where the IBN 5100 is now." *I mutter, my gaze falling to the floor.*

Kurisu: "You've already found it once. That is, if your memories are real. If you can get back to the worldline where you first obtained it, then isn't it bound to return to you?" *She suggests, her voice filled with cautious optimism.*

Okabe: "I see... You're right. The IBN 5100 was at the lab, and then it suddenly disappeared." *I agree, my mind racing as I try to piece together the puzzle.*

Kurisu: "You threw a fit about that earlier. I remember thinking, 'Oh god, Okabe's finally lost his ability to distinguish fantasy from reality.'" *She recalls, a hint of amusement in her voice at the memory.*

Okabe: "You're such a wannabe American. What do you mean, 'oh god'? Oh, I get it. Chris-chan is a Chris-tian." *I retort, attempting to lighten the mood with a poorly thought out joke.*

Kurisu: "That's terrible." *She deadpans, rolling her eyes at my pun.*

Okabe: "...I regret it too." *I admit, grimacing at my failed attempt at humor.*

Okabe: "So, Christina... let me see if I understand what you're saying. The changes we made to the worldline -- namely, all of the D-Mails we've sent -- must be reversed. That will return us to the worldline where I found the IBN 5100 at Yanabayashi Shrine." *I summarize, finally understanding the gravity of our situation.*

Kurisu: "It's still a hypothesis. I only came to that conclusion based on your explanation. If you're mistaking your facts, deceiving me, or shooting off delusions, then this hypothesis will fail." *She warns, her gaze serious as she meets my eyes.*

Okabe: "You can't just blindly follow this hypothesis either. You may have a safety net, but if you get careless and leave yourself without a way out... Then you'll never get another chance to save Mayuri." *I respond, the weight of her words sinking in.*

Kurisu: "Why did the IBN 5100 disappear? Which of the D-Mails caused its disappearance? Figure that out, and you're well on your way to finding the solution." *She advises, her confidence bolstering my determination.*

Okabe: "What I don't understand is how we delayed the timing of Mayuri's death exactly 24 hours." *I ponder, my mind still filled with questions.*

Kurisu: "True, that is interesting. Maybe it's related to the change in divergence. It could be the Butterfly Effect. If that's the case, any trivial change could produce a significantly deviant result. Anyway, it's important to act with discretion. Don't do anything careless. Your death, Okabe, is the worst thing that could possibly happen. You're probably the only person who can remember previous worldlines. If you die, then consider Mayuri dead for good. ...Don't die. Okay?" *She finishes, her voice softening with concern.*
