Kurisu: *I heave a sigh, the weight of the situation pressing down on me.* "...*sigh*"

Okabe: *Ignoring the inquisitive glances from Mayuri and Daru, I turn to face our newest recruit.* "Very well. Lukako, you are officially Lab Mem Number 006. Henceforth, pledge your allegiance to the lab, and devote all your strength to the enrichment of our science."

Luka: *I bow deeply, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Y-yes! I will! I’m so happy."

Okabe: *Raising my hand in a grand gesture, I declare,* "Now then, let’s begin the experiment immedia--" *But my sentence is cut short as a realization hits me. Smacking my forehead in dismay, I pivot to face Lukako.* "Damn! Lukako, you’re 16, right?"

Luka: *My eyes widen at Okabe's sudden attention, and I stutter out a response.* "Um... right."

Okabe: "So you were born in 1993..." *I begin to pace, my mind racing.*

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, a look of innocent confusion on my face.* "Yup! The same year as Mayushii. What about it?"

Okabe: *I stop pacing, my hands clenching into fists at my sides.* "When did cellphones become widespread in Japan!?" 

Kurisu: *My eyes widen in understanding.* "Ah..."

Itaru: *Leaning back in my chair, I pull out my phone to search for the answer.* "Around 1996. There wasn’t mail until later, though."

Okabe: "So the year Lukako was born, most people still didn’t have cellphones. Lukako’s mother may not have had one. In that case, she might not be able to receive the D-Mail!" *My voice grows louder with each word, the frustration evident in my tone.*

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, realization dawning on my face.* "Oh! I get it!"

Luka: *A shadow falls across my face, and I clutch my hands together nervously.* "Eh...? We can’t do it?"

Itaru: *I shrug, a smirk playing on my lips.* "What about modifying it to send crazy waves or something?"

Kurisu: *I narrow my eyes at Itaru, a look of disbelief on my face.* "What the hell are crazy waves?"

Itaru: "Waves that only crazy girls can pick up. You know, girls who always talk about stuff no one understands. It’s pretty moe."

Kurisu: *I shoot Itaru a glare, my patience thinning.* "I’ll microwave your brain if you don’t shut up."

Itaru: "Yes! Abuse me more, please!"

Mayuri: "Um, couldn’t you put a letter in a time capsule and bury it?"

Kurisu: "That would go to the future, not the past."

Mayuri: "Oh..."

Itaru: "I know! How about that thing where you get struck by lightning and that turns you into a girl! Like in old comics and anime."

Kurisu: "There’s no point to the experiment if we don’t use D-Mail. Don’t lose sight of the objective."

Mayuri: "We’re counting on you for a nice idea, Chris-chan♪"

Kurisu: *I freeze, my eyes darting around the room as I rack my brain for an idea.* "M-me? I... We could... build a rocket which exceeds the speed of light squared, then that immense speed would reverse the flow of time, or something..."

Itaru: "You’re forgetting about the PhoneWave too."

Okabe: "Furthermore, genius girl, you just contradicted relativity."

Kurisu: *I let out a sigh of exasperation, crossing my arms over my chest.* "It was just a joke. Don’t take it seriously."

Okabe: *I throw my hands up in the air, exasperation seeping into my voice.* "Useless, all of you! This lab is a disgrace!"
