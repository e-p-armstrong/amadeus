Okabe: "It's not delicious." *I say, my eyes fixated on the complex machine in the development room.*

Mayuri: "It's a greeting I can only use for Okarin, so why not? Ehehe!" *She giggles, her eyes sparkling with innocent merriment.*

Okabe: "Where's Daru?" *I ask, my voice barely above a whisper.*

Mayuri: "Hmm, probably at MayQueen?" *She tilts her head in thought.*

Okabe: "MayQueen..." *I murmur, staring into the distance.* "So that's back too."

Mayuri: "'Course I do! You know that, Okarin. You're so weird! Mayushii's taking a break to prepare for ComiMa tomorrow." *She replies cheerfully, completely unaware of the heavy thoughts weighing on my mind.*

Okabe: *I glance at Kurisu, still engrossed in her book, before turning my attention back to the Time Leap Machine.* "Just before entering the lab, I peeked into the Braun Tube Workshop. The 42-inch CRT was on, so there's no problem there. Still... Will Mayuri really die on the 15th? I don't have solid proof." *I pace restlessly across the room, my mind racing with thoughts and uncertainties.*

Kurisu: "Okabe?" *She looks up from her book, concern etched in her brows.* "What are you doing? I thought we weren't going to--" *She trails off, her eyes meeting mine in a silent question.*
