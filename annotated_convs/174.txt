Okabe: *I furrow my brows, tapping my fingers against my chin in deep thought.* "Hmm... I can feel it. Inspiration is flashing in the corners of my brain."

Itaru: *I lean back, crossing my arms with a smirk.* "That Edison thing again?"

Okabe: *I can feel the familiar sensation rushing through me. The sparks of my natural mad scientist inspiration are about to explode.* "I have it."

Okabe: *I stand up abruptly, my gaze sweeping across everyone present, a broad grin splitting my face.* "If we can’t send it to a cellphone, then we’ll send it... to a pager!"
