Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my eyes curiously narrowing as I consider the number before us.* "Why 831?"

Itaru: *I chuckle, rolling my eyes as I lean back in my chair.* "8(ya) 3(sa) 1(i) for veggies (yasai), duh. VEGGIES VEGGIES VEGGIES -- we just have to drill this into Luka-shi’s mother’s brain."

Okabe: *I cross my arms over my chest, shaking my head.* "She’ll just pass that message off as a prank."

Mayuri: *My eyes light up with a new idea, and I clap my hands together excitedly.* "Then, how about ’29292929’?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, my voice laced with a hint of apprehension.* "I’m going to regret asking this, but what does that mean?"

Mayuri: *I bounce on my heels, grinning widely as I explain.* "Ni(2) ku(9) for meat. MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT."

Okabe: *I throw my hands up in exasperation, my voice rising in disbelief.* "Why do you want her to like meat!?"

Mayuri: *I tap my finger against my chin thoughtfully, my gaze focused on Okabe.* "That’s not it! If you keep repeating ’MEAT’, then she’ll actually start to hate meat and want to eat vegetables instead, don’t you think?"

Itaru: *I shrug, shaking my head with a smirk.* "Yeah... no."

Luka: *I quietly finish my composition while the others continue their discussion, my voice barely above a whisper.* "How about something like this? ’MOM EAT VEGGIES OK’"

Itaru: *I scratch the back of my head, my gaze skeptical.* "Isn’t that a little too vague?"

Okabe: *I point at the composition, my voice firm and decisive.* "And the first ’MOM’ should go. That’ll just make it harder to believe."

Luka: *I nervously adjust my outfit, biting my lip as I try to improve my suggestion.* "Then... ’EAT LOTS OF VEGGIES TO GIVE BIRTH TO A GIRL’."

Kurisu: *I lean forward, my fingers tracing the edge of the table as I scrutinize Luka's suggestion.* "That’s a little too direct. And it’s over the character limit."

Luka: *I swallow, my hands trembling as I offer another suggestion.* "’EAT VEGGIES FOR HEALTHY KID’"

Itaru: *I glance at a conversion chart, my eyebrows furrowing as I realize a problem.* "Wait a sec. According to this conversion chart, it looks like you gotta use two more numbers for voiced consonants. So that sentence is four bytes over."

Okabe: *I lean back, my fingers drumming on the table as I ponder the message.* "Then a little modification. How about ’EAT VEG 4 HEALTHY KID’?"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, my voice skeptical.* "Isn’t that a little too informal? You’re talking to Urushibara-san’s mother, you know? Would she understand the ’VEG 4’ part?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, challenging Kurisu.* "You have any bright ideas?"

Kurisu: *I shrug, unable to provide a better suggestion, and remain silent.*

Mayuri: *I excitedly reach for the keyboard, my fingers poised above the keys.* "Come on, let’s type it out!"

Okabe: *I oversee the input into the X68000, my heart pounding in anticipation as the long, random-looking string of numbers is completed.* "Alright, we’re good to go."

Okabe: *I guide Lukako to the PhoneWave, the microwave timer set to 154152 seconds. The margin of error is around 1-3 days, I guess. Leap year calculation’s a pain, so I ignored it. Lukako’s slender finger starts to tremble on top of the enter button.* "Ready? I’m starting it up."
