Okabe: *As the familiar sensation of Reading Steiner subsides, I scan the room, my gaze landing on Lukako, who still sits across from me. I narrow my eyes, studying his unchanged form, before he blushes and averts his gaze.*
"Um, Okabe-san, could you... please not look at me like that?"

Okabe: *I cross my arms, tilting my head thoughtfully as I continue my examination of Lukako. My eyes fall on his flat chest, a telltale sign of his unchanged gender. The evidence is damning.* "It... didn’t work?" *I mutter, disappointment creeping into my voice.*

Okabe: *I shake my head, frustration simmering beneath the surface. Kurisu's vegetable theory was nothing more than fringe science, it seems.* 

Mayuri: "What didn’t work?" *Her voice cuts through the tense silence, her confusion palpable.*

Okabe: *I glance around, seeing the same confusion mirrored on everyone's faces. I open my mouth to explain, but quickly clamp it shut. I can't afford to be careless.* "Don’t you remember? Just now, we used the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to--" *I slap a hand over my mouth, cutting myself off.*

Okabe: *I sigh, running a hand through my hair. The weight of my unique ability presses down on me.* "Sorry. It’s nothing." *I wave off their concerned glances, forcing a smile onto my face.*

Okabe: *I watch Mayuri and Lukako leave for lunch, their cheerfulness a stark contrast to my own turmoil. I turn to Kurisu, my voice hesitant.* "Christina. I want to ask you something. Is Lukako..."

Kurisu: *Her eyes narrow, her voice taking on a defensive edge.* "What pervy act are you thinking about this time? Can’t be too careful around the perv duo."

Itaru: *He waves a dismissive hand, grinning unabashedly.* "We’re not a perv duo. We are a pervy gentlemen duo!"

Kurisu: *She rolls her eyes, her words dripping with sarcasm.* "Whatever. Seriously, whatever."

Okabe: *I grimace, my question dying on my lips. It's clear that no one remembers the experiment, and I don't dare risk explaining it all over again.* "Muh..."

Okabe: *Once alone, I make my way to MayQueen+Nyan², my mind heavy with uncertainty. I glance across the table at Daru, his impatience barely concealed as we wait for our order.* "Daru. What do you think about D-Mail?"

Itaru: *He shrugs, his casual demeanor belying his thoughtful words.* "It’s cool, but it’s kinda lame at the same time."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, curious despite myself.* "What’s lame about it?"

Itaru: *He sighs dramatically, his disappointment clear.* "I couldn’t use it to win my RaiNet match against Faris-tan."

Okabe: *I shake my head, a small chuckle escaping me despite the weight of our situation.* "As our experiments have shown, D-Mail still hasn’t reached a reliable level of precision. A true time machine must remove luck from the equation. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is useless unless we can somehow give the sender more control."
