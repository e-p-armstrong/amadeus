Okabe: "That's why I'm consulting you, so I can find a way to do this while hurting her the least." *I take a deep breath, my fingers gripping the can of Dr P tightly as I take a gulp, hoping to quell my mounting frustration.*

Okabe: "...If only I hadn't been so careless. I shouldn't have let so many people send D-Mails." *I shake my head, the regret and guilt evident in my voice.*

Kurisu: "Regret won't change anything. There's only one piece of advice I can give." *She sighs deeply, pushing her bangs away from her face with an air of resignation.*

Kurisu: "Don't say anything to Urushibara-san." *Her voice is steady and firm, despite the gravity of the situation.*

Okabe: "What do you mean?" *I turn to face her, my brows furrowed in confusion.*

Kurisu: "Based on what you've told me, you have the advantage this time. You already know the contents of the D-Mail. So you don't have to tell her -- him? Ex-him? ...You don't have to tell Urushibara-san. Just send the cancellation D-Mail." *She explains, her gaze focused on me.*

Okabe: "You mean pose as Lukako and send the mail to her mother myself?" *I ask, the idea slowly sinking in.*

Kurisu: "If the worldline changes, then that will all be undone. In which case, ethical concerns don't really matter." *She shrugs, her expression unreadable.*

Okabe: "Just one problem. I don't know her mother's pager number." *I grimace, the realization hitting me.*

Kurisu: "What!? Are you an idiot!? Why didn't you write it down!?" *She throws her hands up in exasperation, clearly frustrated with my oversight.*

Okabe: "I didn't think I would need it!" *I defend myself, feeling a pang of guilt for my negligence.*

Kurisu: *She clicks her tongue, rubbing her brow with her fingers as she mutters to herself, clearly trying to think of a solution.*

Kurisu: "What if you just ask for the pager number directly? Think up a good excuse." *She suggests, her tone practical.*

Okabe: "That's going to look suspicious..." *I mumble, the weight of the situation starting to get to me.*

Kurisu: "What are you so scared of? That's not the vain and arrogant Okabe I know." *She challenges, her gaze piercing.*

Okabe: *I shake my head, my determination reigniting.* "Maybe I should just tell her the truth. Sincerity will work better than underhanded tricks... I think."

Kurisu: "A mad scientist, sincere? That's a good one. It's more like you to say 'I'll brainwash her, muhahaha!'." *She lets out a dry laugh, finding humor in my words.*

Okabe: "I will shoulder Lukako's pain. That's my responsibility. When I cancel that D-Mail, the fact that she was a girl will be undone. I'm the only one who can carry that burden." *I declare, the resolve in my voice echoing in the room.*

Kurisu: "So what are you talking to me for? Go to her now, and tell her what you told me." *She says, her words punctuating the heavy silence that follows.*
