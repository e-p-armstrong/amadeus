Itaru: *I rub my temple, a frown of frustration etched onto my face.* "Yeah, we aren’t getting results. What about the LOTO SIX?"

Okabe: *I cross my arms, my gaze distant and contemplative.* "Pending."

*I can't help but think that it was Lukako’s mistake that cost us the prize, but I wouldn't have put him in that position if I hadn't asked him to buy the ticket in my stead. Why did I do that? It feels like Steins Gate is playing a cruel joke on me. No, I need to push away these negative thoughts.*

Okabe: *My eyes flash with renewed determination.* "Hououin Kyouma will not let this keep him down. I won’t give up. For I am a mad scientist!"

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, trying to suppress a chuckle.* "I don’t understand what you’re saying, but you sure seem confident about it."

Okabe: *I grip the air in front of me, my voice rising in fervor.* "Someday we will improve the PhoneWave (name subject to change) so that it may be used to send things not only to the past, but also to the future. We’ll improve it. No, we must improve it! For that is the choice of Steins Gate! Muhahahaha!"

Faris: *I appear from nowhere, my eyes wide with surprise.* "A time machine!?"

Okabe: "!!?"

*I jump at Faris's sudden appearance. When did she sneak up on me?*

Okabe: *I whirl around, my face red with embarrassment.* "Damn you, Faris! Eavesdropping is cowardly!"

Faris: *I tilt my head, my eyes innocent.* "What do you mean? Your voice is so loud, it echoes through the whole store nya."

*My heart sinks. I've done it again. I've carelessly leaked classified information concerning the future of mankind!*

Faris: *I set down a tray of drinks and food with a flourish.* "Here’s your iced coffee, and your iced tea and ’cat food’. Thanks for waiting, nyan♪"

*Looking at Daru’s order of cat food, a specialty of this maid cafe, I can't help but feel a twinge of envy. It's not the usual miso over rice, but a stylish risotto instead. Daru seems to love it, and I must admit, it's pretty tasty. As Faris places the ice coffee in front of me, I can't help but feel a sense of anticipation.*

Faris: "Do you want milk and syrup nyan?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, trying to maintain my dignity.* "NEVER."

Faris: *I pout, pouring milk and syrup into Okabe's glass.* "If Kyouma’s gonna be like that, I’ll pour it all in nya! You need sugar for a healthy brain, nyan♪"

*Despite my protest, Faris pours all of the milk and syrup into my glass. I watch in helpless frustration as she ruins my perfect coffee.*

Faris: *I stir the coffee, a mischievous glint in my eyes.* "Nyan nyan, nyan nyan♪"

*As she mixes my iced coffee with the straw, she keeps her gaze locked with mine. It's as if she's casting some sort of spell on me.*

Itaru: *I lean forward, my eyes shining with admiration.* "There it is! Faris-tan’s secret technique, ’Eye Contact Mix-Mix’!"

*Daru's excited explanation brings a moment of levity to the tense situation.*

Itaru: "Most maids can’t do it without spilling a little, yet Faris-tan makes it look easy! That’s why I love her! It’s because of this secret technique that Faris-tan reigns supreme as MayQueen’s number one maid!"

*As I watch the iced coffee in the glass change from black to brown, I realize that Faris has once again pulled me into her rhythm. She moves on to perform the same secret technique on Daru.*

Itaru: *I beam at Faris, my heart full of gratitude.* "Thank you, Faris-tan! I’ll be sure to savor it."
