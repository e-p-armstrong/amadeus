Faris: *I lean in close, my eyes sparkling with genuine curiosity.* "I wanna hear the rest, nya♪ Kyouma and Daru-nyan were having a fun little chit-chat, nya? Something about a time machine. Faris really wants to hear, nyan!"

Okabe: *I cross my arms over my chest, a firm denial in my eyes.* "It’s top secret. Not for outsiders!"

Faris: *I tilt my head, a playful smirk playing on my lips.* "And whose big mouth let the whole store hear, nya? Tell Faris, Daru-nyan..."

Itaru: *I gulp nervously, my fingers drumming on the table.* "We’ve built an amazing machine that can send emails to the past. I did most of the work, of course."

Okabe: *I pinch the bridge of my nose, feeling a headache coming on.* "And he’s broken! Women are scary..."

Faris: *My eyes light up with excitement, my hands clasped together.* "Is that a time machine, nya!?"

Itaru: *I scratch the back of my head, my cheeks flushed.* "I guess you could say that!"

Faris: *I bat my eyelashes at Itaru, a sly grin on my face.* "Wow! You’re awesome, nya! Your big brain makes my heart race, nyan."

Itaru: *I stammer goofily, my face turning even redder.* "You mean it? N-now I’m embarrassed, hehehe."

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, my arms crossed in exasperation.* "Dumbass. What’s with that grin?"

Faris: *I rest my chin on my hands, my eyes distant and dreamy.* "Faris dreams of going on a journey through time, nya."

Itaru: *I nod, my eyes shining with determination.* "I’ll bring you along some day."

Okabe: *I sigh, running a hand through my hair.* "Daru, don’t make promises you can’t keep."

Faris: *I tilt my head, my eyes narrowing in thought.* "By the way, it’s been bugging me, but what is time anyway, nya?"

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, caught off guard by the sudden philosophical question.* "What?"

Faris: *I lean back in my chair, my fingers tracing patterns on the table as I delve into my thoughts.* "Time is often compared to a river, nya, flowing from past to future. But is that really how it is, nya? If time is a river, then where is the present, nya? Is it a point? Is it a line? Where does the present begin and end, nya?"

Itaru: *I scratch my head, looking genuinely puzzled.* "Now that you mention it, I only have a vague concept of time. Never gave it any serious thought."

Okabe: *I lean forward, my eyes focused on Faris, my voice steady and thoughtful.* "The present is a leaf floating on the river. It moves along with the flow from past to future."

Faris: *I look at Okabe, my eyes wide with curiosity.* "So are we riding on that leaf, nya? When you die, do you fall off, nyan?"

Okabe: *I nod, my gaze steady on Faris.* "You could say that. All points upstream from the leaf are the past. Downstream, the future."

Faris: *I tap my chin, my gaze drifting off into the distance.* "Hmnya... But is that leaf only the present for humans, nya?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, intrigued by the question.* "Meaning...?"

Faris: *I lean forward, my eyes shining with curiosity.* "Humans make units to define and observe time, which is how we know this leaf is the present. But if every living thing in the universe went extinct, nothing would exist to observe the present, nya. In that case, where would the present go, nya?"

Itaru: *I shrug, looking unsure.* "Wouldn’t something like God or the will of the universe observe it?"

Faris: *I shake my head, a playful smile on my face.* "But what if God is a four-dimensional being who can freely move through time, nya?"

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by the depth of Faris's question.* "U-uh...?"

Faris: *I giggle, my eyes twinkling with mischief.* "If God is the one who decides the present, then won’t our present move with him, nya?"

Itaru: *I sigh, rubbing my temples.* "This is hard..."

Okabe: *I nod, a thoughtful look on my face.* "So what you’re saying is that the present is subjective to the observer."

Faris: *I nod, my eyes shining with excitement.* "If we go with that assumption, then the past and the future also depend on the observer, nyan. If Faris were to use a time machine to travel back one week, then Kyouma and Daru-nyan’s present would become Faris’s future, nya."
