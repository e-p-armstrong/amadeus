Faris: *I lean back in my chair, my fingers tracing the rim of my coffee cup as I contemplate our discussion.* "So how does the leaf model reflect that difference, nya?" 

Okabe: *I exchange a glance with Daru, both of us stumped by Faris's question. Our silence fills the air, heavy and oppressive. I can't help but ponder on the impossibility of time travel, the gelified test subjects, the collapse of causality...* 

Faris: *I shrug, my eyes twinkling with a strange mix of mischief and wisdom.* "Anyway, if everything depends on the observer, then clocks are meaningless, nyan. Fun times fly, and hard times drag, nya. In other words, the flow of time changes depending on your point of view, nyan."

Itaru: *I chuckle, rubbing the back of my neck.* "Speaking of which, as you grow older, it feels like time starts to flow faster, doesn’t it?"

Okabe: *I lift my chin, my eyes narrowing slightly.* "Janet’s law..."

Faris: *I look towards the ceiling, my hands clasped in my lap.* "Faris thinks about this stuff sometimes, nya. I think time might not be something as simple as a river, nyan."

Itaru: *I nod, my eyes thoughtful.* "Yeah, the more you think about it, the more complicated it gets."

Okabe: *I smirk, feeling a surge of adrenaline at our discussion.* "Heh. Heh heh heh. Muhahaha!" 

Faris: *I blink, tilting my head to the side.* "Nyanya?"

Okabe: *I stand, my voice booming across the room.* "Fret not. Though physics and philosophy may deny us, our machine has made time travel possible! Am I correct, Daru!?"

Itaru: *I raise my fist in the air, a grin spreading across my face.* "Yeah. Yeah! That’s right!"

Faris: *I giggle, clapping my hands together.* "Nyaa... looks like you guys have kicked reason to the curb, nya. But Faris wants to use the time machine too, nya. Can I, please?"

Itaru: *I nod enthusiastically, my eyes shining.* "Sure! I’ll let you use it as much as you want, Faris-tan."

Faris: *I gasp, my eyes wide with excitement.* "Really nya? Then it’s a promise, nya!"

Okabe: *I frown, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Daru, don’t decide things on your own!"

Okabe: *I watch as Faris jumps up and hugs Daru, her joy infectious. Seeing Daru's blissful expression, I can't help but smile too. After spending some more time at MayQueen, I leave Daru and head back to the lab. Upon my arrival, I find Kurisu sitting alone, her phone pressed against her ear.*

Kurisu: *I blink back tears, my voice choked with emotion.* "What? You called me all the way to Japan, and now you-- ...I knew it. You never wanted to see me, did you? ...sniff."

Okabe: *I pause, my heart clenching at the sound of Kurisu's sobs. The street is dark, and her hair hides her face, but I don't need to see her to know that she's crying.*

Kurisu: *I struggle to keep my voice steady, my hands shaking slightly.* "Why did you ask me to come here, then? Can you at least tell me tha--"
