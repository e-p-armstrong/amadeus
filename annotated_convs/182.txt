Kurisu: *I lean back in my chair, my eyes half-closed as I sigh in exasperation.* "Yeah..." *I let the word hang in the air for a moment, heavy with a mix of frustration and resignation.* "It’s the middle of summer, but instead of going on vacation, I’m stuck in this sauna with a bunch of pervs. Where did I go wrong?"

Okabe: *I smirk, my eyes twinkling with mischief as I retort,* "Wipe your tears, you experiment-loving girl without a single friend."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms defensively, my cheeks flushing slightly.* "I’m not crying! Besides, you’re the one who told us to be here."

Okabe: *I nod, a triumphant grin spreading across my face.* "Indeed. But the one who obeyed my orders and arrived on time... was you."

Mayuri: *I hum happily, my mouth full of nuggets as I chime in.* "You know, Chris-chan is actually a very honest and hardworking girl. That’s what Mayushii thinks♪" *I giggle, completely oblivious to the tension in the room.* "That’s what makes her so adorable."

Kurisu: *I blink, taken aback by Mayuri's comment.* "Eh, wha...!? How can this girl say something like that while eating a nugget..."

Itaru: *I chuckle, shaking my head as I lean back in my chair.* "A yuri flag. I get it."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, my cheeks burning.* "Please unget it."

Mayuri: *I giggle, holding out a nugget to Kurisu.* "Here, Chris-chan. Have a nugget."

Kurisu: *I hesitate, then take the nugget with a muttered,* "Th-thanks..."

Okabe: *As they continue their heartwarming banter, I make my way to the table, a bundle of freshly washed laundry in my arms. But before I can put them down--*

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, my tone sharp.* "Don’t put that there. It’s filthy."

Okabe: *I frown, my hands still gripping the bundle of clothes.* "I just washed them!"

Kurisu: *I wave a dismissive hand, my gaze unwavering.* "Like I care. What kind of guy puts his underwear in a girl’s face? Have some decency."

Okabe: *I scoff, my smirk returning.* "If you’re that interested in my underwear, then just say so."

Kurisu: *I sputter, my face reddening even further.* "Wh-wha...! I’m not interested at all!"

Mayuri: *I frown, my voice soft but firm.* "Come on, guys. No more talking about underwear. Mayushii’s trying to eat here, okay?"

Itaru: *I snort, unable to suppress a grin.* "How can you say that when you’re still shoveling nuggets into your mouth..."

Okabe: *I huff, waving them off.* "Don’t interrupt me!" *With that, I retreat to the changing room, leaving my laundry there.*

Okabe: *I return to the group, my gaze serious as I address them.* "As I explained to Daru yesterday, I’ve noticed something about the results of our experiments! D-Mails have too many uncertain variables. We can never be sure what will happen when we send one." *I clench my fists, the weight of our actions bearing down on me.*

Kurisu: *I nod, my expression thoughtful.* "It’s not like we can do anything about that. After all, the result is up to whoever receives the mail. Of course, if you can analyze the recipient’s psychology, then you might be able to manipulate them into doing what you want. Though that might be a bit too much for Hououin Underwear here."

Itaru: *I chuckle, shaking my head in amusement.* "You just wanted to say underwear, didn’t you?"

Okabe: *I ignore their banter, my tone growing more serious.* "Underwear aside, the fact is that D-Mail is still far from complete." *I pause, my gaze sweeping over each of them. The gravity of our situation hangs in the air, a stark contrast to our earlier laughter and teasing.*

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, steeling myself for what I have to say next.* "And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I called you here today. The purpose of today’s Round Table Conference is--"

Itaru: *I groan, rolling my eyes.* "Another Round Table?"

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, a hint of amusement in my voice.* "If you want a Round Table Conference that much, at least go buy a round table."

Mayuri: *I smile, my voice soft and reassuring.* "Remember what Okarin said, Chris-chan? The round table is in our hearts."

Kurisu: *I sigh, a small smile tugging at my lips.* "Mayuri-san, you’re really innocent. But you shouldn’t take everything Okabe says seriously."
