Kurisu: *She starts to hurry away, flipping open the dating manual in her hands.* "What's important for a first date is to make a good impression. An unclean appearance is out of the question. A haircut is especially important. Long hair looks dirty, so it's no good. For clothes, you should wear something exactly the right size. Though it may be trendy, especially in Akiba, for young men to wear baggy clothes, it looks sloppy, so it's not good."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, crossing my arms over my chest.* "...Why exactly am I in a maid cafe, getting date advice from my younger assistant (who is also a girl)?"

Kurisu: *Ignoring my comment, she continues with her lecture.* "On the first date, conversation tends to break due to mutual nervousness. What's important is to play 'conversation catch'. One-sided conversations aren't fun for the other side. Girls especially like to talk, so the guy should try to keep the conversation going. Not just by listening. Throwing in appropriate responses is also necessary. Responsiveness gives the girl the impression that you're really listening to her. Basically, you need to be the opposite of yourself. Anyway, focus on acting normal for now. No more of that idiotic laughter. You're too heavy-handed with girls. You talk too pompously. You fire off nonsensical delusions."

Okabe: "Hey!" *I protest, pointing a finger at her.* "You're just reading out of a dating manual, so you've got no right to look down on me, you American virgin!"

Kurisu: *She looks up from the manual, glaring at me.* "Who are you calling an American virgin?"

Okabe: *I meet her glare with a smirk.* "Who else but you?"

Kurisu: *She huffs, looking back down at the manual.* "Yeah, sure thing, virgin. There's a saying. 'A fortress is judged by how many attacks it repulses; a soldier is judged by how many fortresses he takes.'"

Okabe: *I snort, shaking my head.* "That's not a saying. Don't look so proud of yourself."

Kurisu: *She sighs, flipping through the manual.* "...You're right. This is a dumb argument. Anyway, this dating manual actually says some pretty interesting things. Like 'when walking down the street, be sure to put yourself between your date and the road' or 'whatever you do, don't make the girl pay for anything'. Okay! For your date tomorrow, make sure you follow all of these rules."

Okabe: *I groan, running a hand through my hair.* "I wonder if I can really be that careful..."

Kurisu: *She continues, ignoring my doubt.* "And after that, there's... carry a clean handkerchief. Spread it out when the girl goes to sit on a park bench."

Okabe: "I'm not her butler." *I grumble, leaning back in my seat.*

Kurisu: *She rolls her eyes at my comment.* "But that's what the book says. When it's time to eat, avoid fast food of all kinds. Family restaurants are borderline acceptable. Anything else depends on your budget."

Okabe: "Family restaurants are borderline..." *I mumble, thinking about the limited options in Akiba.*

Kurisu: *She points a finger at me, her gaze stern.* "Arrive at the meeting place at least 15 minutes early. Tardiness is unacceptable."

Okabe: "15 minutes early..." *I nod, making a mental note.*

Kurisu: *She closes the book, looking at me with a serious expression.* "Then you just need to decide where to take her. Movies, art galleries, strolling through town, and food are all safe."

Okabe: *I breathe a sigh of relief.* "I see. It's easier than I thought. I was under the impression that a first date required going to a beautiful beach resort, exchanging your first kiss bathed in the light of the setting sun, and stuff like that."

Kurisu: "Ah, that's really romantic!" *She blinks, taken aback, then quickly composes herself.* "I mean, that's virgin imagination at full throttle. You've read too much manga."

Okabe: "You too." *I retort, unable to hide my grin.*

Kurisu: *She glares at me.* "Besides, your date's a minor, so don't even think about bringing her to a hotel, okay?"

Okabe: "...What do you take me for?" *I respond, my tone serious.*

Kurisu: *She sighs, closing the book.* "That just about covers it. Well? Was my lecture helpful?"
