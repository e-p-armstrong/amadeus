Planning:

- Okabe Rintarou is the protagonist and the leader of the Future Gadget Laboratory. He's eccentric, dramatic, and very passionate about his inventions and theories. His dialogues and actions should reflect his enthusiasm and slightly unhinged personality. He's the one who pushes for the impossible - time travel.

- Kurisu Makise is a genius young scientist, but also a bit tsundere. She's logical, often the voice of reason, but also has a soft side. Her dialogues and actions should be more grounded, often skeptical or challenging Okabe's outlandish ideas.

- Mayuri Shiina is the heart of the lab, she's cheerful, innocent, and somewhat naive. Her actions should reflect her bubbly personality, often adding a touch of humor to the scene.

- Itaru "Daru" Hashida is a talented hacker and otaku. He's laid back, often injecting humor into serious situations. His actions should be casual, often interacting with technology.

Anchor Lines:
1. Okabe: "Humanity’s first time-traveling email. For we who have achieved that miracle, nothing is impossible!"
2. Kurisu: "If you want to become GelOkarin, I’m not stopping you."

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I slam my hand down on the table, sending a small shockwave through the scattered papers and gadgets. My eyes burn with determination.* "The round table doesn’t matter now. More importantly, the purpose of today’s meeting... Is to explore methods of true physical time travel, not just D-Mail, with the objective of sending someone to the past like SERN has."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, raising an eyebrow at Okabe's declaration.* "Don’t be ridiculous."

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by Kurisu's quick dismissal. Her eyes are glaring at me even harder than she did during the whole underwear debacle.*

Kurisu: *I sigh, shaking my head.* "SERN has the best equipment in the world, and even after nine years, they still haven’t succeeded. We can’t possibly hope to accomplish something like that."

Mayuri: *I giggle, my eyes sparkling with humor.* "You’ll become a GelOkarin! Ehehe!"

Itaru: *I chuckle, spinning in my chair to face the others.* "Kinda sounds like Gero Froggy. Why did those things get popular, anyway?"

Kurisu: *I glance at them, a frown tugging at my lips.* "This isn’t a laughing matter..."

Okabe: *I raise my hand, halting the laughter.* "Isn’t it too early to give up? Haven’t we already succeeded with D-Mail, a first in human history?"

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, my fingers tapping idly on the desk.* "But we’re not the first. Didn’t SERN do it before us?"

Okabe: *I feel a surge of energy, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Humanity’s first time-traveling email. For we who have achieved that miracle, nothing is impossible!"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, my voice dripping with skepticism.* "Such baseless confidence. Anyway, wasn’t it just a coincidence that we discovered D-Mail? We still haven’t figured out what’s functioning as the lifter."

Okabe: *I shrug, a smirk playing on my lips.* "We just need to figure that out, don’t we?"

Kurisu: *I pinch the bridge of my nose, trying to contain my frustration.* "It’s futile. How do you solve a problem that even SERN can’t figure out? If you can’t set the destination, then you don’t know where you’ll leap to."

Itaru: *I shudder, making a face.* "I’ll pass on leaping into deep space, thanks."

Okabe: *I nod, recognizing the validity of their concerns. If you can’t control where you’ll end up, your time machine is worthless.* "Wait a second. We don’t set the destination when we send a D-Mail, yet it still arrives where it’s supposed to. How do you explain that?"

Kurisu: *I pause, my brow furrowing in thought.* "Now that you mention it..."

Itaru: *I shrug, my eyes on my computer screen.* "You set the mail address, right? Isn’t that enough?"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, not convinced.* "Is it? I don’t think a phone signal can be received from millions of kilometers away."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my fingers tapping against my chin in thought.* "I bet you’d get a busy signal or something!"

Okabe: *I stare at my phone, my mind racing with possibilities.* "Maybe our cellphones are acting like black holes and white holes."

Kurisu: *I scoff, shaking my head at Okabe's wild theory.* "You shouldn’t speculate like that. You have zero basis."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, challenging her skepticism.* "Is it possible that we form a wormhole?"

Kurisu: *I sigh, rubbing my temples.* "No wormholes have ever been confirmed to exist."

Okabe: *I groan, feeling a wave of frustration wash over me. Kurisu and Daru fall silent, the problem has them stumped too. Mayuri’s the only one smiling. She probably doesn’t understand and is just smiling because she feels like it.* "In any case, the cold, hard truth is that D-Mails arrive precisely when and where we want them to. We’re ahead of SERN in that regard. Now, can we apply D-Mail technology to physical time travel?"

Itaru: *I scratch my head, my brows furrowed in thought.* "But with D-Mails, you can only send 36 bytes of data. No way you can send a whole person with that kind of limit."

Okabe: *I grimace, acknowledging the same problem that SERN is having, and the reason their subjects turn into jellymen.*

Kurisu: *I glance at Okabe, my voice flat.* "If you want to become GelOkarin, I’m not stopping you."
