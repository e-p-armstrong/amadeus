Kurisu: *I fold my arms, my eyes fixed on the machine in the middle of the room, my voice steady and logical.* "It would be best to leave physical transfer aside for now. Sending data through time is an amazing feat by itself. We should be satisfied with what we’ve got."

Okabe: *I chuckle, shaking my head as I lean back in my chair, my eyes twinkling with mischief.* "Such pessimism is unbecoming of a scientist sworn to uncover the secrets of the universe."

Kurisu: *I sigh, rubbing my temples as I turn to face him, my tone firm.* "I’m telling you to know your limits. If you’re going to uncover the secrets of the universe, you need personnel, equipment, and funding to rival SERN’s. It’s one thing to set lofty goals, but this impoverished lab has no resources to speak of." *I pause, looking at each of the lab members, my gaze serious.* "I’ve been thinking. Maybe we should bring the PhoneWave to a proper research institution and entrust it to a specialist. SERN’s keeping their time machine research top secret, so if we make an official announcement, it’ll benefit the future of mankind."

Okabe: *I frown, my fingers drumming on the armrest of my chair, my voice grave.* "...If we make an official announcement, the Organization will become aware of my existence."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, crossing my arms over my chest, my voice laced with frustration.* "Oh come on! I’m being serious here. This isn’t the time for your childish--"

Okabe: *I cut her off, pointing a finger towards her, my voice rising with each word.* "And we’ve hacked into SERN. Those heartless bastards will do anything, even experiment on human beings. And behind them is a power greater than all the nations of the Earth. If we make the PhoneWave (name subject to change) public, they might have us erased."

Kurisu: *I throw my hands up in exasperation, rolling my eyes.* "...You watch too many movies."

Okabe: *I lean forward, my eyes gleaming with determination, my voice firm.* "The name ’Committee of 300’ appeared in actual SERN documents."

Kurisu: *I falter, my voice weakening.* "Yeah, but..."

Mayuri: *I tug at the hem of my dress, my voice trembling slightly.* "Mayushii’s kinda scared..."

Itaru: *I glance up from my computer screen, my fingers still tapping away at the keyboard, my voice filled with fear.* "If they find out about our hacking, they’ll seriously have us killed. I didn’t make any mistakes that could give us away, of course."

Okabe: *I nod solemnly, my voice low.* "Also, and this is the biggest problem--" *I pause, looking at each one of them, my gaze serious.* "If we go public, we won’t be able to do cool stuff with D-Mails anymore!"

Kurisu: *I groan, burying my face in my hands.* "Why you..."

Okabe: *I throw my head back, laughing maniacally.* "Muhahaha! No way I’m giving up such an awesome machine! I am Hououin Kyouma! The insane mad scientist who rules space and time! What I desire is -- that’s right -- CHAOS!"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, a sigh escaping my lips.* "This guy’s hopeless. Better do something quick."

Itaru: *I blink, turning to look at her, my voice filled with confusion.* "Eh?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, my laughter subsiding.* "Hm?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my voice filled with confusion.* "Hwe?"

Kurisu: *I freeze, my eyes widening in surprise.* "Ah..."

Okabe: *I smirk, leaning forward, my voice teasing.* "Christina. Are you an @channe--"

Kurisu: *I snap, my voice sharp and cold.* "Shut up! I’m not, okay!?" *I glare at him, my eyes icy and intense.*

Okabe: *I swallow, my voice slightly shaky.* "Th-that reminds me, Daru. Have you made any progress hacking into SERN?" *I glance over at him, noticing how his fingers are always busy on the keyboard.*

Itaru: *I nod, my eyes glued to my monitor, my voice filled with pride.* "Yeah, right now I’m combing SERN’s massive database. It would take years to read it all. For now, I’ve passed everything that looks important to Makise-shi for translation. Basically, I’ve gone as deep as I can go. SERN belongs to me now."
