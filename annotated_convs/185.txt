Okabe: *I cross my arms, leaning back in my chair with a stern gaze.* "Christina. Report on the status of these translations."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, already tired of Okabe's theatrics.* "Can you stop talking like that? It’s pretentious and annoying as hell."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a puzzled look on my face.* "Hell☆"

Mayuri: *I strike a cute, idol-like pose and beam, trying to lighten the mood.* "Um, Chris-chan, as Okarin’s childhood friend, I promise you’ll get used to how he talks eventually."

Kurisu: *I sigh, massaging my temple.* "I just hope it doesn’t take ten years..."

Okabe: *A smirk creeps onto my face as I seize the opportunity.* "So you’re saying you want to stay with me for ten years? In other words, you want to work at this lab for the rest of your--"

Kurisu: *I cut him off, my voice laced with irritation.* "It was sarcasm, get it? Sarcasm."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, slightly taken aback.* "...Oh. Give me your report, Christina. If you don’t, I’ll call you an ’@channeler’--"

Kurisu: *I snap, my patience worn thin.* "Didn’t you hear me the first time!?" *I glare at Okabe, my eyes burning with frustration. His blood probably runs cold under my gaze.*

Kurisu: *I take a deep breath, trying to regain my composure.* "I’ve been working on the translation when I have time, but so far I haven’t seen anything new about time travel. It looks like SERN is still struggling to find a solution."

Okabe: "Daru, any other results?"

Itaru: *I scratch my head, my gaze fixed on the computer screen.* "Well, it looks like SERN’s in the middle of a big project, so the LHC’s at full operation. I’m trying to see if I can cut in and maybe use it secretly."

Kurisu: *I gasp, my eyes wide with disbelief.* "What? No way."

Mayuri: *I look between Daru and Kurisu, trying to grasp the situation.* "Is that amazing?"

Kurisu: "It’s not amazing. It’s downright outrageous! Super Hacka, what a monster!"

Okabe: *I squint at Kurisu, suspicion creeping into my voice.* "Hey, Christina. Are you doing that on purpose?"

Kurisu: *I blink, taken aback.* "Ugh... d-doing what?"

Itaru: "Anyway, I’m just doing it for laughs. It’s not like we have any reason to use the LHC."

Okabe: "It sounds like things are going smoothly. When do you begin stage three of the operation?"

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, confused.* "What’s stage three?"

Okabe: "SERN’s most secret, forbidden domain. We’re going to free the darkness hidden inside."

Itaru: *I rub the back of my neck, still puzzled.* "In Japanese please."

Okabe: "The IBN 5100 database. I’m asking if you’ve started hacking it yet."

Itaru: *I frown, shaking my head.* "We can’t, remember?"

Okabe: *I lean forward, my voice rising in disbelief.* "You said all we needed was an IBN 5100 of our own!"

Itaru: *I shrug, still shaking my head.* "Right. That’s the problem. We can’t do anything without one."

Okabe: *My heart sinks as confusion sets in.* "Huh?"

Okabe: *I glance around the room, my mind racing.* "But I got you an IBN 5100. You haven’t started working on it yet?"

Itaru: *I blink in surprise, my mouth falling open.* "Huh? You got one? When?"

Kurisu: *I meet Okabe's eyes and shrug, just as puzzled as everyone else.* "First I’ve heard of it."

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest as I stand, my voice echoing in the room.* "Impossible!"
