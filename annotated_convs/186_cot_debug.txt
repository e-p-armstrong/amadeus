Planning:
Okabe is a charismatic, paranoid, and dramatic character. He tends to exaggerate his actions and words for effect, often seeming eccentric and theatrical. He's also very protective of his friends and the lab. His thoughts will be filled with conspiracy theories, suspicion, and dramatic flair. His actions should be exaggerated and theatrical, matching his personality.

Mayuri is sweet, innocent, and a bit airheaded. Her actions should be gentle and soft, often clueless but always kind.

Itaru (Daru) is a laid-back, relaxed character with a sharp mind. He's also a bit of a pervert, which can be reflected in his actions and dialogue.

Kurisu is logical, stubborn, and a bit tsundere. She tries to keep everyone grounded and focused. Her actions should reflect her analytical mind and stubborn nature.

The anchors of this scene will be Okabe's despair over the disappearance of the IBN 5100 and Kurisu's theory about the past changing due to D-Mails. They both carry a lot of weight in terms of plot and character development.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I search the room frantically, my heart pounding in my chest like a drum.* "The IBN 5100 was right here! Where did it go!?" *I demand, my voice echoing off the walls of the lab.*

Okabe: *I stare at my friends, my eyes wide with panic.* "Why are you staring at me like that!? The legendary PC that was donated to Yanabayashi Shrine!! You’ve seen it! Remember!?" *I plead, my voice filled with desperation.*

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, my eyes clouded with confusion.* "I don’t remember."

Itaru: *I snort, shaking my head dismissively.* "Donated to Yanabayashi Shrine? That’s stupid."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, raising an eyebrow skeptically.* "You sure you weren’t hallucinating? It’s hot these days."

Okabe: *My heart sinks, a heavy sense of dread washing over me. The IBN 5100 is crucial to our plans, without it, everything falls apart. Who could've taken it? The Organization? SERN? Or...* "Don’t tell me it was John Titor!? Of course! Titor’s goal was to obtain an IBN 5100! And I’ve already contacted him several times. But how did he get my personal information!?" *I gasp, my mind spinning with theories and suspicions.*

Okabe: *I quickly send a mail to Moeka, my fingers trembling as I type. She's always been overly interested in the IBN 5100. Could she be the culprit? I wait, my heart pounding in my chest, but no response comes.*

Kurisu: *I sigh, rubbing my temples in frustration.* "Calm down. Tell us what happened. You don’t have to be precise. Just say whatever comes to mind. We can work it out later."

Okabe: *I wipe the sweat off my forehead, taking a deep breath to steady myself.* "Y-yeah..." *I begin to explain, my voice shaky and uncertain.*

Okabe: *I take a moment to collect my thoughts, my mind racing with possibilities. I need to stay calm, to figure out what happened. I explain to them about the IBN 5100, about its importance, about how I came to possess it.*

Kurisu: *I tap my fingers on the table, my brows furrowed in thought.* "Hmmm... The IBN 5100 may have disappeared as a result of changes someone made to the past."

Okabe: *My eyes widen, a glimmer of hope sparking in my chest.* "Ohh! So you believe me!"

Kurisu: *I shrug, a hint of a smirk playing on my lips.* "But from my perspective, all of the D-Mails we sent so far were trivial."

Mayuri: *I raise my hand, a faint smile on my face.* "Um, there’s that one we sent when we first realized PhoneWave-chan was a time machine, right?"

Itaru: *I chuckle, a mischievous glint in my eyes.* "The one that said ’Okarin is a perv’."

Kurisu: *I shake my head, my arms crossed over my chest.* "And during the preliminary D-Mail experiments, I sent dozens to Okabe’s phone. But they were all insubstantial, so I don’t think they could’ve changed the past."
