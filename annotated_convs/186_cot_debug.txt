Okabe: *While they discuss what to do, I sigh and consider the situation, rubbing my temples.* "This isn't going to work."

Luka: *In a soft, comforting voice, Luka tries to lighten the mood.* "Um, Okabe-san. I don't really understand, but please don't be sad. J-just go 'It matters not!' like you always do."

Okabe: *I chuckle at Luka's innocent attempt to cheer me up.* "You're using that phrase wrong, you know."

Okabe: *Exiting the shrine, I wave goodbye to Luka before turning my thoughts back to the D-Mail problem.* 

Mayuri: *She lets out a satisfied sigh, placing her chopsticks down.* "Phew. I'm stuffed! I barely ate today, so I was hungry!" 

Kurisu: *She raises an eyebrow at Mayuri's comment, her curiosity piqued.* "Is there more tomorrow?"

Mayuri: *Nodding, she starts packing up her belongings.* "Yeah, and the day after, too."

Okabe: *I watch as Mayuri prepares to leave, lost in my thoughts.* 

Mayuri: *She stretches before turning to us with a cheerful smile.* "Okeydokey! Mayushii's got an early day tomorrow, so I'm going home."

Okabe: *I shake my head at her invitation, but turn to Kurisu with a teasing grin.* "I'll pass, but my assistant looks like she wants to go."

Kurisu: *She jumps up at my answer, her face flushed in surprise.* "What!? Hey! Don't put words in my mouth!"

Okabe: *I smirk, enjoying her reaction.* "I saw your eyes sparkling while you listened to Mayuri's cosplay stories."

Kurisu: *She crosses her arms over her chest, trying to hide her interest.* "Maybe, but nobody said anything about going."
