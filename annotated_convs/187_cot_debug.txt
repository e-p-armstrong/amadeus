Planning:

In this scene, we have several characters: Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, Itaru, and Luka. 

- Okabe is the main character, a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He's eccentric, dramatic, and often confused or overwhelmed by the changes in the timeline. His actions and thoughts should reflect his larger-than-life personality, as well as his constant struggle to understand and control the changes in the timeline.
- Kurisu is a genius neuroscientist. She's usually calm, composed, and analytical. Her actions and thoughts should reflect her logical and scientific approach to things, as well as her occasional frustration with Okabe's antics.
- Mayuri is Okabe's childhood friend. She's sweet, naive, and often clueless about the scientific discussions. Her actions and thoughts should reflect her cheerful and innocent personality.
- Itaru is a hardcore otaku and a talented hacker. He's laid-back, easygoing, and often makes light of serious situations. His actions and thoughts should reflect his casual approach to things.
- Luka is a shy and timid character. He's often nervous and easily flustered. His actions and thoughts should reflect his timid and sensitive personality.

As for the anchor lines, I'll choose Okabe's line when he remembers the date he last saw the IBN 5100 and his line when he discovers that Luka doesn't remember the events surrounding the IBN 5100. These are pivotal moments in the scene, and they both reveal Okabe's struggle with the changing timeline.

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I cross my arms and raise an eyebrow, my gaze steady on Okabe.* "There was one more. The first mail Okabe accidentally sent that said I was dead."

Okabe: *I raise a hand to my chin, my eyes lost in thought.* "But from my perspective, we sent several more."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head in confusion, my fingers fiddling with the hem of my dress.* "You mean how you sent the winning LOTO SIX numbers? And how Luka-chan bought a ticket with those numbers, but didn’t win?"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, a hint of annoyance flickering in my eyes.* "But nobody aside from Okabe remembers him sending it."

Okabe: *I pull out my phone, scrolling through the messages with a frown.* "But I showed you guys afterwards. It was still in my phone’s arrival history."

Itaru: *I sigh, rubbing the back of my neck.* "We were so close."

Mayuri: *I blink, a puzzled expression on my face.* "Is that all?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, my eyes serious.* "No. There’s more. Moeka and Lukako each sent a D-Mail."

Kurisu: *I narrow my eyes, my lips pressed into a thin line.* "Oh, right. That’s what you claim, but Hashida, Mayuri-san, and I don’t remember either of those."

Mayuri: *I rub my temples, a small frown on my face.* "Owww... Mayushii’s getting a headache..."

Okabe: *I sigh, running a hand through my hair.* "I already told you guys. I’m the only one who keeps his memories after the world changes."

Kurisu: *I lean forward, my gaze piercing.* "So according to your perspective, when did the IBN 5100 disappear? Did it just happen? When’s the last time you remember seeing it in the lab?"

Okabe: *I pause, my heart pounding in my chest as I try to recall.* "Well..."

Okabe: *My eyes flutter shut as I delve deep into my memories, trying to piece together the fragmented timeline.* "I’m sure... it was August 3rd. I remember it being in the lab on August 3rd."

Kurisu: *I lean back, studying Okabe with a skeptical gaze.* "Are you certain?"

Okabe: *I swallow, my fingers gripping the fabric of my lab coat.* "I... think so."

Okabe: *I reach for my phone, dialing Lukako's number with shaking fingers. I hold my breath as I wait for him to pick up.* 

Luka: "Hello, Okabe-san. Um... p-please forget what you saw the other day..."

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by his request.* "I saw something?"

Luka: "My... cosplay..."

Okabe: *I chuckle, shaking my head at his embarrassment.* "More importantly, I have questions about the IBN 5100."

Luka: "The... eyebeam... five?"

Okabe: "IBN 5100. About nine years ago, someone dedicated a retro PC to Yanabayashi Shrine. That’s the one. Know anything?"

Luka: "Y-yes."

Okabe: *I lean forward, my heart pounding in anticipation.* "Just a while ago, I came to the shrine looking for it, didn’t I!? And then I asked your old man and he let me borrow it. Right!?"

Luka: "Eh...? I don’t..."

Okabe: *I swallow, a sinking feeling in my stomach.* "...Right?"

Luka: "I don’t remember anything like that..."

Okabe: *My heart drops, my hand gripping the phone tighter.* "The IBN 5100 was at the shrine though, right? Is it there now?"

Luka: "Um... I don’t know the details..."

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, frustration bubbling up inside me.* "Where are you now? Is your old man there?"
