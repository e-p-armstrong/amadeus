Roleplay:

Okabe: *I run a hand through my hair, my gaze darting around the room, the weight of the situation pressing down on me.* "...Damn. Okay. Sorry for calling you so suddenly."

Luka: *I stutter, my voice barely above a whisper, my hands nervously fiddling with the hem of my shirt.* "N-no problem. I’m sorry that I couldn’t help.."

Okabe: *I clench my fist, my heart pounding in my chest. I need to check the shrine, to see if the IBN 5100 is still there. But the idea of it sprouting legs and returning on its own... it's absurd, isn't it? Yet, considering the strange events happening around me, it doesn't seem entirely impossible. I shake my head, trying to clear my thoughts.* "Mayuri, I need to contact Faris."

Mayuri: *I blink, looking up from the eclair I've been nibbling on.* "Hweh?"

Mayuri: *I hold out the eclair towards Okabe, a bright smile spreading across my face.* "Want one, Okarin? They’re delicious♪"

Okabe: *I stare at them, disbelief washing over me. They're all eating, oblivious to the gravity of the situation.* "You people don’t have a care in the world, do you!? There’s some crazy stuff happening here!"

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, a hint of skepticism in my gaze.* "Or it could all just be in your head. No need to panic."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my fingers playing with a strand of my hair.* "You need Feris-chan for something? I wonder if she’s working today."

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, a smirk on my face.* "Faris-tan’s off today."

Okabe: *I shoot Daru a pointed look, rolling my eyes at his obsession with Faris.* "You know her phone number, right? See if you can get ahold of her."

Mayuri: *I nod, pulling out my phone with a cheerful smile.* "Okay!"

Mayuri: *I hold the phone to my ear, my eyes lighting up as I hear Faris' voice.* "Feris-chan? Good afternyan-nyan♪ It’s Mayushii, nyan♪"

Kurisu: *I blink, a puzzled look crossing my face.* "Nya, nyan...?"

Mayuri: *I giggle, my voice filled with warmth.* "Sorry to bother you on your day off. Okarin said he wants to talk to you about something. Wanna talk to him? Huh? You know. Okarin! ...Kyouma? Who’s Kyouma?"

Okabe: *I snatch the phone from Mayuri, my heart pounding in my chest. Faris' face is displayed on the screen, her usual cat ears in place even on her day off. I take a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves.* "It’s me. Hououin Kyouma."

Faris: *I giggle, my voice filled with amusement.* "Nyao♪ How unusual for Kyouma to contact me, nya."
