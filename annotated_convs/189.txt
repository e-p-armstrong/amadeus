Faris: *I tilt my head, a playful smile dancing on my lips.* "Nyan."

Okabe: *I blink in confusion, a frown creasing my brow.* "What? What’s ’nyan’ supposed to mean, nya?" *I groan inwardly as I realize I've started mimicking her.*

UNSPOKEN: *I hear a burst of laughter from Kurisu, who must've heard my unintended imitation.*

Faris: *I chuckle, my eyes twinkling with amusement.* "It means you’re right, nya. Though I didn’t know it was called the IBN 5100 until recently, nya."

Okabe: *I lean forward, intrigued.* "What? Why recently?"

Faris: *I shrug nonchalantly.* "Daru-nyan told me, nya."

Okabe: *I rub my chin thoughtfully, mulling over the new information.* "So that’s it... At any rate, Faris has confirmed that the IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine. So did the IBN 5100 disappear from the lab after I retrieved it? No, Kurisu and the others lost their memories of me bringing it back to the lab. So I’m considering two possibilities: One. I went to the shrine, but didn’t acquire the IBN 5100. It’s still at the shrine. Two. Before I went to the shrine, someone moved the IBN 5100 somewhere else. Looks like I’ll have to go to the shrine after all."

Faris: *I tilt my head to the side, curiosity piqued.* "So what about the retro PC, nya?"

Okabe: *I wave my hand dismissively, trying to divert her curiosity.* "Ah, nothing..."

Okabe: *I squint at Faris, a thought crossing my mind.* "Do you have any other information on the IBN 5100? It’s a super rare PC. As a charisma-build maid, I expect you have a strong network in Akiba, correct? I’d like you to use that network and search for any IBN 5100s in Akiba now."

Okabe: *I sigh, realizing the daunting task at hand.* "We only need to find one. It doesn’t matter if it’s the one I found at the shrine."

Faris: *I grin mischievously, my eyes glinting with a playful challenge.* "Hmnya... I can look. But for a price, nya."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, intrigued and slightly wary.* "A price?"

Okabe: *I lean back, arms crossed, trying to gauge her intentions.* "...Let’s hear it."

Faris: *I lean in closer, my eyes sparkling with excitement.* "I want you to come over to Faris’s apartment, nya."

Okabe: *I scratch my head, slightly taken aback.* "Where is this apartment of yours?"

Okabe: *I quickly pull out a memo pad, jotting down the address Faris recites.*

Okabe: *I nod, realizing the convenience of her location.* "Oh, so you live in Akiba."

Okabe: *I stand up, feeling a sense of urgency.* "I’ll be waiting, nyan♪"

Okabe: *I glance over my shoulder, a frown creasing my brow.* "...Well?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, noticing the unexpected company.* "Why are you guys tagging along?"

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together excitedly.* "Mayushii’s never been to Feris-chan’s place. I thought I’d like to visit once. Hehe♪"

Itaru: *I grin, rubbing my hands together in anticipation.* "I mean, it’s Faris-tan’s home. No way I’m missing this."
