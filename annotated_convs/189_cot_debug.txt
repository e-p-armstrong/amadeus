Okabe: "Time leap..." *I murmur to myself, a sense of dread creeping over me as I stare at the machine.*

Okabe: *A sudden realization hits me as I look up at the second floor window.* "Electrical discharge!?" *I bolt towards the lab, my heart pounding in my chest.* 

Okabe: *I quickly survey the room, my eyes falling on the Time Leap Machine. It's still faintly warm.* "This is the first time someone else has used the Time Leap Machine." *I mumble to myself, a sense of unease settling over me.*

Okabe: *I stand still for a moment, my hand on the headgear. The weight of my decision presses down on me.* "Should I really leap now?" *My voice is barely a whisper, the question hanging in the air.*

Okabe: *I close my phone, taking a deep breath to steady myself.* "There's no need to rush. Calm down." 

Okabe: *I continue to ponder, my mind racing with possibilities and scenarios. The ticking of the clock becomes a constant, haunting echo in my head, driving home the reality of my situation.*

Okabe: "In other words... I have nothing." *I scoff at my own helplessness, the reality of the situation sinking in.*

Okabe: *I glance at the clock, my heart sinking as I realize it's 7:46 PM.* "The moment of truth." *I mutter under my breath, my hands clenching into fists by my side.*

Okabe: *Suddenly, the silence of the lab is shattered by the ringing of my phone.* "Hello!?" *I answer hurriedly, my voice filled with a desperate hope.*

Kurisu: "Okabe! She's... aah... why... I don't..." *Her voice is filled with panic and confusion, adding to the mounting tension.*
