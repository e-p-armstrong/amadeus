Okabe: *Watching Moeka's face twist into a frown, I feel a pang of uncertainty.* "You... don’t remember, do you?" *I question her, my voice a mixture of desperation and disbelief.*

Moeka: *I shake my head slowly, my fingers already moving to type on my phone. My eyes are downcast, avoiding Okabe's gaze.*

Okabe: *A knot forms in my stomach as I watch her. Could it be possible that she truly doesn't remember? But then, who...?* "I’m sorry, Finger." *The words tumble out before I can stop them, and I find myself squatting in front of her, bowing my head in regret.* "I suspected you. A lab mem! A comrade! I’m the worst sort of man. Hit me, please. I don’t mind. But there’s one thing I want you to know." *I lift my head, the weight of my past heavy in my eyes.* "In my long years running from the Organization, I’ve grown unable to trust anyone. Once I start to suspect, everyone looks suspicious. No matter how many comrades gather around me, I always feel alone. Pitiful, aren’t I? D-did you just ignore my entire speech?"

Itaru: *I give Okabe a skeptical look.* "Hey, Okarin. You’re doing improv in the middle of the street. Has the heat gone to your head?"

Okabe: *A sigh escapes my lips as I consider the situation. I feel further from the truth than ever before.* "Wh...at?" *My attention snaps to Mayuri, my eyes wide in disbelief at her words.*

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my fingers tapping against my chin in thought.* "Sure I have!"

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest, my hands instinctively reaching out to grip Mayuri's shoulders.* "When!?"

Mayuri: *I squeal in surprise as Okabe shakes me, my words coming out in a jumbled mess.* "Ummmmm? When youuuuu brouuuught herrrr toooo theeee laaaaab!"

Okabe: *My mind races as I try to piece together the puzzle.* "I did...? Daru. Do you remember her?"

Itaru: *I shrug, not bothering to look up from my computer.* "Sure. We met at the lab."

Okabe: *My mind spirals into confusion. How could this be possible? What does it mean?* "Okarin? We need to get going. Faris-chan’s waiting, remember?"

Mayuri: *I gently tug at Okabe's sleeve, my voice a gentle reminder.*
