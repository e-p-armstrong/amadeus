Plan/Thoughts/Brainstorming:

Okabe: Okabe is a paranoid character, often wrapped up in his delusions of being hunted by an organization. His actions and thoughts should reflect this paranoia and dramatic flair, with sweeping gestures and intense inner monologues.

Moeka: Moeka is a quiet, introverted character who communicates primarily through her phone. She tends to avoid eye contact and prefers to keep to herself. Her actions should be minimal and her reactions subdued.

Mayuri: Mayuri is a cheerful and carefree character. She is quite optimistic and supportive, often bringing a light-heartedness to the intense situations. Her actions should be bubbly and animated.

Itaru: Itaru is a laid-back character, often serving as the voice of reason in Okabe's dramatic escapades. He should have relaxed actions and a sarcastic tone in his dialogue.

Anchor Lines: 
1. Okabe's apology to Moeka and his subsequent inner monologue about his paranoia. 
2. Okabe's confusion and shock when Mayuri casually mentions knowing Moeka.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *Watching Moeka's face twist into a frown, I feel a pang of uncertainty.* "You... don’t remember, do you?" *I question her, my voice a mixture of desperation and disbelief.*

Moeka: *I shake my head slowly, my fingers already moving to type on my phone. My eyes are downcast, avoiding Okabe's gaze.*

Okabe: *A knot forms in my stomach as I watch her. Could it be possible that she truly doesn't remember? But then, who...?* "I’m sorry, Finger." *The words tumble out before I can stop them, and I find myself squatting in front of her, bowing my head in regret.* "I suspected you. A lab mem! A comrade! I’m the worst sort of man. Hit me, please. I don’t mind. But there’s one thing I want you to know." *I lift my head, the weight of my past heavy in my eyes.* "In my long years running from the Organization, I’ve grown unable to trust anyone. Once I start to suspect, everyone looks suspicious. No matter how many comrades gather around me, I always feel alone. Pitiful, aren’t I? D-did you just ignore my entire speech?"

Itaru: *I give Okabe a skeptical look.* "Hey, Okarin. You’re doing improv in the middle of the street. Has the heat gone to your head?"

Okabe: *A sigh escapes my lips as I consider the situation. I feel further from the truth than ever before.* "Wh...at?" *My attention snaps to Mayuri, my eyes wide in disbelief at her words.*

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my fingers tapping against my chin in thought.* "Sure I have!"

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest, my hands instinctively reaching out to grip Mayuri's shoulders.* "When!?"

Mayuri: *I squeal in surprise as Okabe shakes me, my words coming out in a jumbled mess.* "Ummmmm? When youuuuu brouuuught herrrr toooo theeee laaaaab!"

Okabe: *My mind races as I try to piece together the puzzle.* "I did...? Daru. Do you remember her?"

Itaru: *I shrug, not bothering to look up from my computer.* "Sure. We met at the lab."

Okabe: *My mind spirals into confusion. How could this be possible? What does it mean?* "Okarin? We need to get going. Faris-chan’s waiting, remember?"

Mayuri: *I gently tug at Okabe's sleeve, my voice a gentle reminder.*
