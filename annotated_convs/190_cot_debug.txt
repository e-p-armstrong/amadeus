Okabe: *With a sigh of frustration, I reach out to Moeka again, only to have my hand brushed away.* "...Dammit." *I mutter.*

Moeka: "...uugh..." *She mumbles, her eyes glazed over and unresponsive.*

Okabe: *Suddenly, my phone rings, startling me. I quickly check the caller ID - it's Kurisu.* "Hello?" *I answer, moving to the entrance of the room to keep Moeka in my sight.*

Kurisu: "Finally. Where are you?" *She asks, her tone impatient.*

Okabe: "...Sorry, I'm busy." *I respond, my eyes never leaving Moeka.*

Kurisu: "Is it a woman? You're with a woman, aren't you?" *She teases.*

Okabe: "Is that the first thing that comes to mind? You really are a mainstream girl." *I retort, a hint of amusement in my voice.*

Kurisu: "Shut up. You promised you'd help with the PhoneWave, remember? Or is your lab mem number just for show?" *She scolds.*

Okabe: "Get Daru to help. I can't do it today." *I say, my gaze returning to Moeka.*

Kurisu: "...What are you doing? Where are you?" *She asks, her curiosity piqued.*

Okabe: "Kiryu Moeka's apartment." *I respond, watching as Moeka starts typing out another email.*

Kurisu: "So you are with a woman. You're the worst." *She groans.*

Okabe: *I quickly explain the situation to Kurisu, keeping an eye on Moeka as I talk.* "You've seen too many Hollywood movies." *I retort when she suggests using force against Moeka.*

Kurisu: "You're up against an agent of SERN. Play nice and you could end up dead. Don't hesitate. Remember you're doing this to save Mayuri. I know you're pretty weak and scrawny, but you should be able to handle her in her current state." *She insists, her voice low.*

Okabe: "You're a monster. But you're not a hypocrite, and that's what I love about you, Christina." *I reply, my voice filled with a mix of admiration and resignation.*

Kurisu: "L-love!? Uh..." *She stammers, clearly taken aback by my words.*

Okabe: "I mean it. I wish my conviction were as strong as yours." *I say, my gaze returning to Moeka, who's still engrossed in her phone.*

Kurisu: "...Well, thanks." *She responds, her tone softening.*
