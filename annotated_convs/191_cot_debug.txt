Planning:
Characters:
1. Itaru: He's a cheerful, otaku character who's passionate about Faris, the maid at a café.
2. Okabe: The main character, he's eccentric and dramatic, and always ready to jump into conspiracy theories.
3. Mayuri: She's innocent, cheerful, and sometimes naïve.

Writing styles:
1. Itaru: His actions will involve a lot of emotional responses, like covering ears or sudden exclamations.
2. Okabe: His actions will be dramatic and often exaggerated, along with his paranoid thoughts.
3. Mayuri: Her actions will be simple and sweet, often reflecting her innocence.

The anchor lines would be Okabe's realization about Faris' real identity and their reaction upon reaching Faris' home. The former would have a tone of surprise and acceptance, while the latter would be full of awe and disbelief.

Roleplay:
Itaru: *I gasp, my eyes wide with shock.* "Whoa, Okarin! Hold on there! Faris-tan’s name is Faris NyanNyan. She doesn’t have any other names!"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a smirk playing on my lips.* "Face reality, Daru. Faris NyanNyan is just her professional name."

Itaru: *I cringe, covering my ears as if to block out his words.* "Uwahh, you’re the worst! Why do you have to crush my dreams like that, man?"

Okabe: *I roll my eyes at his dramatics, my arms crossed in front of my chest.* "Quit grumbling. You just can’t handle the truth!" *I turn to Mayuri, my gaze softening.* "Well, Mayuri? Don’t you know?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, pondering.* "Hmmm, is it okay for Mayushii to tell you?"

Okabe: *I chuckle, waving a dismissive hand.* "It’s not like you took a vow of secrecy, right? And besides, we’re visiting her home, so we’ll find out soon enough."

Mayuri: *I nod, biting my lower lip.* "Oh. I guess you’re right... But just promise me you’ll keep it secret, okay? Like from the masters who come to MayQueen."

Okabe: *I give her a firm nod.* "I promise."

Mayuri: *I take a deep breath, preparing to reveal the secret.* "Okay. Feris-chan’s real name is Akiha Rumiho-chan!"

Itaru: *I scream, my hands pressed hard against my ears.* "Nyah nyah nyah, not listening!"

Okabe: *I mutter the name under my breath.* "Akiha..." *A realization dawns on me.* The same characters as in Akihabara. Appropriate. *I glance at the high-rise apartment building next to UPX, our destination.* "Our destination turns out to be this high-rise apartment building next to UPX."

Mayuri: *I gasp, my eyes sparkling with awe.* "Waahh... awwwesome..."

Itaru: *I blink, taken aback.* "Wait... seriously?"

Okabe: *I swallow, my eyes scanning the towering building.* "She lives... here?" *We stand there for a while, staring wide-eyed at the towering building before us.* "Did we get the wrong address?" *I shake my head.* No. I wouldn’t make such a stupid mistake. *My mind quickly jumps to the worst-case scenario.* "Don’t tell me Faris is working for the Organization!?" *I quickly scan the area. No suspicious figures in sight.* "Does she have men in black waiting to haul us off to a re-education camp!?"

Itaru: *I laugh, shaking my head at his imagination.* "Nice delusion, man. The truth is stranger than fiction. Besides, don’t you think it would be super moe if Faris-tan turned out to be a ’rich girl’ character?"

Okabe: *I scoff, rolling my eyes.* "Nice delusion yourself, man."

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes wide and bright with anticipation.* "Anyway, let’s go in!"

Okabe: *As we call the top floor room via intercom, we’re greeted by the voice of an elderly man. He lets us in immediately once I introduce myself as Hououin Kyouma. It feels like we’re walking into a trap, but I can’t turn back now. When we get off the elevator, the elderly man from the intercom is there to lead us inside. He turns out to be a silver-haired gentleman in a tuxedo.*

Mayuri: *I gasp, my eyes wide with fascination.* "A real live butler..."

Butler: *I bow, my voice calm and professional.* "Mistress. Mr. Hououin Kyouma and friends have arrived."

Okabe: *We're led into a room, where Faris is standing before a large window with a panoramic view of Akiba.* 

Faris: *I turn to the butler, a soft smile on my face.* "Thanks, Kuroki nya."
