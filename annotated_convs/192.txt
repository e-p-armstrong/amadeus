Moeka: *Her face twists in pain and she struggles to escape my grasp.* "Gehh, gehhehuggehgehoh--"

Okabe: *My guillotine choke seems to be working. She doesn't have the strength to resist. I tighten my grip, her resistance wanes and I manage to pry the phone from her clenched hand.* 

Okabe: *Suddenly, I release her and step away.* "Gehohgehohgehoh, khah, ga... beh.. gh..." *I hear her coughing violently behind me, but I'm already engrossed in the task of operating her phone.*

Okabe: *Startled, I look up to see Moeka staggering to her feet. Without a second thought, I sprint outside, slamming the door behind me. Leaning my entire body weight onto it so she can't open it from the inside, I hear the doorknob rattle as she tries to open the door, then the sound of her pounding on the inside. I need to send the cancellation D-Mail, I need to change the past.* 

Okabe: *I dial Kurisu's number, holding the phone against my ear with my shoulder as my hands busy themselves with typing the crucial message into Moeka's phone.* "Get ready for a D-Mail!" 

Kurisu: *Her voice comes through clearly on the other end.* "Okay, but what's that noise!?" 

Okabe: "I'm having a little trouble here." 

Kurisu: "So you didn't kill her. Good job!" 

Okabe: *I tell her Moeka's address.* "And Mayuri?" 

Kurisu: "Still here. She's at the Braun Tube Workshop trying to get the manager to turn on the CRT. You didn't tell her anything, did you?" 

Okabe: "About her death? Of course not." 

Kurisu: "Good. Don't hang up yet." 

Okabe: *I put my phone down and resume typing into Moeka's phone. I glance up as a middle-aged lady steps out of the apartment next door. I offer a forced smile, which she returns before retreating back inside. With the pounding and groaning from the other side of the door growing louder, I finish typing the D-Mail and hit send.* 

Okabe: *A moment of silence, and then confusion.* "...?" 

Okabe: *I bring my own phone back to my ear.* "Well!?" 

Kurisu: "Did you send it?" 

Okabe: "Yes. Did it work!?" 

Kurisu: "The discharge is occurring as normal."
