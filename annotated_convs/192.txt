Mayuri: *I look at Faris with a bright smile, my hands clasped together in greeting.* "Feris-chan, good afternyan-nyan♪"

Itaru: *My eyes light up at the sight of Faris, and I let out a sigh of admiration.* "Mhmm, casual Faris-tan... too cute!"

Okabe: *I quickly interrupt Daru's drooling by jabbing my elbow into his ribs.* "They followed me. If you don’t want them here, I’ll send them home."

Faris: *I wave my hand dismissively, a playful smile on my lips.* "No fur off my back, nya. Everyone’s welcome nyan♪"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, perplexed by her manner of speaking.* "Wait, you talk like that even in your own home?"

Faris: *I tilt my head, feigning confusion.* "What do you mean, nya?"

Okabe: *I cross my arms over my chest, giving her a stern look.* "Gonna play dumb, Akiha Rumiho?"

Faris: *I stick my tongue out playfully.* "Faris is Faris, nya."

Okabe: *I let out a sigh of frustration, running a hand through my hair.* "Fine. What I really want to know is how you get to live in a luxury apartment in Akiba’s best district!" *I take another look around the room, my eyes scanning the elegant and pristine interior. The place is so clean and well-maintained that it feels more like a model home than a lived-in apartment.*

Okabe: *I turn back to Faris, my gaze intense.* "Faris... just who are you?"

Faris: *I giggle, twirling a lock of my hair around my finger.* "Like I said, Faris is Faris, nyan."

Okabe: *I slam my hand on the table, the noise echoing in the room.* "Don’t play dumb. If you don’t explain yourself, I’m leaving!"

Itaru: *I look at Okabe in disbelief, my eyes wide behind my glasses.* "H-how arrogant... we’re the ones who came here to ask Faris-tan for a favor, aren’t we?"

Faris: *I pause for a moment, my playful demeanor fading.* "Hmmya... Well, if you must know... This land originally belonged to my family, nya."

Okabe: *My eyes widen in shock, and I sputter out a single word.* "Hah?"

Mayuri: *I gasp, my hands flying up to cover my mouth.* "Oh! So that’s why you’re Akiha-san!"

Okabe: *The realization hits me like a punch to the gut.* "Akiha... You mean you’re descended from the hereditary landholders of Akihabara!?" 

Faris: *I nod, my eyes sparkling with a certain pride.* "By the way, Faris has considerable influence on Akihabara’s development, nyan." 

Faris: *I perform a cute gesture, mimicking a cat washing its face.* "It was Faris who convinced the development board to actively promote moe culture in Akiba, nya."

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes wide with admiration.* "Wow! That’s amazing!"

Faris: "I’ve been going to development meetings since I was little, nya." *I say this with a nonchalant shrug, as if it's the most normal thing in the world.*

Faris: *I suddenly become serious, my playful demeanor disappearing.* "But please keep all this a secret, nyan."

Okabe: *I frown, intrigued by her sudden change in tone.* "Why?"

Faris: *I look at Okabe, a mysterious glint in my eyes.* "You wanna know, nya?"
