Faris: *I smile coyly, my fingers gently tracing the contours of Okabe's cheek.* "That’s because..." *I pause for dramatic effect, grinning at the bewildered look on Okabe's face.* "Faris is Faris, nya♪"

Okabe: *I reel back, both infuriated and entranced by the enchanting catgirl before me.* "Damn you, catgirl! How DARE you make a fool of me!?" 

Faris: *I bat my eyelashes innocently, a playful smile tugging at the corners of my lips.* "I want all my fans to keep treating me the same as always, nyan☆"

Itaru: *I can't help but pump my fist in the air, completely captivated by Faris's charm.* "I’ll treat you! I’ll treat you at full force!"

Mayuri: *I chime in, clapping my hands together with genuine admiration.* "Mayushii’s your fan too! Your maid spirit is really amazing!"

Okabe: *I cross my arms, doing my best to hide my own vulnerability.* "I don’t care about any of this!" *I point an accusatory finger at Faris.* "Do not defy me, Faris NyanNyan, or I’ll paint your expensive wallpaper with blood. You called me to your home so you could show off your status and try to gain leverage in our negotiations. But it’s futile. For you are dealing with the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!"

Itaru: *I blink in disbelief, my excitement quickly fading.* "What kind of reason is that..."

Faris: *I giggle, leaning in closer to Okabe.* "Nyan♪ Faris loves forceful men, nyan."

Itaru: *I stutter, completely taken aback.* "What... did she say?"

Okabe: *I smirk, expecting Faris to cower in fear. Instead, her eyes sparkle with intrigue.* "That’s my line. I wanted to threaten her, not seduce her. Is Faris a masochist!?"

Faris: "Honestly, Faris didn’t want to talk so much about herself, nya. Most people, when they learn who I am, stop seeing me as Faris, nya. They only see the Akiha name. Faris and Akiha Rumiho want to be seen as separate purrsons, nya."

Okabe: *I shake my head, my mind racing to keep up with Faris's unpredictable antics.* "There’s nothing to separate. You are Faris NyanNyan, are you not?"

Faris: *I tilt my head, my eyes wide with confusion.* "Nya?"

Itaru: *I nod in agreement, my excitement returning.* "For once I agree with you, Okarin! Whenever she speaks NyanNyanian and wears her cat ears, she is Faris-tan!"

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, letting out an exasperated sigh.* "You’re just being overly self-conscious, Faris."

Faris: *I lower my gaze, my fingers fidgeting with the hem of my maid outfit.* "I don’t know, nya..."

Okabe: *I square my shoulders, looking Faris straight in the eye.* "I’m serious. To me, you will always be the unbeatable cat-eared maid!"

Faris: *I can't help but laugh, my heart feeling lighter.* "Nyahaha. Thanks, Kyouma."

Okabe: *I cross my arms over my chest, doing my best to maintain my composure.* "Faris, you said there would be a price to pay in exchange for your help acquiring an IBN 5100. What is your price? Do not test the limits of my good will. If I unseal my right arm for even an instant, everything will be destroyed, and nothing will remain... just so you know."

Faris: *I reach up, pointing at the cat ears on my head.* "Fine by me, nya. These cat ears have the power to negate all other powers -- NyanNyan Clear. When Kyouma’s power is unleashed, Faris will stop it, nya."
