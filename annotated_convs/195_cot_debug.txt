Plan:
In this scene, Faris, Okabe, Mayuri, and Itaru are present. 

Faris is a bubbly, energetic character who often uses cat-related phrases and actions. Her *actions* will be playful, quick, and usually involve some form of physical contact with others. She's also very friendly and affectionate, so her *actions* should reflect that. 

Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, often lost in his own world and dramatic in his actions and speech. His *actions* will be exaggerated, grandiose, and often involve him speaking into his phone for his imaginary audience. 

Mayuri is innocent and sweet, often confused by Okabe's antics but always supportive. Her *actions* will be gentle, caring, and often involve her showing concern or happiness for her friends.

Itaru is a bit more laid back, often playing the straight man to Okabe's antics. His *actions* will be more subdued, often involving him watching the others with amusement or mild annoyance.

The anchor lines will be Okabe's monologue into the phone and Faris' final question about the time machine. The first anchor line will emphasize Okabe's self-created drama and delusions of grandeur, while the second will highlight Faris' eagerness and curiosity, as well as Okabe's continued indulgence in his fantasies.

Roleplay:

Faris: *I clap my hands together, a grin spreading across my face.* "Purrfect. So now can I use the time machine, nya?"

Okabe: *I lift a finger, my gaze stern and serious.* "Indeed. But not a word to anyone. Death to traitors. That’s the law of the lab."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my brows furrowing in confusion.* "It is?"

Itaru: *I roll my eyes, shaking my head in amusement.* "No. Okarin made it up just now."

Faris: *I beam at Okabe, my eyes sparkling with gratitude.* "Thanks, Kyouma!"

Faris: *I suddenly lunge forward, wrapping my arms around Okabe's neck in an impromptu hug. The scent of my perfume fills the air, and I can feel him stiffen slightly at the unexpected contact.* 

Itaru: *I cross my arms, a scowl on my face.* "Okarin, you jerk! I helped make the PhoneWave too!"

Faris: *My eyes widen in surprise, and I quickly turn to Itaru, my arms outstretched.* "Really nya? Then Daru-nyan too!" *I dart over to him, leaving Okabe in my wake.*

Mayuri: *I watch Faris with a soft smile, my heart warming at her happiness.* "I’m glad she’s so happy, Okarin♪"

Okabe: *I chuckle, shaking my head at Mayuri's innocence.* "Heh heh heh... Mayuri, you really are innocent."

Mayuri: *I blink, tilting my head in confusion.* "Hweh?"

Okabe: *I pull out my phone, holding it up to my ear with a theatrical flourish.*

Okabe: *I let my voice drop to a low, conspiratorial tone.* "It’s me. ...Yeah, I’ve got her wrapped around my finger. What did you expect? She’s just a 17-year-old girl. That catgirl thinks she’s bargained with me to appease her lust for mankind’s dream, the forbidden fruit that is the time machine. But she’s dancing to the tune of Hououin Kyouma! ...Hmph, why did I agree to pay her price, you ask? That should be obvious."

Okabe: *I let a smirk spread across my face, my eyes glinting with a mix of amusement and excitement.* "That catgirl shall be our guinea pig. ...I’m a monster? What a terrible thing to say. Not that you’re wrong, exactly. Heh heh heh."

Mayuri: *I stare at Okabe, my eyes wide with confusion.* "...?"

Okabe: *I put away my phone, my mind buzzing with plans and possibilities. Faris will be our ticket to the future, I'm sure of it.*

Okabe: *My voice drops to a whisper, my words more for myself than anyone else.* "Right. Faris thinks she’s using us... But it is we who are using her! She is but a moth drawn to my brilliant flame. Muhahaha! As planned, we are proceeding to the next phase of the experiment. This is the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo."

Okabe: *I stiffen as someone taps me on the shoulder, and then I feel a breath on my ear, making me jump slightly.* "Mmgh!?"

Faris: *I peek over Okabe's shoulder, my voice filled with curiosity.* "Who were you talking to, nya?"

Okabe: *I turn to face Faris, my eyes meeting hers in a serious gaze.* "It’s too late, Faris NyanNyan. You’ve already taken the blood oath. If you break it, ruin will befall you. There is no escape."

Faris: *I nod, my eyes filled with determination.* "Ok, nya. So where’s the time machine, nya?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow at her eagerness, but I can't help but feel a sense of excitement myself.* "The time machine -- its name is the PhoneWave (name subject to change), by the way -- is in our lab."
