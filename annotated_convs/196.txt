Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, my brows furrowed in confusion.* "Umm, so does that mean it has to keep going for 86, 000 seconds? Won’t PhoneWave-chan get tired?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, my voice steady and confident.* "It doesn’t actually have to run the entire duration."

Okabe: *I mentally replay our previous experiments, my fingers drumming on the table.* "The mail reaches the past if you send it as soon as the discharge begins. In accordance with the Butterfly Effect, the remaining seconds should be canceled out. The experiment never happened."

Okabe: *I feel a sense of satisfaction as I recall the success of our previous tests. My fingers move swiftly over the phone's buttons, dialing Kurisu's number.*

Kurisu: *I pick up the phone, my voice filled with boredom.* "Hallo."

Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, a smirk on my face.* "It’s me. What’s the situation? She hung up on me!"

Itaru: *I chuckle, leaning back in my chair.* "Of course she did. Mayu-shi and I are the only ones who can deal with your act, you know?"

Okabe: *I frown, my fingers moving swiftly to redial Kurisu's number.* "Again!"

Kurisu: *I pick up the phone again, my tone slightly irritated.* "Hallo."

Okabe: *I clear my throat, trying to sound more serious.* "It’s Hououin Kyouma. Don’t hang up."

Kurisu: *I sigh, rolling my eyes.* "Oh, it’s Okabe. I was sure it was a prank call."

Okabe: *I feel a sense of indignation, my voice rising in volume.* "It shows you my number, doesn’t it!?"

Kurisu: *I chuckle, my voice filled with amusement.* "You were talking crazy, so I got scared and hung up."

Okabe: *I feel a rush of satisfaction, my voice filled with triumphant laughter.* "In other words, you fear the insanity of Hououin Kyouma! Well, I suppose you can’t be blamed for-- She hung up! Again!"

Itaru: *I shake my head, my voice filled with amusement, and a small amount of exasperation.* "Like I said, we’re the only ones who can put up with you..."

Okabe: *I feel a sense of frustration, but I quickly push it aside, focusing on the task at hand. I redial Kurisu's number.*

Kurisu: *I pick up the phone, my tone wary.* "Hallo."

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, trying to keep my voice steady.* "This is Okabe Rintaro. Sorry, but could you mess with the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s settings a little, please?"

Kurisu: *I feel a sense of relief, my voice softening slightly.* "Well why didn’t you say so? Hmm... you’re going to use the PhoneWave? I don’t want to anger the guy downstairs, though."

Okabe: *I feel a sense of urgency, my voice rising in intensity.* "We’re about to perform a critical experiment. Understand, assistant? Mister Braun might yell at you, but that small sacrifice will bring mankind’s dream, the time machine, to fruition."

Kurisu: *I sigh, shaking my head.* "You’re really irresponsible, you know that? ...Well? What should I set it to?"

Okabe: *I quickly relay the necessary information, my mind already moving on to the next step.* "Okay, it’s ready."

Okabe: *I feel a sense of anticipation, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Alright, thanks. Wait a bit."

Okabe: *I turn to Faris, my eyes meeting hers.* "Finished writing what you want to send?"

Okabe: *I see Faris nod, and I feel a sense of relief.* "What did you write? You sure it’s something that’ll change the past?"

Faris: *I feel a rush of embarrassment, my cheeks heating up.* "W-well..."

Okabe: *I notice Faris's hesitation, and I feel a pang of curiosity.* "Hm? What happened to her usual confidence?"

Faris: *I avoid Okabe's gaze, my voice barely above a whisper.* "I-it’s embarrassing, nya! A trade secret, nyan!"

Okabe: *I feel a sense of indignation, my voice filled with disbelief.* "A secret!? Nonsense! This is science! Unless we know what you’re sending, we can’t verify the results!"

Faris: *I feel a sense of frustration, my voice rising in volume.* "What’s that supposed to mean!? No one said anything about science, nya! I’m using the time machine for myself, not science, nya!"

Okabe: *I feel a sense of shock, my voice filled with disbelief.* "That’s not fair!"

Itaru: *I chuckle, shaking my head.* "You’re one to talk."
