Okabe: "That the IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine. I tried to cancel it by telling her it's a trap, but it didn't work. I'll try to phrase it differently." *I rub my temples, trying to think of a better way to convince her.*

Kurisu: "Wait. We went through this with the LOTO SIX experiment, remember?" *She interjects, her brows furrowed in thought.*

Okabe: *I pause, remembering the previous experiment.* "The person who reads the D-Mail chooses whether or not to act accordingly. Kiryu learned that the IBN 5100 was at the shrine. Though the cancellation mail came right afterward, I guess she ignored it and went anyway."

Kurisu: "Maybe she didn't believe the cancellation mail. Or maybe she was so diligent she decided to check it out even when told not to." *She suggests, crossing her arms as she thinks.*

Okabe: *I glance at Moeka, who's still hanging her head.* "We need a more persuasive message. Something that will prevent her from going to the shrine."

Kurisu: "Like what?" *She asks, looking at me expectantly.*

Okabe: "What if I send a D-Mail to myself on July 30th? Could I beat her to the IBN 5100?" *I suggest, but immediately doubt the feasibility of my own idea.*

Kurisu: "Were you even interested in the IBN 5100 then?" *She raises an eyebrow, challenging my idea.*

Okabe: *I rack my brain, trying to remember when I first became interested in the IBN 5100.* "...FB."

Kurisu: "What?" *She looks at me in confusion.*

Okabe: "Moeka's handler. She's obsessed with FB. If the mail comes from FB, she'll do whatever it says." *I explain, a glimmer of hope in my eyes.*

Kurisu: "Do you have FB's phone?" *She asks, her expression turning serious.*

Okabe: "No. They haven't even met. We don't know where FB is." *I admit, my hope quickly fading.*

Kurisu: "Then there's nothing we can do." *She says, shaking her head.*

Okabe: "Give me a little time." *I plead, unwilling to give up.*

Kurisu: "Gonna make me wait again? Well, I've been pulling all-nighters recently, so whatever. Just don't do anything stupid, okay?" *She sighs, leaning back in her chair.*
