Okabe: *I grit my teeth, my grip tightening around the phone as I listen to Kurisu's impatient voice on the other end.* "Don't rush me, dammit!"

Mayuri: *I shyly tug on Okabe's sleeve, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Um, Okarin, it’s probably something private, so I don’t think you should pry..."

Okabe: *I stare at Mayuri in disbelief, my mind racing.* Wh-what? Even Mayuri’s on Faris’s side? She was like this with Moeka too. *I let out a frustrated grunt.* "Mmmgh..."

Okabe: *I swallow hard, a sense of dread creeping up on me.* This is bad. I thought I had Faris in the palm of my hand. Was I dancing to her tune all along!?

Kurisu: *I tap my foot impatiently on the other end of the line.* "Okabe? If you’re not gonna send anything, I’m hanging up."

Okabe: *I clench my fist, my voice shaky.* "W-wait! Fine. Activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change)."

Okabe: *I let out a deep sigh, my shoulders slumping in defeat.* Dammit, I submitted to the catgirl!

Kurisu: *I nod, a hint of satisfaction in my voice.* "The discharge is starting."

Okabe: *I nod back to Faris, my heart pounding in my chest.* Faris puts her finger on the send button and--

Faris: *I press the send button with a flourish, a playful grin on my face.* "Click, nya!"

Okabe: *As the dizziness fades, I exhale slowly and open my eyes.* Alright, world. Show me your new form! Man, I wish I knew what kind of mail Faris sent. *I glance around the room, my gaze lingering on the window.*

Itaru: *I pick up a card from the table, a determined look on my face.* "Okay. Card Open."

Mayuri: *I gasp, my eyes wide with surprise.* "Oh no! Another Virus Card!"

Faris: *I giggle, my cat-like grin never fading.* "Not so fast, nyan♪"

Mayuri: *I pout, my shoulders drooping in defeat.* "Awww... You took three Link Cards, right? And I got three Virus Cards, right? Mayushii’s in trouble..."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, my curiosity piqued.* What are they doing? The three of them are sitting around a table, playing some kind of game.

Itaru: *I look at Mayuri, a glint of hope in my eyes.* "We still have a Terminal Card. We can turn the tables next turn."

Faris: *I giggle, my eyes sparkling with mischief.* "Nyahaha♪ It’s way too late for that, nya. Faris is going to use the Terminal Card, Virus Checker, nya. So, which is Mayushii’s last Virus Card, nya?"

Mayuri: *I gulp, my eyes darting around the room.* "Oh no..."

Itaru: *I sigh, shaking my head in disbelief.* "You’re a monster, Faris-tan."

Mayuri: *I look at Faris, my eyes pleading.* "H-hey, could you wait one... no, two or three turns, nya? Please, nya?"

Faris: *I lean back in my chair, a triumphant smile on my face.* "Nyaha♪ Not even if you try to copycat Faris, nyan."

Mayuri: *I slump in my chair, my eyes welling up with tears.* "No way!"
