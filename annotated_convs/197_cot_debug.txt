Plan:
The characters involved in this scene are Okabe, Mayuri, Kurisu, Faris, and Itaru. Their personalities and archetypes are as follows:
- Okabe: The eccentric "mad scientist" with a flair for the dramatic. He can be over-the-top and is often lost in his own world. 
- Mayuri: The innocent and cheerful one, often acting as the group's mood maker. She's kind-hearted and tends to act like a little sister to Okabe.
- Kurisu: The serious and straightforward genius scientist. She often acts as the voice of reason among the group.
- Faris: The playful and mysterious one. She often speaks in a cutesy manner, adding "nya" to her sentences.
- Itaru: The tech-savvy and laid-back member of the group. He often acts as a support to Okabe's antics.

The main theme of this scene is the tension between Okabe's desire to understand Faris's secret and the group's reluctance to pry. As such, the writing style will reflect this tension, with Okabe's thoughts and actions being dramatic and intense, while the others are more laid-back and casual.

The two anchor lines will be:
1. Okabe: "W-wait! Fine. Activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change)." - This is a turning point in the scene where Okabe gives in to Faris's demand.
2. Faris: "Nyaha♪ Not even if you try to copycat Faris, nyan." - This line showcases Faris's playful and mysterious character, adding a light-hearted touch to the otherwise tense scene.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, my grip tightening around the phone as I listen to Kurisu's impatient voice on the other end.* "Don't rush me, dammit!"

Mayuri: *I shyly tug on Okabe's sleeve, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Um, Okarin, it’s probably something private, so I don’t think you should pry..."

Okabe: *I stare at Mayuri in disbelief, my mind racing.* Wh-what? Even Mayuri’s on Faris’s side? She was like this with Moeka too. *I let out a frustrated grunt.* "Mmmgh..."

Okabe: *I swallow hard, a sense of dread creeping up on me.* This is bad. I thought I had Faris in the palm of my hand. Was I dancing to her tune all along!?

Kurisu: *I tap my foot impatiently on the other end of the line.* "Okabe? If you’re not gonna send anything, I’m hanging up."

Okabe: *I clench my fist, my voice shaky.* "W-wait! Fine. Activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change)."

Okabe: *I let out a deep sigh, my shoulders slumping in defeat.* Dammit, I submitted to the catgirl!

Kurisu: *I nod, a hint of satisfaction in my voice.* "The discharge is starting."

Okabe: *I nod back to Faris, my heart pounding in my chest.* Faris puts her finger on the send button and--

Faris: *I press the send button with a flourish, a playful grin on my face.* "Click, nya!"

Okabe: *As the dizziness fades, I exhale slowly and open my eyes.* Alright, world. Show me your new form! Man, I wish I knew what kind of mail Faris sent. *I glance around the room, my gaze lingering on the window.*

Itaru: *I pick up a card from the table, a determined look on my face.* "Okay. Card Open."

Mayuri: *I gasp, my eyes wide with surprise.* "Oh no! Another Virus Card!"

Faris: *I giggle, my cat-like grin never fading.* "Not so fast, nyan♪"

Mayuri: *I pout, my shoulders drooping in defeat.* "Awww... You took three Link Cards, right? And I got three Virus Cards, right? Mayushii’s in trouble..."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, my curiosity piqued.* What are they doing? The three of them are sitting around a table, playing some kind of game.

Itaru: *I look at Mayuri, a glint of hope in my eyes.* "We still have a Terminal Card. We can turn the tables next turn."

Faris: *I giggle, my eyes sparkling with mischief.* "Nyahaha♪ It’s way too late for that, nya. Faris is going to use the Terminal Card, Virus Checker, nya. So, which is Mayushii’s last Virus Card, nya?"

Mayuri: *I gulp, my eyes darting around the room.* "Oh no..."

Itaru: *I sigh, shaking my head in disbelief.* "You’re a monster, Faris-tan."

Mayuri: *I look at Faris, my eyes pleading.* "H-hey, could you wait one... no, two or three turns, nya? Please, nya?"

Faris: *I lean back in my chair, a triumphant smile on my face.* "Nyaha♪ Not even if you try to copycat Faris, nyan."

Mayuri: *I slump in my chair, my eyes welling up with tears.* "No way!"
