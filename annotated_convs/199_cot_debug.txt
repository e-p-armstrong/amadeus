Planning:

Characters involved:
1. Itaru (Daru): He's an otaku and a hacker. His actions and thoughts would revolve around his interests and his laid-back nature. He can be surprised but usually isn't too expressive.
2. Mayuri: She's cheerful, innocent and slightly air-headed. Her actions would reflect her bubbly personality and her love for costumes and 'cute' things. She's often clueless about serious matters.
3. Okabe: He's eccentric, dramatic and often paranoid. His actions would reflect his intense emotions and his struggle to cope with the changes in reality.

Thematic direction:
1. Itaru: "Porn?" - This will be turned into a casual, humorous anchor line reflecting Itaru's personality and his surprise.
2. Okabe: "Chaos has forsaken this place..." - This will be a dramatic anchor line, highlighting Okabe's disbelief and despair.

Roleplay:

Itaru: *I glance up from my computer screen, a bit of surprise flickering in my eyes.* "Porn?"

Mayuri: *I shake my head, a warm smile dancing on my lips, my fingers absentmindedly tracing the edges of the doujinshi in my hands.* "No, but the illustrator is Kouga Yui-san. Mayushii thinks it’s finally time to get serious about costumes again."

Itaru: *My eyebrows shoot up, a flicker of recognition lighting up my face.* "Kouga Yui? She was the character designer for last year’s Gunbam."

Mayuri: *I nod enthusiastically, my eyes sparkling with excitement.* "Yup!"

Itaru: *I scratch my head, considering for a moment before deciding.* "Buy me one too."

Mayuri: *My eyes twinkle with delight, and I give him a quick nod.* "Okey dokey♪"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, confusion marring my face as I look between the two.* "What are you guys talking about? If you want doujinshi, why not go to Toranoana? It’s right over there."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my brows furrowing in confusion.* "There, where?"

Okabe: *I point out towards the store, a confident smile on my face.* "You know, there! Right over--" *The smile fades, and my heart skips a beat. I follow my pointing finger, but Toranoana isn’t there.*

Okabe: *Blinking rapidly, a sense of confusion washes over me.* "Wha...?"

Okabe: *I rub my eyes and blink several times, hoping it would make a difference. But no, it’s nowhere to be found. And what’s more, I can’t find Animate either. It’s supposed to be right next to Toranoana. Instead, I see electronics stores. Daiichi Kaden and T-2ONE Minami. I've never seen them before in my life. Wait... I remember Mister Braun saying that Akiba used to have a lot more electronics shops. Many of them closed. I think Daiichi Kaden and T-2ONE Minami were among them.* 

Okabe: *A wave of panic washes over me, and I feel my heart pounding in my chest.* "Where the hell did Toranoana and Animate go!?"

Itaru: *I stare at him, my eyebrows furrowed in concern.* "Have you lost it, man?"

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by his response.* "Huh?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a look of innocent confusion on my face.* "There aren’t any Toranoanas or Animates in Akiba. That’s why Mayushii’s going to Nakano to buy doujinshi."

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest, a sense of disbelief washing over me.* "What do you mean there aren’t any!? They were there yesterday, weren’t they!?"

Okabe: *My mind races, trying to recall the events of the day. I wasn't really paying attention on the way to Faris’s apartment, but I'm pretty sure they were still there.*

Itaru: *I shake my head, a bemused expression on my face.* "There’s no moe stores in Akiba, man. You know that. The holy land of moe is Nakano."

Okabe: *I feel a jolt of shock, my heart pounding in my chest.* "But Akiba is the holy land of moe! The whole world knows that!"

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, a mix of concern and confusion on my face.* "Has the heat finally gone to your head, Okarin? Akiba is the electric town. If you opened a moe store here, the electronics otaku would riot."

Okabe: *I feel a cold shiver run down my spine. My memories don’t match reality. The past has changed. Part of me knows what has happened. But I still can’t help but ask.* "What about Mandarake?"

Mayuri: *I shake my head, a look of confusion on my face.* "Nope."

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my palms beginning to sweat.* "Akiba-o!?"

Itaru: *I nod, trying to reassure him.* "Of course there’s an Akiba-o."

Okabe: *I shake my head, my voice rising in panic.* "I mean Akiba-okoku, where they sell doujinshi!"

Itaru: *I frown, shaking my head in confusion.* "The hell’s that?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a look of innocent curiosity on my face.* "They sell doujinshi at Akiba-o?"

Itaru: *I shake my head, a bemused smile on my face.* "Of course not. That would be crazy."

Okabe: *I feel my heart pounding in my chest, my mind racing as I try to grasp the situation.* "Gamers!? Ramutara!?"

Okabe: *I look at their blank faces, and a cold shiver runs down my spine. I swallow hard, the reality of the situation finally sinking in.*

Okabe: *I clench my fists, my heart aching with a sense of loss.* "Chaos has forsaken this place..."
