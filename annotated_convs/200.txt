Okabe: *I wander through the streets of Akiba, my heart heavy with a sense of loss.* "Mayuri. You work at MayQueen, don’t you?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head in confusion, a wrinkle forming between my brows.* "MayQueen? What’s that? A potato?"

Okabe: *I repeat the name, emphasizing each syllable, my voice echoing with desperation.* "MayQueen+Nyan²!"

Mayuri: *I shake my head, my eyes wide with innocence.* "Mayushii works at Lemoine, remember?"

Okabe: *A chill runs down my spine at the mention of the unfamiliar name.* "Lemoine? Is that a maid cafe?"

Mayuri: *I giggle, shrugging off the tension in the air.* "It’s just a normal coffee shop."

Okabe: *I scratch my chin, my thoughts spiraling.* "Is there even a single maid cafe in Akiba?"

Itaru: *I lean back, shaking my head with a smirk.* "Naw man. The people here hate moe businesses. Nobody would go."

Okabe: *I feel a rush of understanding sweep over me, my heart pounding in my chest.* It’s clear now. This has to be the result of Faris’s D-Mail. The Butterfly Effect is at it again. Faris said she had influence over Akiba’s development board. They adopted her plan and embraced the moe industry. But by sending a D-Mail to 2000, the worldline has shifted to one where that never happened. Akiba is still electronics all the way. To think that a single mail could rewrite ten years of a town’s history. Is it okay to change history on a whim like this? I almost feel guilty about it, but since I’m the only one who remembers the original Akiba, nobody can blame me. And it’s not like I can change it back. But still... what in the world did Faris’s D-Mail say? *I spend the next morning wandering through the streets of Akiba, my mind whirling with thoughts and observations.* Despite the changes, Akiba still remains Akiba at its core, the essence of the town still intact. *I take in the sight of the familiar electronics stores, the sounds of the bustling streets, the sight of the otaku culture thriving.* Yet, the absence of the maids and young female otaku is noticeable, their absence leaving a void in the lively town. *I find comfort in the unchanged past, the memories of how we met Faris on this worldline bringing a sense of relief.* Our past has changed considerably, yet we still ended up with the same close relationship we had on the last worldline. Perhaps Lady Luck is indeed looking out for us. *A beep from my phone interrupts my thoughts, a new mail lighting up the screen.* 

Okabe: *I stare at the screen, my blood running cold.* "What the hell?"
