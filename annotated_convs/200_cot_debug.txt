Okabe: *Clutching FB's phone tightly, I scan the area for any sign of the police.* "Do you think Daru's still in the lab?" *I ask, my mind already formulating the message I need to send.*

Kurisu: "I'll try calling." *She pulls out her phone, her fingers moving swiftly over the screen.*

Okabe: *As I wait, I can't help but feel a pang of guilt at what I'm about to do.* "I'll send the same message I tried to send earlier from Moeka's phone." *I mutter to myself.* "Only this time, it will be from FB's phone. When Moeka sees it, she'll believe it to be an order from FB. Knowing her dependence on FB, she'll obey without question." *I clench my fist around the phone, my insides churning.*

Kurisu: "He said he'll be there in five minutes." *She hangs up the call, a look of relief washing over her face.*

Okabe: *I let out a sigh, trying to push my guilt to the back of my mind.* "So we just wait until then." 

Kurisu: "By the way, something weird happened back there." *After closing her phone, she glances at Moeka, then leans in, lowering her voice.*

Okabe: "Her... who?" *I ask, even though I already know the answer. There's only one person it could be.*

Kurisu: "Nae-chan. She ran out the back door. When I called her to stop... our eyes met." *She murmurs, her brows furrowed in confusion.*
