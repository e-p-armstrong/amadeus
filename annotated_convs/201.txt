Okabe: *Thoughts spinning inside my head, I see enemies in every pedestrian. Panic seizes me and I flee from the crowd. After managing to regain my composure, I head back to the lab, opting to write off the threatening email as a mere prank.* "It’s Sunday. Obon weekend. What are you doing here, lab girls?" *I greet my friends, trying to keep the anxiety from seeping into my voice.*

Luka: *Bowing slightly in my usual polite manner, I respond,* "Pardon the intrusion, Okabe-san."

Mayuri: *Waving energetically, I greet Okabe with a bright smile.* "Good morning, Okarin♪"

Okabe: *Looking around, I see Mayuri and Luka sitting together on the sofa, engrossed in a book.* "What are you doing?"

Mayuri: "Yesterday I went to Nakano to buy doujinshi, remember? While I was there, I found a photo album of a super cute cosplayer! So I splurged on it♪ Look, Luka-chan! This is a costume of Sedona from Blood Tune. It’s so detailed and cute!"

Luka: *I gaze at the photo album, my eyes lighting up.* "It is!"

Okabe: *I can't help but smile at the sight. It's heartwarming to see Luka showing interest in cosplay, something he had always been too shy to explore.*

Mayuri: "Take a look, Chris-chan! It’s amazing!"

Kurisu: *Without looking up from my English book, I respond dismissively.* "I’m okay."

Okabe: *I feel a twinge of annoyance at Kurisu's cold response, but seeing Mayuri unfazed, I decide not to intervene.*

Mayuri: "Wow, look at these swimsuits! So much skin! She’s got a great figure, like a gravure idol."

Luka: "Must be nice..."

Mayuri: "Nice? The swimsuits?"

Luka: *I blush, fidgeting with the hem of my skirt.* "I... don’t have that great a figure..."

Mayuri: "Don’t worry, Luka-chan. I’m sure you’ll make our big friends breathe hard."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow at Mayuri's remark, wondering who she could possibly be referring to.*

Mayuri: "And um, plenty of people like flat chests. So even if you don’t have breasts, you should still have confidence in yourself."

Kurisu: *I choke on my tea, coughing to cover my surprise.* "Khmmkhmmkhmm!"
