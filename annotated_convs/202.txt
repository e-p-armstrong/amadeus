Luka: *I fidget with the hem of my skirt, avoiding direct eye contact.* "Um... all of the lab mems?"

Kurisu: *I glance at the clock on the wall, my brows knitting together in concern.* "I can’t go. I have to go back to America soon, and I haven’t even started packing yet."

Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Yes, I can see you’re in a rush. I bet you don’t even have time to lounge around and read."

Kurisu: *In a swift motion, I snap my book shut, throwing Okabe a pointed glare.* "Fine, I’ll be blunt. There’s no way I’m swimming with two perverts like you! If it’s just the girl members, I’ll happily go."

Okabe: *I chuckle, resting my hand on my chin.* "Hmph. Be honest, Christina. You just don’t want me to see the Mongolian Spot on your butt!"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, my lips forming a tight line.* "I don’t have a Mongolian Spot!"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, my gaze shifting between Kurisu and Luka.* "Anyway, if it’s just the girl members, then doesn’t that rule out Lukako?"

Kurisu: *I tilt my head, a frown tugging at my lips.* "What’s that supposed to mean?"

Okabe: *With a dramatic sweep of my arm, I point at Luka.* "Didn’t we tell you earlier? Lukako is a bonafide guy!"

Okabe: *I feel a chill creep into the room, their reactions throwing me off.* "You’re the worst. Where do you get off calling her a guy?"

Mayuri: *I furrow my brow, my hands clasped tightly in my lap.* "Yeah, Okarin. That’s a terrible thing to say."

Okabe: *I glance at Luka, noticing how his face has turned pale and his eyes are hidden beneath his hair. Is he... crying?* "Christina. I understand your desire to deny the truth. It’s difficult to imagine that a guy could ever be so cute, but--"

Kurisu: *I step forward, my gaze stern.* "Okabe!"

Kurisu: *I take a deep breath, my fists clenched at my sides.* "If you want to give me stupid nicknames, that’s fine -- I mean, it’s not, but... What you said just now is below the belt. I didn’t take you for the kind of guy who thinks it’s funny to hurt people’s feelings, but I guess I was wrong. You’re a real jerk, Okabe."

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by her sudden harsh words.* "Huh?"

Kurisu: *I point at Luka, my voice firm.* "Apologize. Apologize to Urushibara-san right now."

Okabe: *I hold my hands up defensively.* "Wait a second. I don’t have to apologize for anything. I just said the tru--"

Luka: *I rise from the sofa, my voice barely a whisper.* "It’s okay."

Luka: *I keep my head down, my hands trembling.* "So that’s how Okabe-san sees me..."

Okabe: *I wave my hands frantically, trying to correct the misunderstanding.* "No no no! That’s not how I see you, Lukako. You’re a guy, remember!? Or are you denying reality too!?"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, my gaze hard.* "You’re the one denying reality!"

Mayuri: *I nod in agreement, my voice soft.* "That’s right! Luka-chan’s a girl, Okarin. You’re terrible."

Okabe: *I turn to Mayuri, my brows furrowing in confusion.* "Mayuri, when did you start calling Lukako ’Luka-chan’ instead of ’Luka-kun’?"

Kurisu: *I glare at Okabe, my patience wearing thin.* "Cut it out already, Okabe! She’s a girl!"
