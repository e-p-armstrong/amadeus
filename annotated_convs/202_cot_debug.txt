Okabe: *I reach over, gently squeezing Moeka's hand.* 

Moeka: "I had... nothing... except FB... The only... place... I belonged... I would... kill... to protect it... You're right... to hate me... I'm... so...rry..."

Okabe: *I look down at her, my voice soft.* "I forgive you." *I repeat the words, as if to convince myself as much as her.* "I forgive you." *A third time, for finality.* "I forgive you."

Moeka: *A single tear falls down her cheek as her eyes slowly close, her hand slipping from mine.*

Okabe: *Biting my lip, I lay her down gently, placing her purple phone in her hands.*

Kurisu: "...Okabe." *She calls softly, her eyes full of sympathy.*

Okabe: *I nod, acknowledging her.* "Yeah..."

Kurisu: "I think you should send the D-Mail. Everything's ready at the lab." *She speaks in a steady voice, a stark contrast to the heavy air in the room.*

Okabe: *I pause, contemplating her words.* "Hey, Christina. When I send the D-Mail and change divergence, do you think Moeka's fate will change?"

Kurisu: "Based on the attractor field model you spoke of..." *She looks thoughtful, a frown creasing her brow.* "She'll be more likely to live if divergence exceeds 1%. ...Sorry. I wish I knew what to say."
