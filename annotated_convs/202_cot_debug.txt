Planning:
The characters involved in this scene are Luka, Kurisu, Okabe, and Mayuri. 
- Okabe is eccentric, flamboyant, and fond of dramatic flair, often indulging in over-the-top gestures and a booming voice. However, in this scene, he is confused and defensive, so his actions will be more restrained, and his thoughts more focused on trying to understand what's happening.
- Kurisu is serious, intelligent, and often comes off as cold, but she is also deeply empathetic. Her actions will be more subtle, often involving her gaze or the way she holds herself.
- Mayuri is cheerful, innocent, and somewhat naive. Her actions will reflect her bubbly personality, often involving her hands or her expressive face.
- Luka is shy, delicate, and sensitive. His actions will be timid, often involving his gaze or small gestures.

The anchor lines will be Kurisu's rebuke of Okabe and Luka's response to Okabe's comments. These lines will be expanded to reflect the emotions of the characters and the impact of their words.

Roleplay:
Luka: *I fidget with the hem of my skirt, avoiding direct eye contact.* "Um... all of the lab mems?"

Kurisu: *I glance at the clock on the wall, my brows knitting together in concern.* "I can’t go. I have to go back to America soon, and I haven’t even started packing yet."

Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Yes, I can see you’re in a rush. I bet you don’t even have time to lounge around and read."

Kurisu: *In a swift motion, I snap my book shut, throwing Okabe a pointed glare.* "Fine, I’ll be blunt. There’s no way I’m swimming with two perverts like you! If it’s just the girl members, I’ll happily go."

Okabe: *I chuckle, resting my hand on my chin.* "Hmph. Be honest, Christina. You just don’t want me to see the Mongolian Spot on your butt!"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, my lips forming a tight line.* "I don’t have a Mongolian Spot!"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, my gaze shifting between Kurisu and Luka.* "Anyway, if it’s just the girl members, then doesn’t that rule out Lukako?"

Kurisu: *I tilt my head, a frown tugging at my lips.* "What’s that supposed to mean?"

Okabe: *With a dramatic sweep of my arm, I point at Luka.* "Didn’t we tell you earlier? Lukako is a bonafide guy!"

Okabe: *I feel a chill creep into the room, their reactions throwing me off.* "You’re the worst. Where do you get off calling her a guy?"

Mayuri: *I furrow my brow, my hands clasped tightly in my lap.* "Yeah, Okarin. That’s a terrible thing to say."

Okabe: *I glance at Luka, noticing how his face has turned pale and his eyes are hidden beneath his hair. Is he... crying?* "Christina. I understand your desire to deny the truth. It’s difficult to imagine that a guy could ever be so cute, but--"

Kurisu: *I step forward, my gaze stern.* "Okabe!"

Kurisu: *I take a deep breath, my fists clenched at my sides.* "If you want to give me stupid nicknames, that’s fine -- I mean, it’s not, but... What you said just now is below the belt. I didn’t take you for the kind of guy who thinks it’s funny to hurt people’s feelings, but I guess I was wrong. You’re a real jerk, Okabe."

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by her sudden harsh words.* "Huh?"

Kurisu: *I point at Luka, my voice firm.* "Apologize. Apologize to Urushibara-san right now."

Okabe: *I hold my hands up defensively.* "Wait a second. I don’t have to apologize for anything. I just said the tru--"

Luka: *I rise from the sofa, my voice barely a whisper.* "It’s okay."

Luka: *I keep my head down, my hands trembling.* "So that’s how Okabe-san sees me..."

Okabe: *I wave my hands frantically, trying to correct the misunderstanding.* "No no no! That’s not how I see you, Lukako. You’re a guy, remember!? Or are you denying reality too!?"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, my gaze hard.* "You’re the one denying reality!"

Mayuri: *I nod in agreement, my voice soft.* "That’s right! Luka-chan’s a girl, Okarin. You’re terrible."

Okabe: *I turn to Mayuri, my brows furrowing in confusion.* "Mayuri, when did you start calling Lukako ’Luka-chan’ instead of ’Luka-kun’?"

Kurisu: *I glare at Okabe, my patience wearing thin.* "Cut it out already, Okabe! She’s a girl!"
