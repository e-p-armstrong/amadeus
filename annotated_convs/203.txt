Luka: "I’m going home!" *I announce, my voice barely more than a whisper, as I try to slip past Okabe and out of the lab.*

Okabe: *I quickly grab Luka's hand, preventing his escape.* "Hold it, Lukako! You can’t fool me! You’re as much a man as I am! And I know how to prove it!" *In a swift motion, I pin Lukako’s arms and reach for his lower body. My hand meets nothing but empty space.*

Okabe: "Oh...?" *A confusing mix of shock and disbelief washes over me.*

Luka: "Ah..." *I release a small whimper, my cheeks flushing a deep red.*

Kurisu: "You..." *I grit my teeth, feeling a surge of anger at Okabe's audacity.*

Mayuri: "Awawa..." *My eyes widen in surprise, not fully understanding the situation but sensing the tension in the room.*

Okabe: "Ohhhh? Huh? What? Why?" *I feel around some more, my mind struggling to comprehend the reality.*

Luka: "Ugh, no, don’t... Okabe-san, please... stop... sniff." *I whimper, my voice breaking as tears well up in my eyes.*

Okabe: *The pieces finally fall into place. The D-Mail that I thought had failed... Was actually a success!* "Lukako, you..." *I gasp, my eyes wide with realization.* "You’re a girl!?"

Kurisu: "That’s what we’ve been saying!" *I snap, my patience worn thin.*

Okabe: *Suddenly, a sharp pain erupts from the top of my head. I stumble, blinking to clear my vision.* 

Luka: "Hic... ugg... egh..." *I sob quietly, feeling overwhelmed by the situation.*

Mayuri: *I rush to Luka's side, rubbing her back in an attempt to soothe her.*

Okabe: *Slowly, my vision clears and I take in the scene before me. Luka is crying, Mayuri is comforting her, and Kurisu is glaring down at me, her eyes filled with disgust. The top of my head throbs painfully, undoubtedly thanks to Kurisu's textbook.*

Kurisu: "I want to vivisect your skull and remove your brain for a good washing. Then I’ll submerge it in culture fluid so you can never do anything like that again! Anyway, just be thankful I haven’t reported you to the police." *I spit out the words, my eyes never leaving Okabe.*

Okabe: "Yes ma’am. I’m sorry." *I mutter, pressing a moist towel to my throbbing head.*
