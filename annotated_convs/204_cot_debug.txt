Planning stage:

The characters involved in this scene are Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru. 

- Okabe is a bit of a mad scientist type. He's dramatic, flamboyant, and sees himself as a lone genius. His *actions* and *thoughts* should be filled with self-aggrandizement and theatricality. 
- Kurisu is more pragmatic, straightforward, and tends to call out Okabe on his eccentricities. She's a little sarcastic and doesn't hesitate to put Okabe in his place. Her *actions* should reflect her practicality and no-nonsense attitude.
- Mayuri is sweet, innocent, and a little naive. Her *actions* should be gentle and kind, filled with curiosity and simplicity.
- Itaru, or Daru, is a bit of a geek. He's more grounded than Okabe but has his own quirks. His *actions* should reflect his laid-back nature and geeky interests.

I'll make Okabe's first line and Kurisu's retort at his 'Reading Steiner' concept the anchors of this scene. Okabe's line will be all about his grandiose self-perception and the thrill he feels at his perceived power, while Kurisu's line will sharply bring him back down to reality.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I chuckle to myself, basking in the glow of my own brilliance.* "Heh heh heh... as I already explained, we changed the past. Lukako was a guy, but he wanted to be a girl, so we sent a D-Mail to make his wish come true. And it worked! I knew the worldline had changed. My magic eye, Reading Steiner, saw the shift in time. But I chose to believe my mundane senses instead. I should have had more faith in my powers! I won’t make that mistake again."

Kurisu: *I feel a prickling annoyance at Okabe's grandstanding. I ready my book above my head, preparing to bring him back down to earth.* "Want some more?"

Okabe: *I ignore the looming threat of Kurisu's book, my eyes sparkling with fervor.* "I’m telling the truth. You have to believe me! I can explain this phenomenon logically. When we sent the D-Mail, we changed the past, and all of history changed as a result. My brain perceived that change!"

Okabe: *Overcome with excitement, I leap to my feet, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Out of all mankind, I alone can perceive changes in causality! I am this world’s observer!" *I look around, expecting to see awe on their faces.*

Kurisu: *I give Okabe a level look, my patience wearing thin.* "Sit down before I hit you again."

Okabe: *Cowed, I do as I’m told, but my enthusiasm remains undimmed.* "Don’t you understand? I’m the observer, the one who opens the box holding Schrodinger’s cat."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, my brows furrowed in confusion.* "Shredding Gar?"

Itaru: *I chuckle to myself, shaking my head at Okabe's theatrics.* "Schrodinger’s cat again? The Japanese can’t get enough of that cat."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow at Itaru, a hint of amusement in my voice.* "You’re Japanese too."

Itaru: *I shrug nonchalantly, my fingers tapping out a rhythm on the tabletop.* "I’ve had enough Schrodinger, thanks. I do admit that kittehs are cute, though."

Okabe: *I frown, my earlier enthusiasm deflating a little.* "Gh..." *Daru’s absolutely right. Whenever an anime wants to use quantum mechanics, the characters always talk about Schrodinger’s Cat.*

Okabe: "Anyway, my magic eye has the power to perceive changes in the worldline. This power is called Reading Steiner, as I’ve explained."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, exasperation creeping into my voice.* "And I told you that that name was stupid, remember? It’s Engrish, like something from a kid’s manga. Not to mention it’s a grammatical mess, and there’s also the fact that it’s half German, so no consistency there either. It’s stupid. The same goes for that ’Steins Gate’ thing you’re always talking about."

Okabe: *I chuckle again, undeterred by Kurisu's criticism.* "Heh heh heh... looks like you’ve still got that Mongolian Spot on your butt. Eh, Christina? Names are all about feeling! My creativity, comparable to the great Da Vinci himself, cannot be held by the shackles of grammar! Muhah--" *I'm cut off as Kurisu's book collides with my head, leaving me seeing stars.*

Kurisu: *I lower my book, a satisfied smirk on my face.* "Show a little remorse, huh?"

Okabe: *I rub my head, wincing at the pain.* "I’m sorry..."
