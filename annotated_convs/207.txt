Kurisu: "Let me sleep, for crying out loud." *She rubs her eyes tiredly, her voice barely more than a whisper.*

Okabe: "A question, Daru." *I turn to address Itaru, ignoring Kurisu's plea.* "Have you researched how to use the IBN 5100?"

Itaru: "Huh? Well, yeah, I guess." *He shrugs nonchalantly.* "Can you believe I did it while preparing for ComiMa? I'm like a saint or something. They'd knight me for this in England."

Okabe: "Then we shall call you Sir Super Hacka!" *I declare, my arms thrown wide in theatrics.*

Itaru: "Hell no." *He responds flatly, not even looking up from his computer.*

Kurisu: "Will you guys shut up? You're giving me a headache." *She groans, massaging her temples.*

Okabe: "Hear me, lab mems!" *I announce loudly, standing tall despite the empty room.* "Our long struggle has at last reached its climax! Ragnarok is at hand! Now we must deliver the decisive blow. With the power of the IBN 5100, we shall crack SERN's most secure database and destroy it from the inside!"

Kurisu: "Argh! Shut up!" *She snaps, rising from the sofa abruptly.*

Itaru: "Nobody can know the darkness in Okarin's heart..." *He mutters, glancing at me with a knowing grin.*

Kurisu: "First, get your character straight! What kind of mad scientist talks about the Hammer of Justice?" *She retorts, folding her arms across her chest.*

Okabe: "Come on, guys! Stop complaining and get ready!" *I urge, my patience wearing thin.*

Itaru: "Get ready?" *He asks, his brow furrowing in confusion.*

Okabe: "To crack SERN! Weren't you listening?" *I respond, my voice filled with exasperation.*

Kurisu: "Uh, I don't think that's a good idea." *She voices her concerns, her gaze stern and serious.*

Okabe: "When did you become a goody two shoes? Where's your ambition!?" *I retort, my voice rising in intensity.*

Kurisu: "Are you trying to get us arrested?" *She shoots back, her voice sharp.*

Okabe: "That's not the problem!" *I argue, my voice full of frustration.* "It's taken me so long -- so long -- just to reach this point! This is my chance to escape the Alpha worldline and save Mayuri. I won't let anyone get in my way. Anyone!"

Itaru: "W-why so serious, man?" *He stutters, looking at me with wide eyes.*

Okabe: "Please!" *I beg, bowing my head deeply.* "Please, hear me out."

Itaru: "I-it's not like I'm cracking for you or anything, okay!?" *He stammers, avoiding my gaze.*

Kurisu: "Oh god..." *She sighs, rolling her eyes in exasperation.*
