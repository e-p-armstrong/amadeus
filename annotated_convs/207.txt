Suzuha: *I lean against my bike, a playful smirk on my face.* "Anyway, you can send mail to the past? That’s amazing! The first time machine ever!"

Okabe: *I puff out my chest, a proud grin spreading across my face.* "Hmph, of course it’s amazing. I am Hououin Kyouma!"

Suzuha: *I tilt my head, my brows furrowing in curiosity.* "Any plans to upgrade it?"

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, caught off guard by the question.* "Upgrade it?"

Suzuha: *I chuckle, a twinkle of mischief in my eyes.* "You know, like sending people to the past or something."

Okabe: *I stroke my chin, a thoughtful expression on my face.* "We’re working on it." *Though inwardly, I grumble about our lack of progress.*

Suzuha: *I straighten up, my gaze serious as I look at Okabe.* "Then let me give you one word of advice. You should leave Makise Kurisu out of it."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, puzzled by her warning.* "What do you have against her, anyway?"

Suzuha: *I shrug nonchalantly, hopping onto my bike.* "Welp. Better get back to the workshop. I only got a 30-minute break. I’ll get in trouble if I don’t get back soon."

Okabe: *I step forward, my hand outstretched to stop her.* "Come to the lab tomorrow, whether you meet your father or not."

Suzuha: *I pause, glancing back at him.* "Why?"

Okabe: *I let out a sinister chuckle, a wicked glint in my eyes.* "So I can use your grief to power my time machine. Heh heh heh!"

Suzuha: *I laugh heartily, shaking my head in amusement.* "Ahaha! You really are a mad scientist. So eeeevil! If I meet my father, I’ll stop by. Then we can do a gun salute!"

Okabe: *I watch as she pedals away, a determined look on her face.* "Hey, wait! Let me on! Hey!" *I'm left alone, my only choice is to make my way back to the lab.*

Okabe: *I gather the lab members around, a serious expression on my face.* "I shall now brief you on Operation Eldhrimnir."

Okabe: *I pace around the room, my gaze piercing each member.* "I want you guys to get ready for a party." *I had already explained Suzuha's situation to them earlier.*

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, my brows furrowing in doubt.* "And what are you going to do?"

Okabe: *I flash a confident grin, my chest swelling with bravado.* "Me? I’m going to follow that Part-Time Warrior and report back as the situation changes."

Kurisu: *I narrow my eyes, my voice cold and stern.* "Don’t you dare. Let her be alone with her father."

Okabe: *I throw my head back and laugh, my voice echoing in the room.* "Heh heh heh. You shouldn’t be so quick to reject my plans, Christina. You don’t understand the intricacies of the human psyche. Now that you’ve rejected my plan, there’s no way I’m not going through with it! You have underestimated my pride!"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, a dismissive sneer on my face.* "Get over yourself."

Okabe: *I lean in, my gaze intense as I challenge her.* "Besides, Christina, you and she are enemies, are you not? You protect her from me while plotting her demise? That makes you a hypocrite!"

Kurisu: *I shrug, my tone casual as I brush off his accusations.* "You just don’t have standards, that’s all."

Mayuri: *I nod in agreement, my hands busy with my sewing.* "She’s right. I don’t think you should bother her, Okarin."

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes wide and bright with anticipation.* "No matter what happens, we need to give her a waaaarm welcome. I’ll do anything to help make this party super special."

Luka: *I fidget with the hem of my dress, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Um, actually, I haven’t met this Suzuha-san..."
