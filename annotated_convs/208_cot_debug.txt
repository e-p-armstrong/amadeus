Okabe: "I tried to save Mayuri, but nothing worked. Every worldline converged on the same result, just as attractor field theory said they would." *I pace back and forth, my gaze focused on nothing in particular as I dive deep into my thoughts.*

Itaru: "You know, if this is all in your head, I think you've got a career as a light novel author ahead of you." *He chuckles, trying to lighten the mood.*

Okabe: "It's true. All of it. To prevent Mayuri's death..." *I stop in my tracks, looking at my friends with renewed determination.* "...and to free Suzuha's future from SERN, we need to escape from the Alpha worldline. And I think we can do that by canceling all of our changes to the timeline so far. That should return us to the Beta worldline, the worldline that existed before I sent that first D-Mail. There's just one more step. We need to erase the first D-Mail from SERN's database."

Kurisu: "Fascinating." *She murmurs, sipping her coffee, her eyes focused on me though I can tell she's lost in thought.*

Itaru: "You believe him, Makise-shi?" *He asks, leaning back in his chair and looking towards Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "In theory. I'd like to see objective data, but that's obviously impossible." *She admits, setting her coffee down and crossing her arms.*

Okabe: "Relax. Your Time Leap Machine worked perfectly." *I reassure her, offering her a small smile.*

Kurisu: "O-of course it did." *She stammers, looking away, a soft blush covering her cheeks.*

Kurisu: "Besides, we were already planning to crack SERN's database, weren't we? Fine. Let's see what's in there. If the mail data exists, then it's proof that what you said is true." *She declares, her eyes shining with determination.*

Itaru: "So what you're saying is, 'don't think, feel.' Got it." *He says, standing up from his chair and stretching.*

Okabe: "What he meant to say was, 'don't think, do.'" *I correct him, a small amused smile playing on my lips.*

Itaru: "Done bridging them. I need to tinker with the settings a little, but we should be up and running in about ten minutes." *He announces, settling back into his chair with a satisfied sigh.*

Okabe: "Alright." *I acknowledge, crossing my arms and looking towards Kurisu.* "So the first D-Mail started everything... Was that the one you showed me at ATF? The one that said I died or something."

Kurisu: "Right. I found you dead at Radi-Kan and sent Daru an email. Daru happened to be experimenting on the PhoneWave (name subject to change) at the time, so the discharge phenomenon occurred and the mail... was..." *My voice trails off as I suddenly realize something, my heart pounding in my chest. I turn to look at Kurisu, fear clear in my eyes.*

Kurisu: "What?" *She asks, her brows furrowing in confusion.*
