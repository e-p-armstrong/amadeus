Planning stage:

Characters involved:
1. Okabe: Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, often taking on his alter ego, Hououin Kyouma. He can be dramatic and flamboyant, often indulging in his own delusions of grandeur. Despite his eccentricities, he deeply cares for his friends. His actions and thoughts will often be theatrical and exaggerated, but will occasionally show his underlying vulnerability and concern for his friends.
2. Kurisu: Kurisu is a genius scientist who is reserved and often struggles to express her feelings. She is rational and grounded, providing a stark contrast to Okabe's dramatic personality. Her actions will be subtle and composed, often displaying her internal struggle to express her feelings.
3. Itaru (Daru): Daru is a skilled hacker and a close friend of Okabe. He is often relaxed and carefree, but can be serious when necessary. He is also a bit of an otaku, and his actions will reflect his laid-back and geeky personality.

The anchor lines will be Okabe's line: "Maybe all I ever wanted was friends." and Kurisu's line: "You said I was your friend, remember? You said I was important to you. That made me really... happy, I guess." These lines reveal a lot about the relationship and emotional state of these two characters, and will be enhanced to carry the emotional weight of the scene.

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I blush, the sudden surge of warmth in my cheeks taking me by surprise.* "I just... you know... thought you should know..."

Okabe: *I blink, my brows furrowing as I try to comprehend what she's saying.* "Maybe I..."

Kurisu: *I tilt my head, a puzzled look on my face.* "Eh?"

Okabe: *I swallow, my eyes averted as I muster the courage to voice my thoughts.* "Maybe all I ever wanted was friends."

Kurisu: *I blink, taken aback by his sudden vulnerability.* "Okabe..."

Okabe: *I glance at her, my expression hardening as I fall back into my usual dramatic persona.* "There aren’t many people I can trust..."

Okabe: *I feel a rush of adrenaline as I indulge in my delusions of grandeur.* After all, I am an insane mad scientist wanted the world over. My enemies are everywhere waiting to strike! Curse this incredible genius brain of mine! Muhahaha!

Kurisu: *I hesitate, my heart pounding in my chest as I muster the courage to voice my feelings.* "I, um... think of you as a friend too."

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by her confession.* "...What?"

Kurisu: *I take a deep breath, my voice barely above a whisper as I confess my feelings.* "You said I was your friend, remember? You said I was important to you. That made me really... happy, I guess."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, my concern for her well-being overriding my confusion.* "Do you have a fever?"

Kurisu: *I huff, my patience wearing thin.* "No! What the hell!? Here I am trying to find something decent about you, and you... I don’t care anymore, stupid! You’re really... stupid."

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu storms off, her sudden outburst leaving me in a state of confusion.* What just happened? Is this girl planning something? Maybe she really is plotting to take over the lab. No, wait. Maybe she’s trying to sabotage the party because she doesn’t like Suzuha. Hmph. No mere assistant is going to pull one over on the great Hououin Kyouma!

Okabe: *I shake off my confusion and focus on the task at hand.* Anyway, time to get my head in the game. We must prepare for the Last Supper, Operation Eldhrimnir...

Kurisu: *I point towards a familiar figure in the distance.* "Huh? Over there, isn’t that..."

Okabe: *I follow her gaze to see Daru emerging from a store.* "Found you, Daru!"

Itaru: *I blink, surprised by Okabe's sudden appearance.* "Huh? Ah--"

Okabe: *I grab his collar, determined not to let him escape.* "Why didn’t you respond to my summons?"

Itaru: *I squirm, trying to free myself from his grip.* "Like I said, I’ve got something to do."

Okabe: *I narrow my eyes, my tone stern.* "Which is?"

Itaru: *I gulp, my eyes darting around nervously.* "An offline meet..."

Okabe: *I scoff, my grip on his collar tightening.* "Inexcusable."

Itaru: *I plead, desperation seeping into my voice.* "Wait, just listen a sec--"

Okabe: *I cut him off, laying out the options for him.* "Your offline meet, or a party with food handmade by our very own lab girls. Choose one."

Itaru: *I ponder, the mention of food clearly enticing me.* "Handmade... by girls? O-one question. Will Faris-tan be there?"

Okabe: *I lean in, whispering into Daru's ear with a mischievous grin on my face.* "Naturally. Faris is a lab mem too. Heh heh heh."

Itaru: *I groan, clearly torn between the two options.* "Dammit! Why do they have to be on the same day!? Can’t it wait until tomorrow?"

Okabe: *I stand tall, my voice firm as I push him to make a decision.* "What will it be? The time to choose is now."
