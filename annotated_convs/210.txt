Okabe: *I cross my arms, my gaze sharp and intense* "If you give up the offline meet, then that settles it."

Itaru: *I slump in defeat, sighing heavily* "I give up. I give up the offline meeeet!"

Okabe: *Upon our return to the lab, I notice Mayuri and Lukako have already started preparations. Daru's surrender came too quickly, it seems.*

Mayuri: *I look up from my work, a surprised expression on my face* "Huh? Daru-kun’s here too?"

Itaru: *My eyes dart around the lab, a glimmer of hope in my voice* "What about Faris-tan? Where is she?"

Kurisu: *I lean against the wall, crossing my arms with a smirk* "You’ve been tricked."

Mayuri: *I offer an apologetic smile, my voice tinged with regret* "Feris-chan said she couldn’t come."

Itaru: *I whirl around to face Okabe, my voice rising in disbelief* "Wait, seriously!? Okarin! What’s going on here!? This isn’t funny, man!"

Okabe: *I raise a hand in a placating manner, trying to diffuse the situation* "Don’t worry. I’ll make sure she comes to the next one."

Itaru: *I slump in defeat once again, the disappointment clear in my voice* "You’ve gotta be kidding me! I was looking forward to that time machine meet..."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, curiosity piqued* "Time machine meet? What’s that?"

Itaru: *I huff, crossing my arms in indignation* "It’s an offline meet for this sci-fi BBS I post on. Some famous writers are going to be there. I won’t forgive you, Okarin. Ever."

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, my interest piqued* "What? Why didn’t you say so? I would’ve gone too!"

Okabe: *Suddenly, my nose wrinkles at a peculiar scent wafting through the lab* "...Does anyone else smell that?"

Kurisu: *I sniff the air, my brow furrowing in confusion* "Smell what?"

Okabe: *I glance around, trying to locate the source of the scent* "Did we blow a fuse somewhere?"

Luka: *I wring my hands nervously, looking down at the floor in embarrassment* "S-sorry..."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow at Lukako's sudden apology, my curiosity piqued* 

Luka: *I blush, my voice barely above a whisper* "That’s probably the smell of... Mayuri’s cooking..."

Okabe: *My eyes widen in surprise. This is the smell of food?*

Kurisu: *I step forward, offering my help* "I’ll help too."

Luka: *I nod appreciatively, handing her a bowl of eggs* "Okay, then warm these eggs please."

Kurisu: *I glance at the PhoneWave, considering the option* "Hm. Should I use the PhoneWave?"

Luka: *I shake my head vigorously, my voice rising in panic* "N-no! If you put raw eggs in a microwave, they’ll explode!"

Kurisu: *I shrug, a playful smirk on my face* "We took the door off. It should be fine, right?"

Mayuri: *I hum a cheerful tune, chopping away at the vegetables* "Chop, chop, choppity chop, chop, chop, choppity..."

Luka: *I gasp, my eyes widening in horror at Mayuri's reckless handling of the knife* "M-Mayuri-chan! Don’t hold your knife like that!"

Okabe: *I exchange a glance with Daru, both of us at a loss for what to do* "Maybe we should help too. Or at least kick them out of the kitchen?"

Itaru: *I shrug, a resigned look on my face* "Won’t it end up the same either way?"

Okabe: *I clench my fists, my head spinning as I take in the chaotic scene before me. This was not the future I had envisioned.* "I’m getting dizzy. This isn’t the future I was hoping for."

Itaru: *I sigh, shaking my head in disbelief* "You’re telling me. I’ll never forget this, Okarin. Never."

Okabe: *I place a hand on Daru's shoulder, my voice filled with regret* "I’m sorry. Truly. But please, Daru, stay with me to the end."

Itaru: *I pull out my phone, already dialing the number for the pizza place* "I’ll order pizza as insurance."

Okabe: *The situation continues to deteriorate. The smoke grows thicker by the second, filling my lungs with ash and tar. In less than an hour, the girls have transformed the lab into a class five disaster zone. I take out my phone, my hand trembling as I put it to my ear.* "It’s me. Looks like the Evil One is free. If you haven’t heard from me in an hour... tell my parents I love them."

Itaru: *I glance over at Okabe, my expression filled with concern* "Okarin, that’s a death flag..."

Okabe: *I close my eyes, my voice filled with a strange sense of resignation* "Is this the choice of Steins Gate? El Psy Kongroo..."

Itaru: *Once the storm has passed, I collapse onto the couch, exhausted* "Hwahhhh..."

Okabe: *I glance at the clock, my brow furrowing in confusion* "...She’s late."
