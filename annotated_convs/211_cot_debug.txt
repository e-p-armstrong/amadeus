2. Suzuha: "...You’re a nice guy. You know that? I think talking to you really did help." - Highlight Suzuha's gratefulness towards Okabe and her loneliness.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest, the single word in Suzuha's email echoing in my mind. A cold shiver runs down my spine at the thought of her leaving town alone.* "Hououin Kyouma will never accept that!" *I declare, slamming my fist onto the table.* "She will be my guinea pig whether she likes it or not!"

Okabe: *Leaping from my chair, I sprint out of the lab. The streets of Akiba blur as I race towards the station, uncertainty gnawing at my gut. My eyes dart around, scanning the thinning crowd. Time seems to stretch, each passing minute an eternity until finally, I spot a familiar figure.*

Okabe: *My breath catches in my throat.* "...!" *I gasp, my gaze locking onto the figure of Suzuha. Her shoulders are slumped, her head bowed. A pang of concern hits me as I notice her wiping her eyes.* "You there! Part-Time Warrior!" *I call out, my voice cutting through the noise of the station.*

Okabe: *Suzuha looks up, surprise flashing across her face. I see the tracks of tears staining her cheeks. Just as our eyes meet, she looks away and bolts, disappearing into the throng.* "Wait!" *I yell, giving chase, but she's vanished.*

Okabe: *I stop, catching my breath, my mind racing. Why am I chasing her? I shake my head, dismissing the thought. She needs my help, and I will do everything in my power to be there for her.*

Suzuha: *Suddenly, I hear her voice, soft and grateful.* "...You’re a nice guy. You know that? I think talking to you really did help." *Her words echo in my mind, reinforcing my resolve.*

Okabe: *Out of the corner of my eye, I catch a glimpse of someone who looks like Suzuha. But my legs give out, and I collapse to the ground, gasping for breath. I can't find her. I guess this, too, is the choice of Steins Gate.* 

Okabe: *I return to the lab, every step heavy with disappointment. As I push open the door, I'm met with worried faces.*

Mayuri: *Her eyes widen as she sees me.* "Okarin! Did you find Suzu-san?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, my voice weary.* "It’s late. Go home, everyone."

Luka: "But..." *He starts, his voice wavering.*

Kurisu: *Her gaze is firm, demanding.* "Tell us what happened."

Itaru: "Yeah. Keep us in the loop, man." *His voice is steady, offering silent support.*

Okabe: *I sigh, running a hand through my hair.* "Suzuha ran away from me. I guess she couldn’t find her father."
