Okabe: *I tilt my head, studying Suzuha with a scrutinizing gaze.* "You couldn’t find your father, so we held the ’Last Supper’ to make you a test subject. Correct?"

Suzuha: *I laugh, a little sheepishly.* "Ahaha! Yeah, I remember you saying something like that. Thanks for all your help yesterday."

Okabe: *I furrow my brows, trying to remember the events of the previous night.* "...My memory’s a bit fuzzy. Remind me again how we captured you."

Suzuha: *I look at Okabe, my eyes wide in surprise.* "Wait, were you really drinking last night?"

Okabe: *I wave her question away impatiently.* "Just tell me."

Suzuha: *I nod, recalling the events.* "Well, I was on my way home from the time machine meet when--"

Okabe: *I interrupt her, my eyes widening in shock.* "Woah, wait a second. Time machine meet!?"

Suzuha: *I smile, nodding my head.* "Yup."

Okabe: *A realization dawns on me.* "Was that where your father was supposed to appear?"

Suzuha: *I give Okabe a knowing look.* "I said so yesterday, didn’t I?"

Okabe: *I nod, urging her to continue.* "So you were going home, and then?"

Suzuha: *I recall the events, a smile playing on my lips.* "You, Hashida Itaru, and Shiina Mayuri appeared out of nowhere. You brought me to the lab, and we partied all night long."

Okabe: *A grin spreads across my face.* "So my pursuit of Suzuha was a resounding success."

Suzuha: *I look back up at the clear blue sky, a content smile on my face.* "Yesterday sure was fun..." *I pause for a moment, my smile turning into a small frown.* "It would’ve been more fun if not for Makise Kurisu. The apple pie she made was deadly. But Urushibara Luka’s curry was awesome. Your lab seems kinda like... umm... like a clubhouse? It’s nice. Everyone gets along, and you’re always smiling... I’ve never had so much fun in my life."

Okabe: *I chuckle, feeling a sense of pride at her words.* "Part-Time Warrior. As promised, you are now my test subject."

Suzuha: *I tilt my head, a little confused.* "But I already told you. I don’t know his email address."

Okabe: *I shrug nonchalantly.* "Then we’ll have to postpone the experiment until you find out. By the way, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) used in the experiment is our lab’s greatest secret. You must become a lab mem to guarantee your silence."

Suzuha: *I blink, surprised.* "Lab mem?"

Okabe: *I nod, a grand smile on my face.* "Short for laboratory member. When you become a lab mem, you become one of us."

Suzuha: *I pause, uncertainty flashing in my eyes.* "...Can I really join?"

Okabe: *I laugh, clapping her on the shoulder.* "You don’t have a choice in the matter! From this day forth, you are Lab Mem 008!"

Suzuha: *I lower my head, a small sniffle escaping me. Then, I look up, a genuine smile on my face.* "I guess I don’t have a choice, huh? I’m all yours."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, intrigued by her response.* "...You’re not going to leave?"

Suzuha: *I shake my head, a determined look in my eyes.* "Nope. Maybe there’s still a chance to find my dad."

Okabe: *I nod, feeling a sense of camaraderie.* "You are a lab mem now. If there’s anything we can do, you need only ask. By the way, do you have any leads?"

Suzuha: *I hesitate for a moment, then stand up and turn to Okabe. My expression is grave.* "My father calls himself Titor."

Okabe: *My eyes widen in shock, disbelief washing over me.* "Wait, Titor? As in that Titor!?"

Suzuha: *I nod, a hopeful glint in my eyes.* "You know about him? He might be using a different codename, though."
