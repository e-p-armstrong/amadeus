Suzuha: *I turn my gaze from the screen to Okabe, a hint of surprise flickering across my face.* "Huh... you’re right."

Okabe: *I furrow my brows, surprised by her lack of reaction.* "Hey. Shouldn’t you be more surprised?"

Suzuha: *I shrug, a small smile playing on my lips.* "Well... it’s not him."

Okabe: *My eyes widen, and I lean forward, resting my elbows on the desk.* "How do you know? You just said your father calls himself Titor!"

Suzuha: *With a firm nod, I meet Okabe's gaze, my expression resolute.* "I can tell. This Titor isn’t my dad."

Okabe: *Her strange response throws me off, leaving me to wonder if she knows something more.* 

Suzuha: *I take a deep breath, my eyes drifting off as if looking into the past.* "His name’s not John. The name my father used was... Barrel Titor." *The words slip out of my mouth, each syllable tinged with a longing for a past that's just out of reach.*
