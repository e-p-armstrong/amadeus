Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest, each beat echoing in the silent void that surrounds me.* "This is a dream, right?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head slightly, my eyes reflecting a wisdom that seems out of place.* "Mayushii went looking for you, and found Okarins from many, maaaany worldlines. You’re one of many Okarins, and also the original. Mayushii is one of many Mayushiis, and also the original. And now, Okarin and Mayushii are going to die here."

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my throat dry as sand.* "This is a dream... right, Mayuri?"

Mayuri: *I smile, a soft, sad expression that does nothing to comfort me.* "But... I know that another Okarin and Mayushii will pick up where we left off, 70 million years in the future. So everything’s A-OK♪"

Okabe: *My breath catches in my throat, the realization hitting me like a punch to the gut.* "This... is a dream! Guh!"

Okabe: *I jerk awake on the sofa, my body drenched in sweat.* "...It was a dream."

Okabe: *I glance around the room, my heart still racing from the nightmare. Mayuri is right where I expect to find her, in front of the TV, a RaiNet Kakeru DVD playing.* "I wish I had an Upa..."

Okabe: *I can't help but smile at her innocent comment. Checking my phone, I find no new emails. I sent Titor a mail several hours ago, just to make sure that he really isn’t Suzuha’s father. He hasn’t replied yet. Obviously, Daru and the others don’t know that I changed the past. Instead, they remember partying with Suzuha all night long. It was strange listening to them talk happily about an event I attended, but do not remember. My phone suddenly starts to ring. It's Faris. I groan internally.* "This is Hououin Kyouma."

Faris: *I greet Okabe coyly.* "Nyaon♪ It’s Faris, nyan."

Okabe: *I try to keep my voice steady, though the sudden call caught me off guard.* "Oh, it’s you, Akiha Rumiho."

Faris: *Gah! I stifle a tsk when I hear my own name. Why can't people just let me have my fun the moment they learn who I actually am? I stay in-character.* "Nya? Who’s that, nya?"

Okabe: *A cold shiver runs down my spine. Could the D-Mail, our message to the past, have changed Faris's name, too?* 

Faris: "Faris is Faris, nya. I don’t have any other names, nya."

Okabe: *I let out a sigh of relief, shaking my head at her usual antics.* "Yeah, right. Your True Name is Faris. My apologies."

Okabe: *I lean back on the sofa, still trying to shake off the remnants of my dream.* "Well, what is it?"
