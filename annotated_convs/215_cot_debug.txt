Okabe: "Whoa!" *I exclaim as I rush into the building, narrowly escaping a sudden downpour.*

Kurisu: "What the hell!?" *She follows closely behind me, her scream barely audible over the roar of the rainfall.*

Kurisu: *Shaking off the water from her clothes, she sighs.* "Whew, what a surprise."

Okabe: "That's what you get for tempting the sky gods." *I reply with a playful smirk.*

Kurisu: "You should've warned me sooner. Even my underwear's soaked." *She mutters, looking down at her drenched clothes.*

Okabe: "Same here. I bet you're glad it's dark, huh?" *I quip, glancing at her.*

Kurisu: "What do you mean?" *She asks, furrowing her brow in confusion.*

Okabe: "If the lights were on, I'd be able to see everything." *I say, trying to suppress a chuckle.*

Kurisu: *She gasps, quickly wrapping her arms around her chest.* "...!"

Okabe: "You're the one who announced that your underwear was wet." *I retort, pointing out her blunder.*

Kurisu: "J-just drop it! If you're imagining what color my underwear is, I'll kill you!" *Her voice quivers, a mix of anger and embarrassment.*

Okabe: "I'm not imagining anything." *I reply nonchalantly, leaning against the wall.*

Kurisu: "Achoo!" *She sneezes, her body shivering from the cold.*

Okabe: "Cold?" *I ask, raising an eyebrow at her.*

Kurisu: "I'm not stripping naked, if that's what you're suggesting! Your pervy tricks won't work on me!" *She retorts, her voice defensive.*

Okabe: "Who said strip!? Calm down, will you!?" *I reply, raising my hands in a placating gesture.*

Kurisu: "Grr..." *She grumbles, crossing her arms over her chest.*

Okabe: "But if you want to strip, go right ahead. I can't make out your scrawny figure in this light anyway." *I tease, trying to lighten the mood.*

Kurisu: "Another word, and I'll make you eat your cerebral neocortex with ponzu sauce!" *She threatens, her voice stern.*

Okabe: "S-sorry." *I say, raising my hands in surrender.*

Kurisu: "H-hey, get your own stair! W-what?" *She stammers as I sit down next to her on the stairs.*

Okabe: "You're the one who said not to speak." *I reply, keeping my voice low.*

Kurisu: "Y-you're too close... Don't come any closer, okay? You can stay where you are, but come any closer, and I'll push you away, okay?" *She warns, shifting uncomfortably on the stair.*

Okabe: "Impossible! How can you see where I'm looking!?" *I exclaim, looking at her in astonishment.*

Kurisu: "So you were looking." *She accuses, her voice low.*

Okabe: "Damn. Must have caught on something when we ran inside." *I mutter, feeling a tear in my lab coat.*

Kurisu: "What are you talking about?" *She asks, turning her head in my direction.*

Okabe: "Just a little tear in my coat." *I explain, holding up the torn fabric for her to see.*

Kurisu: "Is clumsiness one of your character traits?" *She teases, a hint of amusement in her voice.*

Okabe: "Don't be ridiculous. I am a mad scientist. I bear the curse of insanity, not clumsiness." *I retort, puffing out my chest.*

Kurisu: "Yeah, yeah. Give it here." *She extends her hand, offering to fix my coat.*

Okabe: "A sewing kit? You?" *I ask, raising an eyebrow in surprise.*

Kurisu: "Something wrong with that?" *She replies, her tone challenging.*

Okabe: "You're an experiment-loving girl. You're not supposed to be... domestic." *I comment, handing her my coat.*

Kurisu: "Can't I be a domestic experiment-loving girl?" *She retorts, threading a needle with practiced ease.*

Okabe: "You? Domestic?" *I ask, disbelief evident in my tone.*

Kurisu: "Relatively, maybe. Well, actually, I don't know the domesticity index for Japanese high school girls these days." *She responds, a smirk playing on her lips.*
