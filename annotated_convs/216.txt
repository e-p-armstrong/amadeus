Okabe: *I blink, my brow furrowing in confusion.* "Hah?" *I contemplate whether this is just another one of Faris's usual role-play scenarios.*

Faris: *I twirl a lock of my hair around my finger, a playful grin on my face.* "The Four Guardian Kings have awakened, nya. There’s no escape, nyan."

Okabe: *I smirk, attempting to hide my unease.* "Heh. Is that so? If you think the Four Guardian Kings can stop me, just wait and see. Akiba will be drowning in blood before nightfall."

Faris: *I lean back in my chair, my eyes sparkling with mischief.* "After the Four Guardian Kings are the Four Guardian Queens, nya. After that, it’s the Eight Devils, and then the Black Angel Twelve, nya."

Okabe: *I gulp, my eyes widening.* "Th-that many!? What’s going on in this town..."

Faris: *I sigh, a hint of regret in my voice.* "You’ve really stirred up a hornet’s nest, nya. I’m sorry, Kyouma, but this is checkmate, nyan."

Okabe: *I clench my fist, my gaze hardening.* "No, it’s not over yet. If I can just acquire the item, I can turn the tide! Have you still not located an IBN 5100!?" *My words echo with desperation and urgency.*

Faris: *I shake my head, my eyes filled with apology.* "Sorry, nya. I have agents looking all over the world, but still no luck, nya."

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my heart sinking.* "Please hurry. I’m running out of time."

Faris: *I nod, determination in my eyes.* "Okay, nya! I’ll tell you as soon as I find one, Kyouma. Until then... hold on to your nine lives, nyan."

Okabe: *I nod, my lips parting to speak.* "Yeah, I can’t die yet... El Psy Ko--" *But before I can finish, I hear the click of the phone disconnecting. Annoyed, I shove my phone into my pocket, wiping the sweat off my brow.*

Mayuri: *I cheerfully pick up my phone, a bright smile on my face.* "Tutturu♪ Mayushii here. Ah, Feris-chan. Good mornyan♪"

Okabe: *My eye twitches at the sound of that name again, but I keep my composure.*

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, looking at Okabe.* "Kyouma? Oh, you mean Okarin? Yup, he’s here. Wanna talk to him?"

Okabe: *I quickly cross my arms in an X shape, shaking my head. The last thing I want is to talk to Faris again.*

Mayuri: *I blink in surprise, then nod.* "Hmm? Um, it looks like he can’t talk. ...yup. ...mmhmm. Ok, I’ll tell him. Byebye♪"

Okabe: *I stride up to Mayuri, my eyes meeting hers.* "Well done, Mayuri. You’ll make a fine assistant yet. What did Faris want?"

Mayuri: *I shrug, a soft smile on my face.* "Well, she said that the Four Guardian Kings have assembled in Akiba, so be careful."

Okabe: *I scoff, dismissing the information as Faris's usual nonsense.* "Don’t tell me that’s all she said?"

Mayuri: *I nod, recalling the conversation.* "Um, she also hasn’t found an IBN 5100 yet. She said if she does find one, she’ll contact you nyan."
