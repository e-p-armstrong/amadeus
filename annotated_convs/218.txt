Kurisu: *pushes me away, trembling with barely-contained fury* "...Kuh!"
Kurisu: "This is ridiculous! You... motherfucker!" *She glares at me, her eyes cutting through the tension like knives.*
Okabe: "Whoa!" *I raise my hands defensively.*
Kurisu: "I said I was fine! What do you mean you won't give up!? Are you stupid? Wanna die? Are you trying to be a hero, you chuunibyou wackjob? Don't make promises you can't keep! Your stupidity is infuriating! Why can't you just do as I say!?" *She yells, each sentence punctuated by her finger stabbing in my direction.*
Okabe: "I..." *I struggle to find the words, my voice fading under her onslaught.*
Kurisu: "What's the problem, huh!? If you weigh the options logically, saving Mayuri is the only--" *Her voice is almost pleading.*
Okabe: "Fuck logic!" *My voice rises, overriding her, and I clench my fists.*
Kurisu: "...!" *Her eyes widen in disbelief, her mouth falling open.*
Okabe: "I'm not God! Maybe I got close, but that's not me! I can't decide who lives and who dies anymore!" *I catch my breath, my own words hitting me hard.* Suzuha. Faris. Lukako. I sacrificed their happiness to save Mayuri. And the whole time, a voice in the back of my head was asking... Is this really okay? What gives me the right?
Okabe: "This time..." *I pause, taking a deep breath to steady myself.* "This time, I want to save both of them, without sacrificing anyone."
Kurisu: "Hmph!" *She turns away, tapping her foot in irritation.* "There's nothing you can do. It's the choice of Steins Gate. Isn't that what you always say? The equation is proven, Okabe. There's no escape. You're just one man. No matter how hard you try, you can't overcome the will of the universe."
Okabe: "I know... but I'm still going to try!" *My eyes meet hers, full of determination.* I won't lose Mayuri or Kurisu.
Kurisu: "Kuh..." *I hear her grinding her teeth, then she turns her back to me.* "Have it your way! But I'm not helping. I'm going back to America, and that's that. Goodbye. I don't expect we'll meet again, Hououin Kyouma."
Okabe: "Kuh..." *I feel my own teeth grinding as I grapple with the reality of her words.*
Kurisu: "I can't believe this! How stupid can you be? You're so... stupid!" *Her words hang heavy in the air, as she walks away, leaving me standing alone.*
