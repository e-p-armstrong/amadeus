Plan:
Okabe: The protagonist, intelligent and a bit paranoid, often lost in his thoughts and theories. His actions should reflect his constant theorizing and obsession with the idea of conspiracy.
Itaru: The tech expert, casual, laid-back but very competent. His actions should reflect his expertise and casual demeanor.
Mayuri: The innocent, cheerful and curious character. Her actions should be reflective of her naive and cheerful personality.
Kurisu: The serious, focused scientist. Her actions should reflect her seriousness and focus.

The anchor lines will be Okabe's realization of SERN's possible foresight and Kurisu's sudden appearance from the development room. These lines carry significant weight in terms of narrative progression and emotional impact.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I run my fingers across the keyboard, the screen reflecting the unusual speed of our connection.* "There's only one step..." *My mind races, piecing together the implications.* We're directly connected to SERN, bypassing any intermediate servers. This machine, dubbed AKIHABARA_PC, is our direct line to France. But why? 

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, a wide grin spreading across my face.* "And the transfer rate is hundreds of times better than usual. Crazy fast! You can't even get these numbers domestically, man."

Okabe: *I turn to Itaru, my eyebrows furrowed in confusion.* "Why do we have a direct line? Is this even possible?"

Itaru: *I shrug, the smile never leaving my face.* "It was like this when we found it. I didn't do anything."

Okabe: *I rub my chin, deep in thought.* "So the building already had a hotline to SERN? This can't be a coincidence. It might just be the choice of Stei--"

Itaru: *I interrupt Okabe, my eyes wide with excitement.* "It doesn't make sense. Why would there be an independent line running from here all the way to SERN?"

Okabe: *I nod, my mind racing with possibilities.* "SERN did it themselves." *I turn to Itaru, who gulps and nods in agreement. His face is slick with cold sweat, mirroring my own rising tension.* We are in the open. SERN could be watching our every move. Or maybe they have been expecting us for years. The thought is chilling. 

Itaru: *I wipe the sweat from my brow, managing a weak smile.* "But thanks to this direct line, we can now control the LHC remotely."

Okabe: *I look at Itaru in surprise.* "You figured out how!?"

Mayuri: *I pause my DVD and hurry over to Itaru, clapping my hands in excitement.* "Wow! That's amazing, Daru-kun."

Itaru: *I nod, my smile returning.* "With a connection this fast, we can control the LHC practically in real-time. I haven't actually tried it yet, though."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a look of curiosity on my face.* "The LHC is that 20-kilometer-long tunnel thing, right? Um, what does it do again?"

Okabe: *I look at Mayuri, trying to simplify the concept for her.* "It accelerates protons and smashes them together."

Mayuri: *I nod, remembering the explanation.* "Oh yeah. Mini black holes, right?"

Itaru: *I shake my head, correcting her.* "The official line is that mini black holes might manifest as a byproduct of the particle collision, but that's not the truth."

Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, the gravity of our discovery weighing on me.* "According to the top secret documents we found, the LHC was intended to create black holes from the very beginning." *But how do they do it? We need to figure out a way to--*

Kurisu: *I emerge from the development room, my expression grave.* "Okabe."

Okabe: *I turn to look at Kurisu, her sudden appearance and serious demeanor taking me aback.* "What's wrong?"
