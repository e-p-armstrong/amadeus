Okabe: *I turn around in surprise, locking eyes with Kurisu who stands in the doorway.* I thought she never wanted to see me again. Why is she here? "Why..." *My voice trails off as I clench my fists, lost in thought.*

Kurisu: "Time leaping is just running away." *She fixes me with her usual glare, her eyes piercing through my facade.*

Okabe: *I shake my head slowly.* You don't have to tell me. I already know. I know all too well. In the end, all I'm doing is running away. Running from responsibility. Running from the decision. If I had known I would have to make this choice, then I would have refused Suzuha when she entrusted me with her mission. "I've hurt people... lots of people... just to save Mayuri." *I look down, avoiding her gaze.* "And yet, I don't even feel guilty anymore. I feel like I'm losing my humanity."

Kurisu: "Then why are you hesitating now?" *Her eyes narrow, challenging me to confront my own contradictions.*

Okabe: "...Maybe because my insurance, the Time Leap Machine, isn't effective. Or maybe I just haven't mastered it yet. Maybe I haven't tapped into its full potential." *I nervously adjust my lab coat, a subconscious attempt to shield myself.*

Kurisu: "Running only makes it hurt more." *She suddenly looks away, her words heavy with unspoken meaning.* "I should know." *Her voice wavers for just a moment, revealing a glimpse of her own pain.*

Okabe: *I rub my temples, feeling the weight of her words sink in.* She's right. I have no other options left. No more D-Mails. No more time leaps. There's no perfect world where both Kurisu and Mayuri live. Maybe there are things I have yet to try, but I'm certain that all of them will end in vain. As long as I stay on this worldline, Mayuri will die. And if I go to the Beta worldline, Kurisu will die. We'll never be able to talk like this again. It's only been twenty days since we met, and yet... Memories of Kurisu flash before my eyes.

Kurisu: "Look at yourself, Okabe. You look like you've aged a decade. Your heart can't take it anymore." *She steps closer, her eyes searching mine.* "You don't need to beat yourself up like this. Just accept the truth. Like I said, you can't stay here. Go to the Beta worldline. Go to the world where Mayuri doesn't die. Not just for your sake, but for mine as well." *She holds my gaze, unflinching.*

Okabe: *I let out a long sigh, finally accepting the gravity of her words.* 

Kurisu: "Thank you. I know you're hurting for me." *She smiles earnestly.*
