Okabe: *As the realization strikes me, my fingers clutch the edge of the table, my eyes wide with the implications of what I've just uncovered.* "So, if the LHC was created to generate mini black holes-- Then the PhoneWave (name subject to change) must also produce mini black holes!"

Kurisu: *Her brows furrow, the gears in her mind visibly turning as she processes the information. She doesn't deny it, and her silence is an agreement in itself.* "It’s a miracle that thing has been so stable. But there’s still one thing I don’t understand. Even if it does produce mini black holes, they should evaporate instantly. But that’s not what happens in the PhoneWave. The gelification phenomenon proves that. Just like in the LHC, our mini black holes are turning into Kerr black holes."

Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, steepling my fingers as I digest her words.* "According to Titor, you have to inject electrons to produce the Kerr black hole effect."

Kurisu: *Her gaze is steady, almost challenging as she poses the next question.* "Where do the injected electrons come from? That’s what I don’t understand. The LHC uses something called a lifter to inject electrons into the black hole and control the gravitational field. Something is filling that role inside the PhoneWave."

Itaru: *His voice wavers slightly, the uncertainty clear in his tone.* "S-something?"

Kurisu: *She shrugs, a small sigh escaping her lips.* "Like I said, I don’t know what."

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, my mind racing as I process her words. It seems that our hypothesis about the PhoneWave (name subject to change) functioning the same as the LHC is confirmed.* "Looks like we need to review what the LHC is."

Itaru: *I can see the anticipation in his eyes, a spark of excitement that's been absent until now. This is his time to shine.* "LHC stands for Large Hadron Collider."

Mayuri: *Her voice is a sweet lilt, filled with curiosity and innocence.* "Had drawn?"

Kurisu: *She answers simply, a hint of a smile playing at the corners of her mouth.* "It’s the name of an elementary particle."

Itaru: *His voice gains confidence as he delves into his explanation, the words flowing with a passion that's uniquely his.* "The LHC is basically a huge circular tunnel underneath Switzerland and France. It sits about 100 meters below ground, and has a total length of 27 kilometers. There are two rings that run through the tunnel. Inside the rings is a super-low-temperature vacuum -- an environment like outer space, basically. Seriously moe. In an adjacent facility, protons are gradually accelerated by the linear accelerator, the Proton Synchrotron Booster, and the Super Proton Synchrotron. Finally, they’re injected into the LHC, where they undergo their final acceleration via a series of superconducting magnets installed in the tunnel. By now, they’re traveling at up to 99. 9999991% the speed of light. That’s enough to melt your brain. Not as dangerous as the PhoneWave, though. Finally, the accelerated protons collide approximately 1 to 10 billion times per second. The purpose of the LHC project is to study the high energy reactions that result... or so they say. We know they’re a bunch of stinking liars."

Okabe: *I nod in understanding, absorbing his detailed explanation. It's a lot to take in, but it's essential for our research.* "And that, my fellow lab members, brings us to the question. Can the PhoneWave (name subject to change) beat SERN to true physical time travel?"

Kurisu: *She raises two fingers, her tone grave.* "Two problems. One, setting the destination. Two, the lifter."

Okabe: *I cross my arms, my gaze steady.* "We’ve already established that the D-Mail arrives precisely when and where it’s supposed to."

Kurisu: *Her eyes narrow slightly, the skepticism clear.* "...It’s dangerous to accept that without verification."

Okabe: *I nod, acknowledging her caution.* "As for the lifter, we already know it exists. We just need to figure out what it is."
