Kurisu: "Wha..." *Kurisu stumbles over her words, looking down and shuffling her feet. She usually glares at me harshly, but now she's avoiding my eyes.*

Okabe: "I don't ever want to forget... so let's make doubly sure." *I decide to take the initiative. I wrap my arm gently around Kurisu's waist and pull her slender body against mine, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Kurisu: "Th-then I guess there's no choice..." *She looks up at me, biting her lower lip for a moment before releasing it.*

Kurisu: "Just a kiss... okay?" *Her voice trembles slightly, filled with a mix of anticipation and caution. What is she worried I'll do?*

Kurisu: "Be gentle... okay?" *She brings her eyes to meet mine as I nod, understanding.*

Okabe: *I run my fingers softly through her hair and bend down, capturing her lips with my own.* 

Kurisu: "Okabe... Mm..." *Our lips meet, her arms tentatively wrapping around my neck. Tears form in the corners of her eyes.*

Okabe: *I notice the tears trickling down her cheeks. We draw back for a moment, and I gently kiss her tears away. They're salty.* 

Kurisu: "Don't forget me..." *She mutters, her voice filled with a palpable sense of yearning.*

Okabe: *We press our lips together again, stronger and longer this time, our arms tightening around each other, consumed by emotions we can't contain.*

Kurisu: "mm..." *Her grip tightens momentarily before easing as she leans her head against my chest.*

Okabe: *We seek each other's warmth, lost in an embrace so intimate it's as if we're trying to meld into one another.* 

Kurisu: "It's too fast..." *Her whisper almost gets lost, but it resonates through our locked forms.*

Kurisu: "Time is going by too fast. I could really use a word with Einstein right now. Time is not absolute. Einstein proved that time could be fast or slow, depending on the observer. Hey, Okabe. The theory of relativity is so romantic... ...and so sad, don't you think?" *Her voice trails off, tinged with a melancholy I can't shake.*

Okabe: *Standing at the entrance of Akihabara Station, I see Kurisu waiting with a large suitcase. I approach, my steps faltering as she waves and then replaces her wave with her usual glare. She's leaving, and her suitcase makes it final.*

Kurisu: "...Well then." *She pauses, her lips pressed tight as if restraining something.*

Okabe: "Are you sure I shouldn't call Mayuri and Daru?" *I ask, my voice tinged with reluctance.*

Kurisu: "...I think that would just make it harder. But you, I have no trouble leaving behind. ...That was a joke." *Her eyes water up, and she quickly blinks back tears.*

Okabe: "This is a souvenir. Take it." *I hand her Future Gadget No. 2: The Bamboo Helicam. A truly groundbreaking invention, but one that's utterly ridiculous at the same time.*

Kurisu: "Uh... no thanks." *She hesitates, eyeing the gadget skeptically.*

Okabe: "Just take it. It's not even that bulky." *I insist, almost pleading.*

Kurisu: "Oh, fine. I guess I'll take it." *She finally relents, accepting the gadget with a half-smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes.*

Okabe: "Sorry I couldn't go with you to Aomori..." *The words come out tinged with regret.*

Kurisu: "Yeah... But these two weeks were fun, in their own way. Give my regards to Mayuri and Hashida, okay?" *She opens her arms wide, a clear invitation.*

Okabe: *Without a second thought, I step into her open arms and we share a heartfelt embrace.* 

Kurisu: "Hang in there, Okabe." *She whispers, her words imbued with a strength she probably wishes she felt.*
