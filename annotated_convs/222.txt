Okabe: "With unimaginable brilliance and unwavering conviction, I have defeated our vast and powerful enemy and now stand triumphant on the field of Ragnarok!" *I puff out my chest, passion filling my voice* "I give thanks to the comrades... whose sacrifice made this victory possible!" *I grip my coat at the shoulder, where jagged pink thread holds it together, the symbol of the sacrifices made.*

Daru: *He twitches, anxiety painted across his face, but he remains silent, watching me intently.*

Okabe: "The coming world... is the world I wished for!" *I proclaim, taking a deep breath as if to gather my courage.*

Okabe: "This is the choice of Steins Gate!" *I raise my index finger, poised to press the key, and I feel a momentary hesitation* "Let the world be reborn!" 

*I swing down my index finger. And at that exact same moment, the lab door bursts open, pulling my attention away from the computer.* 

Kurisu: "--!" *She stands in the doorway, panting lightly as if she'd run here. Her eyes lock onto mine, shining with an emotion I can't name.*

Okabe: *In that frozen instant, her eyes communicate a universe of unspoken words. My finger finally presses the enter key, setting into motion the irreversible.*

UNSPOKEN: *The world begins to distort. The timeline starts its irrevocable shift. I feel my consciousness being pulled into the vortex of change. Mayuri, Daru, and especially Kurisu, all blur into the chaotic mosaic of a world being rewritten.*

Okabe: *As colors fade and the world dissolves, I turn my gaze toward Kurisu, desperate to etch this final image of her into my memory.* 

Kurisu: "Goodbye. Okabe, I lo--" *She begins, raising her hand in a motion to wave, but her words are swallowed as my consciousness leaves this timeline.*
