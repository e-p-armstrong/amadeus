Okabe: *With a furrowed brow and a look of intense curiosity, I lean closer to Kurisu, eager to understand.* "What does that mean? How is it different from what you see in sci-fi novels?"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, pressing my lips together as I gather my thoughts.* "Time leaping in sci-fi usually sends everything -- consciousness, personality, and memory. But in real life, there’s probably too much data, and besides, we only analyzed memories. Think of consciousness, personality, and memory as separate things." *I hold out my hand, spreading my fingers wide, as if to physically separate the three concepts.* "Memories are like the video data stored on your computer. And consciousness and personality are like the OS."

Itaru: *I chuckle, scratching the back of my head.* "But videos can take up way more space than the OS."

Kurisu: *With a nod of agreement, I continue.* "It’s just an example. For starters, it’s still not clear where personality and consciousness are located, or how they are constructed. So we can’t convert them into data. Or at least, I can’t."

Okabe: *I stroke my chin, considering her words.* "So we can only send memories. Where does that leave us?"

Kurisu: *I look Okabe directly in the eyes, trying to convey the weight of the situation.* "Your memories aren’t the only thing that define you. Even if you send your memories to the past, it will be the receiving you’s consciousness and personality that process them."

Itaru: *With a cheeky grin, I try to lighten the mood.* "So in Mindorz terms, it’s like copying data from a VISTA computer to a Min95 computer?"

Kurisu: *I sigh, exasperated, but I can't help a small smile.* "Data created with the latest OS might not work on an older OS. It might cause errors. For example, if you sent your current memories to yourself in elementary school, the gap between your memories and your body could have serious consequences."

Okabe: *I nod slowly, taking in the gravity of her words.* "Anyway, is it correct to assume that we’ll be targeting ourselves in the past?"

Kurisu: *I confirm his assumption with a slight nod.* "Just like with D-Mail, we’re using cellphones as the transfer medium. To be precise, you can only leap into your own body, and only if you had a cellphone at the time of reception."

Okabe: *I recall an exception to this rule, but push the thought aside.* 

Kurisu: *I hesitate, searching for the right words.* "If you try sending memories to someone else... umm, how do I put this... there’s a danger that the electrical signals might be rejected."

Itaru: *I chuckle, imagining the possibilities.* "Wouldn’t want to jump into someone else’s body. I mean, unless it’s the body of a cute girl. Uhehe!"

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, wondering if Itaru is capable of a non-perverted thought.*

Kurisu: *I snap at him, my patience wearing thin.* "Don’t ’uhehe’ me, you idiot! If it just bounces off, that’s fine, but I’m worried incompatible memory data might do serious damage to the recipient’s psyche. I don’t know what might happen. No one’s done it before, after all."

Okabe: *A thrill of excitement runs through me. The unknown is what makes us pioneers.*

Kurisu: *I hold up two fingers, emphasizing my point.* "There are two things I do know. One, you definitely cannot go back before you were born; and two, you won’t exist in two places at once. That means you don’t have to worry about causing a paradox. You can’t kill your parents before you were born."

Okabe: *A realization dawns on me.* "So the phones act like black and white holes..."
