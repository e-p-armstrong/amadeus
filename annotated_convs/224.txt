Okabe: *I whip out my phone with a flourish, holding it to my ear as if it's a conduit to a world beyond.* "It’s me. Everything is falling into place. The plan can now proceed to the final stage. I’m talking about Operation Verthandi, obviously. Heh. Christina had me fooled. I never knew she was capable of this. It must have been the choice of Steins Gate that sent her here. Don’t worry. I have everything under control. Nothing can stop us now. El Psy Kongroo." *I put away my phone, a smirk playing on my lips, and turn to face Kurisu.* "Were you listening? Good. Commence preparations for Operation Verthandi!"

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, crossing my arms over my chest.* "First, explain what that is!"

Okabe: *I thrust a finger towards her, a triumphant grin on my face.* "We’re going to build your time leap machine, Christina. And you’d better not say it can’t be done! Not after showing me the way!"

Kurisu: *I look at him, my expression thoughtful.* "Well, this is Akihabara. I should be able to find the parts I need."

Okabe: *I nod, my eyes gleaming with excitement.* "Then it’s decided. I’m placing you in charge of this operation. Whatever you need, ask, and it shall be yours. Together, we shall complete the first time leap machine in human history!" *I watch as Kurisu nods, her eyes shining with a fierce, hungry light. As I thought. She’s a scientist to the core! Mayuri and Daru go home, leaving me with Kurisu. She’s sitting in the development room chair, endlessly twirling a pen in her fingers.* "What are you doing?"

Kurisu: *I glance up at him, my fingers still twirling the pen.* "Thinking about the time leap machine. I know we can make it, but I’m wondering what will happen if we actually use it."

Okabe: *I scratch my head, a small chuckle escaping my lips.* "Ah. You’re thinking too hard. Finish the machine, then worry about it."

Kurisu: *I glare at him, my hand freezing mid-twirl.* "You’re so pompous." *Exasperated, I let out a groan and flop down on the desk. It’s strange to see her like this. She’s usually so cool and collected. But maybe that’s an act, and this is who she really is.* 

Kurisu: *I lift my head, my gaze meeting his.* "Hey, Okabe... Can I talk to you about something completely unrelated?"

Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, crossing my arms over my chest.* "I’d rather talk about something related."

Kurisu: *I frown, my fingers tapping a rhythm on the desk.* "You told me before that I could ask you anything. Remember?"

Okabe: *I blink, racking my brain for the memory. I did? I don’t remember that.* 

Kurisu: *I take a deep breath, my fingers tightening around the pen.* "I think... my father hates me." *Her voice is barely a whisper, the words hanging in the air like a confession. This is the emotional anchor of the scene, the moment where Kurisu's usually guarded exterior cracks, revealing her vulnerability beneath.*
