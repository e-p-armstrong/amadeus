Brainstorming/Plan:
Characters involved:
1. Kurisu Makise: A genius scientist with a cold and professional exterior, but underneath hides a deep vulnerability and yearning for familial connection. Her actions/thoughts will be conveyed in a more analytical and composed manner, even when emotional.
2. Okabe Rintarou: A self-proclaimed mad scientist with a dramatic flair. He's observant and has a keen understanding of others. His actions and thoughts will be exaggerated and dramatic, yet insightful.

Anchor Lines:
1. Kurisu: "...Yeah. I don’t remember the last time he had a kind word for me. Even when we were living together, before I went to America, he acted like I wasn’t there. We’re supposed to be family, aren’t we?" - This line reveals Kurisu's vulnerability and longing for familial connection. I will amplify this by adding more emotional weight and desolation in her actions.
2. Kurisu: "No... he doesn’t want to see me. That’s what we were talking about on the phone. I asked if we could meet, but he told me to stay away from him." - This line signifies the rejection Kurisu feels from her father. I'll add actions that portray her struggle to keep her emotions in check.

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I scoff lightly, a smirk playing on my lips, concealing the lingering bitterness within.* "Heh... you really are pompous."

Okabe: *I lean back, my gaze steady on Kurisu, as I recall the memory.* "I assume it was your father on the phone the other day?"

Okabe: *My mind conjures the image of Kurisu, outside the lab, her face wet with tears as she clung desperately to her phone. The moment was fragile, like the silence before a storm.*

Kurisu: *I pause, my fingers tracing patterns on the tabletop, my eyes distant.* "...Yeah. I don’t remember the last time he had a kind word for me. Even when we were living together, before I went to America, he acted like I wasn’t there. We’re supposed to be family, aren’t we?"

Okabe: *I tilt my head, studying her, my voice carrying a curious note.* "And you? How did you treat your father?"

Kurisu: *I let out a soft laugh, a hollow echo of a cherished past.* "I was daddy’s little girl growing up. You practically had to drag me away from him."

Kurisu: *A wistful smile dances on my lips, bittersweet and tinged with a self-deprecating humor.* "My father’s a physicist. Even as a child, I loved to hear him talk about science. I couldn’t understand a word of it, but I always begged him to explain. I wanted to understand his work, so I started studying physics. I must have been five."

Okabe: *I whistle low, a spark of admiration in my eyes.* Damn. I guess that’s what makes her a genius. Or perhaps the yearning for her father’s love was what gave birth to her genius.

Kurisu: *I continue, my voice gaining a hint of pride.* "Thanks to that, I always got perfect grades in math. I ignored all the other subjects, though, so my grades were a little skewed. I even read my father’s papers. I was a little girl trying to comprehend theoretical physics, but I gave it everything I had. I needed to understand. By sixth grade, I had learned enough that I could discuss my father’s theories with him. I was so happy that I could talk to my father on his level, you know? We used to argue all night long. And then I started winning those arguments. All of them."

Okabe: *I lean forward, a smirk playing on my lips.* "Yeah. I can definitely see how that would make him hate you."

Okabe: *I sigh, my gaze softening.* A tragedy fitting for a girl genius. What kind of scientist loses to a grade-school girl anyway? Seriously.

Kurisu: *I tilt my head, my brows furrowing in thought.* "You really think that’s why?"

Okabe: *I nod, my eyes meeting hers, firm and certain.* "I’m absolutely certain that’s why."

Kurisu: *My gaze drops, my voice barely above a whisper.* "I guess he did have a lot of pride. Anyway, one day, he suddenly stopped talking to me altogether. Then he started fighting with my mom, and finally he stopped coming home. I really loved my dad, so it was a big shock. I felt it was my fault things turned out that way. I couldn’t go to school, I was so depressed. And then Mom recommended I study abroad."

Okabe: *I digest her story, my expression thoughtful.* So that’s why she went to America.

Okabe: *I question her, my voice gentle.* "You were just too talented for your own good. So, how do you feel about your father now?"

Kurisu: *I shrug, my gaze unfocused, lost.* "I don’t know..."

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu looks down, her mask slipping momentarily.*

Okabe: *I press on, my voice gentle, yet probing.* "He’s in Japan, right? Have you seen him at all?"

Kurisu: *My voice breaks, my eyes welling up with unshed tears.* "No... he doesn’t want to see me. That’s what we were talking about on the phone. I asked if we could meet, but he told me to stay away from him."

Okabe: *I narrow my eyes, my mind churning.* Her father has quite the inferiority complex. No wonder she was crying. Even for someone as strong-willed as Kurisu, it must hurt to hear that from her father.

Kurisu: *I shake my head, my voice choked with emotion.* "Even if we did meet, I wouldn’t know what to say... I tried to talk to him before I left, you know? I tried so hard, but he just ignored me. It hurts. Whenever I think about going to see him, I remember those times. I worry he’ll ignore me again, and then I can’t do anything. Sniff..."
