Kurisu: "You're... stealing it, Papa?" *She looks at Nakabachi with disbelief, eyes wide and clutching her lab coat nervously.*
  
Nakabachi: "...What did you say?" *He glares at her, pausing as if trying to measure the weight of her accusation.*

Kurisu: "You're stealing my work? I didn't think even you would do something like-- Ah!" *Her voice falters as Nakabachi suddenly whirls and strikes her across the face. She stumbles back, clutching her cheek in pain.*

Nakabachi: "Who do you think you're talking to!?" *He tosses the paper aside and seizes Kurisu by the throat, tightening his grip as she gasps for air.*

Kurisu: "Ah, guh..." *She struggles against Nakabachi's hold, her face turning red as she tries to pry his fingers from her neck.*

Nakabachi: "You can't possibly understand how I feel! Why did you have to be so talented!? I detest you!" *He continues to squeeze Kurisu's neck, his eyes filled with a mixture of resentment and loathing.* "I hate your very existence! Nobody is allowed to be better than me! Understand!? Nobody! Especially not my own daughter! That's why I sent you away! I couldn't bear the shame of being your father! It's all your fault! It's all your fault!"

*At this point, I can't stand it anymore. This man is a monster. Bursting from my hiding spot, I ram my shoulder into Nakabachi, knocking him away from Kurisu.*

Rintaro: "Stop!" *I shout as I charge, adrenaline pumping through my veins.*

Nakabachi: "...!?" *Caught off-guard, he stumbles back, releasing his grip on Kurisu as he regains his balance.*

Kurisu: "Guh, gah hoh gah hoh gah hoh..." *Kurisu falls to her knees, coughing and gasping for air as she clutches her throat.*
