Okabe: "...Kuh!" *I dodge back instinctively, feeling the cold air where the knife just missed my face. I catch my breath, focusing on saving Kurisu.*

Nakabachi: "Apologize!" *His face twisted in anger, he gathers himself for another strike, clearly not giving up.*

Okabe: "Gh--" *Swallowing my fear, I lunge forward and knock Nakabachi's hand aside. The knife clatters to the floor. I leap on it and pick it up.*

Kurisu: "Stop it, Papa!" *Kurisu steps forward with pleading eyes, trying to reach her father emotionally.*

Nakabachi: "Don't tell me what to do!" *He glares at Kurisu and rummages through a toolbox left in the passage, taking out a screwdriver.*

Okabe: "Run, Kurisu!" *I look at Kurisu, worry filling my eyes, urging her to run away from the scene.*

Kurisu: "This is crazy, Papa! Please stop!" *Ignoring my warning, she continues walking toward her father, defenseless, her voice tinged with desperation.*

Nakabachi: "What do you know? What do you know!?" *His voice reaches a high pitch, eyes blazing with madness.*

Okabe: *I tense, Nakabachi's threat towards Kurisu makes it evident. She's the one in danger. I tighten my grip on the knife.*

Nakabachi: "If only you'd never been born!" *Brandishing his screwdriver, he turns towards Kurisu, his face full of malice.*

Kurisu: "Guh...!" *Kurisu winces and blood spurts from her arm as she uses it to guard her face.*

Okabe: "NAKABACHI!" *Seizing the moment when Nakabachi raises his arm for another blow, I thrust my knife towards his unprotected back.*

Kurisu: "NO!" *Just as my knife pierces flesh, Kurisu forces herself between me and Nakabachi, taking the stab meant for him.*

Okabe: "wh...y..." *My hand trembles on the knife handle, the realization sinking in that I've stabbed Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "Ah... guh...!" *Her strength waning, she slumps against me, her head falling onto my shoulder.*

Nakabachi: "Ha... hahahaha! A fitting end for you fools, hahahaha!" *Laughing maniacally, he grabs his dropped thesis and scurries toward the elevator at the far end of the hallway.*

Okabe: *I stand there, numb and unable to chase him, Kurisu still slumped against me. The weight of what I've done anchors me to the spot.*

Kurisu: "I'm... sorry..." *With her remaining strength, she mutters an apology, her voice barely above a whisper.*
