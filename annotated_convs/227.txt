Kurisu: *I glance at Okabe, my fingers nervously twirling a strand of my hair.* "Um, Okabe? That offer... I can take you up on it, right?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, looking at her in surprise.* "Of course."

Kurisu: *My shoulders relax slightly at his confirmation.* "Then, once we’re done upgrading the PhoneWave... I want you to come with me."

Okabe: *I nod, giving her a curious look.* "As you wish. Where is your father, anyway?"

Kurisu: *I look down, my voice barely a whisper.* "Aomori."

Okabe: *My eyes widen in shock.* "Aomori!?"

Kurisu: *I nod, avoiding his gaze.* "That’s where he lives now."

Okabe: *I take a moment to process the information, my mind racing with thoughts.* That’s way up at the north end of the island, like seven hundred kilometers or something. I wasn’t expecting to have to go that far.

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, giving him a challenging look.* "What? You’re not going to back out, are you? You already promised. I’m taking you whether you like it or not, okay!?"

Okabe: *I swallow hard, meeting her gaze.* "...A-Aomori it is!" *I feel a spark of determination.* If promising to go to Aomori will let Kurisu concentrate on the time leap machine, it’s a small price to pay. A small price indeed.

Okabe: *I notice Mayuri staring blankly at the wall, her hands still on her unfinished costume.* "Mayuri? You’re not going home?" *I wonder why she's staying so late. Her parents might be worried.*

Mayuri: *I look at Okabe, my eyes filled with confusion.* "Um, I was thinking about what Okarin and Chris-chan were talking about earlier. I was trying to figure out what the things you said meant, but it was all so complicated. I didn’t get any of it. Ehehe... The only thing I get is that something amazing is gonna happen!"

Okabe: *I give her an encouraging smile.* "Indeed. The world is about to change, and we shall be the ones to lead humanity into the future."

Mayuri: *I look at him with a soft smile.* "You’re shining, Okarin."

Okabe: *I tilt my head, puzzled.* "Shining? What does that mean?"

Mayuri: *I gaze at him, my eyes full of admiration.* "You’re shining. Chris-chan too. Like two bright stars in the sky."

Okabe: *I chuckle, my chest puffing out with pride.* "That must be my aura of madness you’re sensing. Muhahaha!"

Mayuri: *I fidget with the hem of my dress, my gaze falling to the floor.* "You know, it’s been ten days since Chris-chan joined us. Can I tell you how I’ve been feeling? Since Chris-chan became a lab mem, it feels like things have really started to happen, like we’re a real lab now, you know?"

Okabe: *I nod, appreciating her words.* "Heh. I must admit, her knowledge has been a great asset. Of course, the girl genius would never have joined us if not for the cunning of Hououin Kyouma!"

Mayuri: *I look down, my voice barely a whisper.* "That’s why you’re shining so bright now, Okarin. Chris-chan is really a big help to you, I know... But I can’t do anything to help..."

Okabe: *I notice the sadness in her eyes.* Mayuri looks depressed. *My heart aches for her.* "Mayuri..."

Mayuri: *I look up at him, my eyes filled with longing.* "I wish I were smart too... then maybe I could help."

Okabe: *I sigh, walking over to the window, my gaze lost in the starless sky.* She’s never expressed such sentiments before. Is she jealous of Kurisu’s talents? Is there competition brewing in the lab? "Mayuri. Aren’t you going to look at the stars?"
