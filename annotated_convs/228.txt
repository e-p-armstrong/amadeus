Okabe: *I chuckle, my voice heavy with nostalgia.* "Yeah, it was." *The images of Daru joining the lab in early May flood my mind. How he was initially hesitant until he found out about the lab's convenient proximity to MayQueen+Nyan², and then his enthusiastic acceptance. But before that, for about a month and a half, it was just me and Mayuri, alone in our world of dreams and inventions.*

Mayuri: *She looks up at me, her eyes filled with uncertainty.* "Can Mayushii stay here? Is it really okay?"

Okabe: *I meet her gaze, firm yet comforting.* "Don’t be ridiculous." *Giving her a light bop on the head, I continue.* "All you need to do is stay."

Mayuri: *Her eyes widen, a hint of surprise dancing in them.* "Just... stay?"

Okabe: *I nod, a soft smile playing on my lips.* "Without you, the lab would be a much less friendly place. You see how Kurisu and I argue. We can be pretty stubborn, and sometimes we don’t know when to stop. But when it starts to get out of hand, Mayuri, you’re always there with some ditzy, irrelevant comment to break the tension."

Mayuri: *Her eyebrows furrow in confusion, her voice filled with doubt.* "Um... are you praising me?"

Okabe: *I laugh heartily, the sound echoing in the lab.* "Of course I am. Don’t worry about a thing. Just know that you, too, are part of my plan. Muhahaha!"

Mayuri: *Her face lights up, a beaming smile spreading across her face.* "Okay. Thanks, Okarin♪" *Then, her stomach grumbles, breaking the peaceful silence.*

Mayuri: *She giggles, her cheeks turning a light shade of pink.* "I’m starving! I’ll warm up some canned oden. You want some too?"

Okabe: *I nod, feeling a familiar warmth in my heart.* "Yeah. Heat it up."

Mayuri: *She hops off excitedly to prepare the food.* "Coming right up!" *Soon, we're enjoying the piping hot oden, the comforting aroma filling the lab. The next day, armed with a list penned by Kurisu, Mayuri and I set off for Radi-Kan, shopping for parts for the time leap machine. I have to keep an extra eye on Mayuri, ensuring she doesn't get distracted and wander off.*

Okabe: *I implore, my voice laced with a hint of exasperation.* "I’m begging you, stick with me. If you get lost in this labyrinth of technology, you’ll never escape. Not with your sense of direction."

Mayuri: *She salutes, her voice filled with determination.* "Okey-dokey! I’ll be careful. Um, by the way. How is time leaping different from time travel?"

Okabe: *I sigh, a hint of frustration creeping into my voice.* "Time travel means your whole body travels through time. The time leap will only send your memories to the past. It’s simple."
