Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, my fingers toying with a loose thread on my costume as I grapple with the concept.* "Oh... Does that mean you can do things with time leaps that you can’t do with D-Mails?"

Okabe: *I pause, my eyes narrowing as I contemplate how best to explain.* "D-Mails can only send instructions to the past. The past may change, or it may not. The results are unpredictable, and depend on the recipient. And when the past does change, the worldline is reconfigured. Everyone loses their old memories." *My gaze drops to the floor, my mind filled with the memory of the worldlines I alone can recall.* 

Okabe: *I straighten, my gaze returning to Mayuri as I continue.* "With a time leap, on the other hand, you can give your past self not just instructions, but all of the memories you have right now... or at least, that’s the idea." *I glance towards the unfinished machine, uncertainty gnawing at the edges of my confidence.*

Mayuri: *My eyes light up with a hopeful spark.* "Ummm, so I could send the costume I’m making back to last week? I would love to have another week to prepare for ComiMa."

Okabe: *I shake my head gently, my hands folding together as I try to clarify.* "That might be possible with time travel, but not with time leaping. Say you had a test last week. Now that you know the answers, you could send that knowledge to yourself and ace the test. But you couldn’t go back and hand yourself a cheat sheet."

Mayuri: *I frown slightly, my brows furrowing in thought.* "So Mayushii’s mind goes into Mayushii one week ago?"

Okabe: *I nod, a small smile of approval crossing my face.* "Exactly." *My fingers dance over my phone's screen, the shopping list I've been working through a comforting distraction from the weight of our conversation.*

Mayuri: *My gaze turns distant, my fingers twisting the loose thread tighter.* "You can’t bring stuff, but you can bring your memories... I get it. But, then what about Mayushii one week ago? Where do her memories go?"

Okabe: *I hesitate, my eyes flicking away as I confront the uncertainty of our endeavor.* "I assume they get overwritten."

Mayuri: *My eyes widen, the implications hitting me like a physical blow.* "She disappears?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, my voice steady despite the unease creeping into my heart.* "Your memories right now include your memories from back then. So even if she does disappear, you don’t really lose anything. I guess you could say you’re just adding your memories from one week in the future."

Mayuri: *I bite my lip, my eyes falling to my hands as I grapple with the concept.* "Then, if Mayushii’s memories leap into the Mayushii one week ago, what happens to Mayushii now?"

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by the depth of Mayuri's questioning.* "You become an empty shell... no... that can’t be right. That wouldn’t make sense. My assistant’s device merely records your memory data... in other words, it’s just a backup. Your original memories are still inside you." *I run a hand through my hair, my mind racing as I confront the philosophical complexities of our situation.*

Okabe: *I lean back, my gaze distant as I grapple with the concept.* "Your body shouldn’t become an empty shell, and your consciousness shouldn’t leap, either."

Okabe: *I frown, a new thought striking me.* "Actually, won’t you become a new Mayuri, one who received memories from the future one week ago?"

Mayuri: *I blink, my gaze focusing back on Okabe as I try to wrap my head around the concept.* "Then, does the Mayushii who had the normal memories before the time leap get erased by the Mayushii who repeated the week with extra memories?"
