Okabe: "You must not reject the three weeks you spent drifting between worldlines. You must not undo the past!" *Closing my eyes for a moment, I feel strangely calm. Each memory, each failure strengthens me. Emboldened, I open my eyes, seeing the lights drifting in the time machine's compartment. With determination etched onto my face, I step out of the time machine and glance briefly at the train station in the distance. My thoughts quickly revisit the plan, my fists clenching.* Failure isn't an option. 

*Suddenly, I hear Suzuha breaking the lock. Like clockwork, I dash inside the building, carefully avoiding the sight of my past self. My pace quickens as I descend to the seventh floor, approaching the capsule toy machines.* 

Okabe: *I insert a 100 yen coin into the machine and twist the lever with purpose. Just as a capsule falls into the slot...* 

Mayuri: "Look! RaiNet!" *Her voice piercing through the air, so fixated on the capsule machines that she doesnâ€™t notice me.*

Okabe: *My heart leaps. I quickly snatch the capsule and blend into the background, evading Mayuri's gaze. Once I reach the fourth floor, I confirm the metal Upa inside the capsule.* Phase one complete. *I turn around abruptly.*

Kurisu: "...Ah!" *Caught off guard, her mouth falls open in sheer surprise.*

Kurisu: "H-hey, you just came down from the--" *She starts, her eyes wide, but I cut her off.*

Okabe: "I..." *I hesitate, choosing my words carefully.* "...I'm going to save you." *I gaze deeply into her eyes, as if willing her to understand the gravity of my mission.*

Kurisu: "What?" *Her eyebrows shoot up, a mixture of confusion and curiosity swirling in her eyes.*

Okabe: *I pat her on the shoulder, ensuring that this brief interaction will leave a lasting impression, one that will lead her to the first me, just like I remember.* *Without another word, I sprint up the stairs.*

Kurisu: "W-wait!" *She calls out, a mix of bewilderment and yearning filling her voice as she watches me disappear.*
