Okabe: *I watch as Mayuri finishes signing the Upa, nods to herself, and starts to run towards the stairs. My eyes catch the Upa slipping from her pocket and rolling away, unnoticed by Mayuri.* What are you afraid of, Hououin Kyouma? Everything's going according to plan. Operation Skuld is flawless. You spent fifteen years perfecting it, remember? Believe in yourself. Believe in Hououin Kyouma. *I grip the Cyalume Saber tightly, shaking it to activate the red fluorescent reaction inside. Then, hidden behind a pile of cardboard boxes, I listen for footsteps.*

Kurisu: *Walking up from downstairs, her eyes catch sight of the Upa. She pauses and picks it up, examining it with curiosity.* ... *After looking around to check if anyone might be watching, she tucks the Upa into her envelope.* 

Okabe: *I let out a silent breath from my hiding spot.* It was Kurisu who picked up the Upa... The Butterfly Effect indeed. *My eyes narrow.* She doesn't even know Mayuri at this point. *I shift my gaze towards the eighth floor and make my move to the employee hallway, waiting for the next set of footsteps.*

Kurisu: *Reaching the eighth floor, she leans against the wall and takes another glance into her envelope, her lips curling into a soft smile.* 

Okabe: *Hearing applause from the event hall, my heart starts pounding. My gaze turns piercing.* That smile doesn't suit you, Kurisu. *I stifle a chuckle, wondering how I can be so calm at a moment like this.*

Kurisu: *Hearing footsteps, she straightens up, her posture stiffening. She takes a deep breath, preparing herself for what's about to come.* ...I wanted to talk. Are you listening, Papa? *Her voice barely above a whisper, laden with a mixture of hope and tension.*

Okabe: *Hearing her say "Papa," I know it's Nakabachi. I grip the stun gun in my pocket, ready to spring into action at any moment. My fingers twitch, just waiting for that bastard to make his move.* One mistake, and Kurisu will die. *The weight of the statement hangs heavy in the air as I brace myself.*
