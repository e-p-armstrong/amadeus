Okabe: *I listen to Mayuri's musings about the time leap, an amused smirk playing on my lips.* "You want to go back to your elementary school days? Heh heh heh, I know exactly how you feel. If you repeat elementary school with the knowledge you have now, you’ll get top grades and have an easy time bending children to your will."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, considering his words, my eyes glazing over slightly as I delve into my memories.* "Yeah, and I thought maybe I could see Grandma again."

Okabe: *I pause, the weight of her words settling heavy in my chest. A somber look crosses my face as I recall the time when Mayuri lost her grandmother.* "...I see. I’m afraid that’s not possible."

Mayuri: *I nod, a small, melancholic smile tugging at my lips.* "Yeah... It’s too bad, but I guess I don’t really need to see her. I still remember her words, her smile, and her wrinkly hand patting my head. So even if I don’t see her again, I’m okay. What I really want is to see little Okarin again! Ehehe!"

Okabe: *I chuckle, the sound echoing around us, a wave of nostalgia washing over me.* "Heh. Back then, I was already a scientist without equal, a titan towering above the other children. You can hardly be blamed for desiring to meet the child prodigy who would one day be feared as the great mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma."

Mayuri: *I scrunch up my nose, shaking my head at his dramatics.* "I don’t want to meet Hououin Whatshisface. I want to meet Okarin!"

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, choosing to ignore her comment, my mind already spinning with plans and theories.* "Anyway, there’s no point. You haven’t matured at all since that time, so nothing would change if you went back to elementary school anyway."

Mayuri: *I puff my cheeks, crossing my arms in a huff.* "Hey! That’s not true. Mayushii’s all grown up now."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, teasingly poking at her.* "The only thing that’s grown is how much you eat." *I glance at her, my eyes betraying a hint of amusement.* And your breast size.

Mayuri: *I pout, shaking my head fervently.* "That’s not true! Mayushii’s a real woman now."

Okabe: *I chuckle under my breath, unable to help but find her adorable.* A real woman? I kind of want to hear the details, but she probably doesn’t know what she’s talking about.

Mayuri: *I stick my tongue out at him, giggling.* "Besides, I think Okarin’s the one who hasn’t changed since then."

Okabe: *I throw my head back, my laughter filling the air.* "Isn’t that what I said? I was already a genius mad scientist when you met me! MUHAHAHA!"

Okabe: *I notice the shopkeeper's glare and I quickly stifle my laughter. It's time to wrap things up here. We pay for our purchases and step out into the bustling streets, the cool air hitting our faces.* "By the way, Mayuri. Have you not been working recently?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my brows furrowing in confusion.* "Working? You mean at Lemoine?"

Okabe: *I nod, the memory of MayQueen+Nyan² — a place that no longer exists in this world — bringing a strange sense of nostalgia.* "Um, ComiMa’s coming up, so I’m taking a few days off. I’ve got costumes to make!"

Okabe: *My lips curl into a small smile, her dedication never ceasing to amaze me.* "How many costumes are you making this year?"

Mayuri: *I start counting on my fingers, a determined gleam in my eyes.* "Three. One for Kaede-chan, one for Fubuki-chan, and then there’s one for Luka-chan."
