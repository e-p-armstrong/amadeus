Kurisu: "I heard you were giving a presentation on time travel. So I thought about it too. Could it be possible to make a time machine?" *She adjusts her glasses nervously, glancing toward her father, awaiting his response.*

Okabe: *I grip the Cyalume Saber in my hiding spot, worried that Nakabachi might explode any moment. I realize something's off.* "...!?" *I closely inspect the Cyalume Saber, shocked to find the fake blood beginning to coagulate.* "No. This shouldn't happen."

Nakabachi: *His face tightens in anger.* "I wasn't shunned!" *He snaps, his voice turning shrill.*

Okabe: *Nakabachi's sudden outburst startles me, pulling me back to reality.*

Nakabachi: "Those incompetent bastards were just jealous of my superiority. I was the one who gave up on them!" *He clenches his fists in indignation.*

Kurisu: "Please don't yell..." *She says softly, eyes lowered.*

Okabe: *I start to panic as I realize that my window for intervention is closing.* "How do I recover from this setback? What do I do!? Do I go back to the time machine and try again? No. This is my last chance!" *I whisper to myself.*

Kurisu: "Um... we haven't seen each other in a while. There's a lot I want to talk about. You're living in Aomori now, right?" *She attempts to steer the conversation towards a more personal topic.*

Nakabachi: "Leave." *He interrupts, his voice stern.*

Kurisu: "Eh..." *She looks visibly stunned.*

Nakabachi: "Go back to America. Never show your face to me again." *He spits out the words, fueled by disdain.*

Kurisu: "But--" *She tries to speak, only to be interrupted.*

Nakabachi: "You want my opinion!? We'll submit it jointly!? You don't mean any of that! I know how you think!" *He points a finger accusingly at Kurisu.*

Okabe: *My heart pounds as I realize the situation is spiraling out of control. I cover my mouth to suppress the sound of my heavy breathing. Events are proceeding just like last time.*

Nakabachi: "Is this pity!? How dare you!? You're supposed to be my daughter!" *His eyes narrow menacingly at Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "I... I don't understand. Please calm--" *She attempts to reason with him.*

Nakabachi: "I am calm! Don't tell me what to do!" *He cuts her off, red-faced with rage.*

Nakabachi: "I'll tell you why I called you here today. I wanted to show you my research, research beyond even what you can imagine! I wanted to prove, once and for all, that you are nothing compared to me! But that brat in the lab coat ruined everything!" *He growls, throwing his hands up in frustration.* "How dare you treat your own father this way!?"

Kurisu: "I wasn't--" *She tries to interject but gets cut off again.*

Nakabachi: "You want my opinion? Fine, I'll give it to you. I'm going to publish it myself. End of discussion." *He turns away from Kurisu, as if having the final word.*

Okabe: *Thinking from my hiding spot, my resolve hardens. I can't depend on anyone else.* "I won't court the mercy of a heartless god. She won't die again. Not at my hands."

Kurisu: "You're... stealing it?" *She finally catches her breath, a mix of disbelief and anger in her eyes.*

Nakabachi: "...What did you say?" *He turns back to her, his eyes narrowing.*

Kurisu: "You're stealing my work? I didn't think even you would do something like-- Ah!" *She takes a step back, horrified at what is transpiring.*
