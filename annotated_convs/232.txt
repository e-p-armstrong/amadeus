Okabe: *I squint at the figure Mayuri is pointing at.* "What?" *The tired figure of Moeka, squatting by the staircase and staring intently at her phone, comes into focus. Her exhaustion is palpable, making me hesitate before breaking the silence.* 

Okabe: *Ignoring my reservations, I call out to her with a forced cheerfulness.* "Hey, Finger! Why the long face, eh?"

Mayuri: *I wave at Moeka, my voice chiming in the air.* "Tutturu♪ Moeka-san. What are you doing here?"

Okabe: *The lack of response from Moeka is disconcerting, but I press on, adopting a tone of exaggerated bravado.* "Hey, are you listening? If you have a problem, the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, will gladly assist! But be warned. By the time I’m through, Akiba will be an ocean of blood... heh heh heh."

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat as Moeka suddenly jerks upright, her eyes wide in surprise.* "What is it? What’s wrong?" *I watch as she starts typing furiously on her phone, preparing myself for her message.*

Okabe: *My brows furrow in confusion.* "What do you mean, what happened? We don’t fully understand it yet. We’re in the middle of upgrading it."

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes sparkling with excitement.* "It’s amazing! This time, we might even be able to time leap."

Okabe: *I hold up a warning finger to Moeka.* "Don’t write anything about it. Otherwise we’ll have to expel you from the lab."

Okabe: *I relax slightly as Moeka shakes her head vigorously.* "Our hacking of SERN has uncovered a new possibility for the PhoneWave (name subject to change). It’s a form of time travel made possible by borrowing SERN’s equipment. This discovery will begin a new age of human civilization. No longer will men be slaves to time. Any future you desire can be yours! And history will record that we, the Future Gadget Laboratory, changed the world forever!"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, a puzzled expression on my face.* "Um, Okarin, that was really confusing. You lost Mayushii."

Okabe: *I wince as Moeka digs her fingernails into my arm.* "U-unhand me!" *But she does not let go.*

Okabe: *With a dramatic flair, I pull away from Moeka, clutching my arm.* "The time leap is a way to send your memories to the past! We found a way to make that possible. Soon we will complete the machine and become the undisputed lords of time!"

Mayuri: *I beam at Okabe, my voice filled with admiration.* "Um, Okarin came up with the idea and Chris-chan told us how to do it. Daru-kun’s helping, and Mayushii and Okarin are shopping♪"
