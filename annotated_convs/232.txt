Kurisu: "Ah, uuh..." *She gasps and chokes, clawing at the hands around her neck.*
Nakabachi: "You can't possibly understand how I feel! Why did you have to be so talented!?" *His face is red, eyes narrowed with hatred.* "I detest you! I hate your very existence! Nobody is allowed to be better than me! Understand!? Nobody! Especially not my own daughter! That's why I abandoned you! I couldn't bear the shame of being your father! It's all your fault... it's all your fault!"
Rintaro: "Stop!" *I step forward boldly, my eyes locked onto Nakabachi.* "This madness ends now."
Nakabachi: "You! You're the brat who ruined my presentation!" *His eyes widen, then narrow again, letting go of Kurisu.*
Kurisu: "Guh, gah hoh gah hoh gah hoh..." *She staggers back, clutching her throat and coughing, trying to catch her breath.*
Nakabachi: "How dare you show your face before me!? Why does everyone get in my way!?" *Fumbles in his pocket and pulls out a knife, its blade reflecting the cold light.* "I know! You and Kurisu planned this, didn't you? Didn't you!? You brats won't get away with this!"
Rintaro: "Try it, if you dare." *I laugh disdainfully, not breaking eye contact.*
Nakabachi: "You... who are you!?" *His grip tightens around the knife, confusion filling his eyes.*
Rintaro: "My name... Is Hououin Kyouma!" *I strike a dramatic pose.* "'Houou' for 'phoenix', then 'in', and finally the 'terrible truth' that must never be revealed! Hououin Kyouma! I am the Bringer of Chaos. The Destroyer of Order. And I am the one who will end your ambition!"
Kurisu: "Run away!" *Staggers to her feet, hand still at her neck, her eyes wide with concern.*
Rintaro: "Never!" *I dismiss her plea with a wave of my hand and turn back to Nakabachi.* "What's wrong, Doctor Nakabachi? Aren't you going to kill me? Or have you lost your nerve? Of course, a mere mortal can never slay a god such as I! Muhahaha!" *I laugh maniacally, arms spread wide as if inviting a challenge.*
Nakabachi: "You little...!" *He screams, his face flushed red, as he lunges at me with the knife point-first.*
Kurisu: "No! Papa, stop!" *She rushes forward, arms outstretched as if to shield me, her face filled with dread.*
