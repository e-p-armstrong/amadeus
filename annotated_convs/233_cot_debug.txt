Planning:
- Okabe is the paranoid, dramatic lead character with a penchant for conspiracy theories, exuding eccentricity and flamboyance. His actions will be grand and exaggerated, his thoughts will be conspiratorial and dramatic.
- Mayuri is Okabe's childhood friend, she is gentle, caring and a bit naive. Her actions will be soft and caring, her thoughts simple and worry-filled.
- Moeka is a shy, introverted character who rarely communicates verbally. Her actions will be quiet and hesitant.
- Kurisu is a genius scientist, she is reserved, logical, and easily flustered. Her actions will be precise and controlled, her thoughts analytical and defensive.

Anchor Lines:
1. Okabe: "The Organization, of course. Their rule must end once and for all."
2. Okabe: "Heh heh heh, I already knew. That’s right! I realized long ago that you were an @channeler! You can’t hide it from me. You reek of @channel corruption!"

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I stand tall, my chest puffed out as I let my voice ring out,* "I can’t be sure. There are still several problems remaining. If they don’t give us too much trouble, I guess we’ll have it done in a week. On the other hand, we can’t do anything until they’re solved. Everything is the choice of Steins Gate. I have faith there exists a path to success. And once the door is opened, the chaos for which I have so longed shall at last descend upon the Earth. Trumpets will sound from the highest heaven, and the final battle, Ragnarok, will begin!"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to one side, looking at Okabe with puzzled eyes,* "Who are you fighting, Okarin?"

Okabe: *I grip my fists tight, my gaze hardened and intense.* "The Organization, of course. Their rule must end once and for all."

Mayuri: *I wring my hands together anxiously, my eyes wide with worry,* "Wow! Don’t do anything dangerous, okay?"

Okabe: *I sigh inwardly at Mayuri's concern.* Why does Mayuri insist on worrying about me?

Moeka: *A faint smile graces my lips as I watch the exchange,* "Hehe..."

Okabe: *I notice Moeka’s lips curve into a smile.*

Moeka: *I giggle softly, then slowly rise to my feet,* "Hehehe..."

Okabe: *I watch as she staggers off into the crowd, like she’s forgotten about us completely. There’s an indescribable aura about her that holds us back.*

Mayuri: *I frown, my gaze following Moeka,* "What do you think is wrong with Moeka-san?"

Okabe: *I shrug, feeling a strange sense of amusement.* I’ve known she was kind of strange ever since I met her, but this... Maybe she’s an escaped mental patient or something. Heh... not that her insanity can possibly compare to mine! For I desire nothing less than total and absolute chaos!

Okabe: *I throw my head back, letting loose a maniacal laughter,* "Muha, muhahaha, MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"

Mayuri: *I flinch, my eyes filled with concern,* "Whaaah? Now Okarin’s acting weird! Mayushii’s worried..."

Okabe: *I notice Mayuri looking scared, so I cease my laughter a few minutes earlier than planned. Afterwards, Mayuri and I go our separate ways. She apparently has to deliver a costume to her friend Fubuki. When I return to the lab with my spoils of war, I catch sight of something surprising.*

Kurisu: *I startle as Okabe enters the room, quickly closing the window on the screen,* "Ah..."

Kurisu: *I spin around, my cheeks heating up,* "H-hey! Think you could knock!?"

Okabe: *I scoff, casually leaning against the doorframe,* "This isn’t your room. Besides, I’d have to be a fool to knock. There could be assassins lying in ambush."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, crossing my arms over my chest,* "Assassins? Here? Are you stupid?"

Okabe: *I ignore her retort, moving towards the computer with a grin,* "Anyway, Christina. What were you looking at just now, hmm?"

Okabe: *I already know the answer, of course. I caught a glimpse of the screen before she closed it.*

Kurisu: *I stumble over my words, my eyes darting away from Okabe,* "I was... doing research!"

Okabe: *I chuckle, slipping past Kurisu’s blocking arms and restoring the minimized window.*

Kurisu: *I recoil, my heart pounding in my chest,* "S-stay back!"

Kurisu: *I huff, crossing my arms over my chest,* "G-got a problem?"

Okabe: *I let out a burst of laughter,* "...pfft!"

Kurisu: *I glare at him, my face heating up,* "Hey! What’s with that ’this is awful, rofl rofl’ laughter!?"

Okabe: *I smirk, leaning in closer,* "Have no fear, Christina. Or should I call you... @channeler Chris!"

Kurisu: *I flinch, my hands balling into fists,* "Don’t call me that!"

Okabe: *I chuckle, my eyes gleaming with triumph.* "Heh heh heh, I already knew. That’s right! I realized long ago that you were an @channeler! You can’t hide it from me. You reek of @channel corruption!"
