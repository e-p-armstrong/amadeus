Okabe: *I wander aimlessly through the streets, pondering the intricacies of the Steins Gate worldline.* "I don't know what the future will bring. There's still the possibility that Daru won't get married -- that Suzuha won't be born." *I pause, contemplating the world I've come to exist in.* "But still, I believe. That in seven years, we will meet again. And that's when I will give her this pin, her birthright as Lab Mem 008." *I pat the pocket where I've safely stowed the pin. I take out my phone and pull up a news feed.* "Have there been any murders at Radi-Kan?" *I mutter to myself as I skim headlines, eventually stumbling upon a video clip of Nakabachi's manic outburst.*

Nakabachi: *He gesticulates wildly on my phone's screen, his eyes bloodshot.* "This is an outrage! An outrage!! A fire!? How can that happen!? My precious thesis was burned to a crisp! The future of humanity went up in flames!" *He appears to be yelling at an off-screen entity.* "This is no time for an interview! I won't stand for this, Russian Airlines! I'll murder every last one of your crew members! Money's not the issue! Aren't you listening!? You burned my thesis! My thesis, which would have changed human history forever! I should never have let you fools handle my suitcase!"

Okabe: *I shake my head, locking my phone and putting it back into my pocket.* "He'll get nowhere with that kind of behavior. At least not as long as Kurisu is alive to counter him."

Female Reporter: *I recall her composed demeanor as she appeared on my phone's screen.* "This outburst continued for some time. Doctor Nakabachi, also known as Makise Shouichi, was detained by Russian authorities upon arrival at Domodedovo International Airport in Moscow."

Okabe: *I pause, lost in thought.* "Kurisu reported that I was stabbed... but for some reason, she hasn't made any other move to contact me. Even though we are strangers in this worldline." *I contemplate the complex threads of fate that have led to this moment.* "But she's alive. That's enough for me." *I reach into my pocket and take out a pin, clipping it to my chest as I walk through the crowd.* "Hey, Kurisu. I don't know what the future holds. War may still break out. SERN may still complete their time machine. But the future is undecided. So keep on watching, wherever in this wide world you may be."

Okabe: *I suddenly halt, my eyes catching a glimpse of something, or someone, familiar.* "...eh?" *I quickly turn around, scanning the sea of shoppers.* "There she is. Could it be...?"

Kurisu: *She seems to sense my gaze, pausing in the middle of the sidewalk before slowly turning around.* "It's you!"
