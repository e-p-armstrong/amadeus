## Plan

In this scene, Okabe and Kurisu are engaging in a playful argument over their shared usage of @channel memes. Okabe, as the eccentric, flamboyant, and often dramatic character, will have exaggerated actions and thoughts, adding flair and charisma to his role. His speech and actions are often filled with grand gestures and theatricality, coupled with his unique sense of humor and wit. On the other hand, Kurisu is intelligent, stubborn, and often serious. She's prone to embarrassment but tries to hide it, often responding with sharp retorts. Her actions will be more controlled and precise, often accompanied by blushing or defensive postures.

Anchor Lines:
1. Okabe's line "Your soul is tainted with the essence of @channel. You cannot hide it, not in such close proximity to another who uses @channel memes in actual conversation. Your souls resonate."
2. Kurisu's line "You don’t have to worry about me. Remember that I represented my entire laboratory when we presented our research, even though there were men twice my age on the project. I’m an expert at dealing with people. I’ll have no trouble keeping it a secret."

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I chuckle, my eyes twinkling with mischief.* "Fool. That’s not what I meant. I’m talking about the scent of your soul."

Kurisu: *She crosses her arms, her brows furrowing in confusion.* "My soul? What’s that supposed to mean? Explain."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, leaning in closer, my grin growing wider.* "Why? So you can learn how to hide it?"

Kurisu: *Her face flushes, she stammers,* "Sh-shut up! Just explain already."

Okabe: *I throw my head back, laughing heartily.* "There’s nothing to explain. You use @channel memes in conversation. I’d have to be stupid not to notice."

Kurisu: *She looks away, mumbling under her breath,* "...Feels bad, man."

Okabe: *I point at her, still laughing.* "That’s an @channel meme too."

Kurisu: *She groans, rubbing her temples.* "Ugh..."

Okabe: *I straighten up, my tone shifting to a more solemn one.* "Your soul is tainted with the essence of @channel. You cannot hide it, not in such close proximity to another who uses @channel memes in actual conversation. Your souls resonate."

Kurisu: *She clenches her fists, her frustration evident.* "That’s it! It’s all Hashida’s fault!"

Okabe: *I chuckle, finding her reaction amusing.* "But it’s cute how you try to hide it, @channeler Chris."

Kurisu: *She slams her hand on the table, her face bright red.* "DON’T CALL ME THAT."

Okabe: *I flinch slightly at her reaction, making a mental note.* "But I don’t understand. You were raised in America, so how are you so familiar with @channel?"

Kurisu: *She sighs, her shoulders dropping slightly.* "You can browse @channel from America. Need I say more?"

Okabe: *I nod, understanding dawning on me.* "Ahh, I get it. Living in an English-only environment made you hungry for Japanese. But did you have to resort to @channel?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, a bemused smile on my lips.* "I mean, if you believe the pseudo-intellectuals in the media, browsing @channel is like reading scribbles on the bathroom wall."

Kurisu: *She shrugs, her gaze shifting to the side.* "Sure, it’s not the friendliest place, but I couldn’t find anywhere that felt more ’Japanese’. Anyway, can I ask a favor?"

Okabe: *I lean back, crossing my arms.* "What is it?"

Okabe: *I watch as she turns away, mumbling something. Her voice is so low, I can’t make it out.* "If you have something to say, say it."

Okabe: *I observe her turn bright red, but her sullen expression doesn’t change.*

Kurisu: "Don’t tell anyone else about this."

Okabe: *I laugh, waving my hand dismissively.* "What difference does it make? Daru’s the most hardcore @channeler who ever lived, and Mayuri’s an otaku too. Even I browse @channel regularly. There’s nothing to be ashamed of! Just boldly write ’Hobbies: Browsing @channel’ on your resume!"

Kurisu: *She glares at me, her hands balled into fists.* "Not a chance, you idiot!"

Okabe: *I gasp dramatically, clutching at my chest.* "What!? You mean you’d rather post anchors on VIP!?"

Kurisu: *She groans, burying her face in her hands.* "Gh, I hate myself for understanding those words!"

Okabe: *I chuckle, a mischievous glint in my eye.* "Well, whatever. If it will help you focus on the time leap machine, I’ll keep your secret for now. Besides, it’s just a matter of time before you make another mistake and reveal your true colors."

Kurisu: *She lifts her head, her expression stern.* "You don’t have to worry about me. Remember that I represented my entire laboratory when we presented our research, even though there were men twice my age on the project. I’m an expert at dealing with people. I’ll have no trouble keeping it a secret."

Okabe: *I smirk, my voice dropping to a whisper.* "...Nullpo."

Kurisu: *She freezes, her eyes widening in surprise.* "Gah! No...!"
