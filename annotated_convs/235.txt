Kurisu: "I've been looking everywhere for you! Ever since you saved my life. I was afraid I'd never have a chance to say thank you. I'm so glad we could finally meet. Thank you. Thank you so much. And thank goodness you're alright." *Kurisu looks at me with eyes shining, as if she's fighting back tears. Her face is the picture of relief and gratitude.*

Okabe: *I feel overwhelmed, flooded with emotions I thought I'd suppressed. To hide my embarrassment, I take out my phone and bring it to my ear.* "It's me. Why is she here? Reading Steiner didn't activate. What? Protect her!? Heh... that's a tall order, my friend. But if that is the choice of Steins Gate... then so be it. El Psy Kongroo." *I snap my phone shut and clear my throat, searching for the right words.*

Kurisu: *She's still staring at me with those wide, pleading eyes, and I finally speak.* "We meet again, Christina."

Kurisu: "How many times do I have to tell you!?" *Her eyes narrow, and her voice raises a notch.* "I'm not Christina, or your assistant or--"

Okabe: "...!?" *My eyes widen, puzzled.* 

Kurisu: "Eh?" *She looks equally bewildered, as if questioning herself.*

Okabe: *My mind races. How could she know about those names? They were our inside jokes.* "Now I really have no idea what to say."

Kurisu: "Huh? I... why did I say that? Words just..." *Her face scrunches in confusion, as if she's pondering a difficult question.* "popped into my head..."
