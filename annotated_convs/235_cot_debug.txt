Plan:
- The characters involved in this scene are Okabe, Mayuri, and Kurisu. 
- Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist and a bit of a chuunibyou. He's often extravagant and dramatic in his speech and actions, so his *actions* and *thoughts* will reflect this. He'll have a playful, exaggerated tone.
- Mayuri is a sweet and gentle character. She's always positive and a bit naive. Her *actions* will be simple and innocent, reflecting her pure nature. 
- Kurisu is a serious and intelligent character, often the voice of reason against Okabe's outrageous statements. Her *actions* will be more restrained and thoughtful, reflecting her scientific mind.
- The anchor lines for this scene will be Okabe's statement about his "stimulation system" and Kurisu's response about toxic waste. These lines will be written in a way that reflects Okabe's flamboyant, over-the-top nature and Kurisu's dry, sarcastic wit. 

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I glance over at Mayuri, her hands skillfully guiding fabric through the sewing machine. She's been tirelessly working on her costume since she returned earlier this evening.* "Mayuri, go home before it gets too late. Your parents will worry."

Mayuri: *I look up, giving him a reassuring smile.* "It’s okay. I’m gonna stay the night."

Okabe: *Taken aback, I stutter,* "...R-really?" *The idea of Mayuri spending the night at the lab is new to me.*

Mayuri: *Nodding, I return to my work.* "Yup. I already told Mom and Dad."

Okabe: "Are you staying to work on your costume?" *I ask, trying to understand her sudden change in routine.*

Mayuri: *I giggle, a twinkle in my eye as I imagine the finished product.* "It won’t be done in time for ComiMa if I don’t. Ehehe!"

Okabe: "I’m surprised your parents let you stay." *I muse aloud, considering Mayuri's normally protective parents.*

Mayuri: *I shrug, the needle continuing to hum as I work.* "They trust you, Okarin."

Okabe: *I run a hand through my hair, a mischievous grin spreading across my face.* "It must be my overwhelming charisma... No, wait, that makes me sound like a good person, so that can’t be it... Of course! Mayuri’s parents are so afraid of my insanity that they sent me their only daughter as a hostage!"

Kurisu: *From the other room, I call out, my voice laced with dry humor.* "Reported."

Okabe: *I throw my head back and laugh, the sound echoing off the lab's walls.* "What would you do if I called the cops on you?"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, returning to my work on the PhoneWave.* "I unleash my right arm on traitors, Christina."

Okabe: *I smirk, my voice dripping with mock threat.* "Yeah, yeah, chuunibyou, whatever."

Mayuri: *I look between them, a bit confused.* "Um, I told Mom and Dad that Chris-chan would be here. Then they said okay."

Kurisu: *I pause, my eyebrows furrowing as I process this new information.* "Wait, so I have to stay too?"

Mayuri: *I nod enthusiastically.* "Yup♪ Don’t you have to work on the PhoneWave?"

Kurisu: *I sigh, shaking my head slightly.* "I guess... but I don’t relish the thought of spending the night here. At least, not with a certain somebody around."

Okabe: *I spread my arms, gesturing around the lab with a grandiose flourish.* "Environment matters, Christina. This is a place of science and research, so you should have no trouble concentrating on your work. Trust the great Hououin Kyouma. Also, it may surprise you to learn that I have equipped this lab with a system that stimulates brain function. So if you were wondering where my incredible genius comes from, now you know! It’s because I sleep in this room every night!"

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, skepticism etched into every line of my face.* "This stimulation system of yours... I assume it’s been dumping toxic waste in your brain?"

Okabe: *I chuckle, waving off her comment.* "You sound like an environmentalist, Zombie."

Mayuri: *I perk up, suddenly remembering something.* "Ah, Mayushii knows! You’re talking about that, right?"

Kurisu: *I step out of the development room, following Mayuri's pointed finger.* "This... air freshener?"

Mayuri: "Okarin said the smell makes you smarter. He bought it at Akiba-o. When was that?" *I ask, turning to Okabe with a curious tilt of my head.*

Okabe: *I shrug, a sheepish grin on my face.* "...About six months ago. It was on sale for 500 yen."

Kurisu: *I shake the air freshener, hearing the hollow sound of an empty can.* "I’m starting to think even you don’t believe the stuff you say. And besides, this air freshener is empty."
