Kurisu: *With a shrug of indifference, I toss my hair over my shoulder, a spark of defiance in my eyes.* "Well, whatever. I was planning to stay either way. I’ll join you, Mayuri-san."

Mayuri: *I bounce on my heels, a bright smile spreading across my face.* "Really? That’s great!"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, and my gaze hardens as I turn to Okabe.* "On one condition. Okabe leaves."

Okabe: *I put my hands on my hips, my expression a blend of disbelief and indignation.* "Me, leave? I practically live here! This lab was promised to me by Steins Gate. It’s the dwelling place of my soul!"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes at his dramatic response, but my tone is firm.* "We girls are staying here overnight, so you filthy boys need to show respect. Your home isn’t even far from here, right?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, chiming in with a helpful tone.* "Okarin lives close to Mayushii, in Ikebukuro."

Kurisu: *I nod at Mayuri's words, adding more weight to my argument.* "Why, that’s less than 30 minutes by train. Anyway, I’m not going to need your help tonight, so just go home like a good boy, okay?"

Okabe: *I cross my arms over my chest, standing my ground.* "But I refuse."

Kurisu: *I gasp, my eyes widening in shock and indignation.* "What? Are you planning to molest us!?"

Okabe: *I scowl at her accusation, my tone heated.* "Shut up, Mongolian Spot!"

Kurisu: *I sputter in disbelief, my cheeks flaming with embarrassment.* "I don’t have a Mongolian Spot! And when did you see my butt, anyway!?"

Okabe: *I ignore her outburst, my gaze softening as I think of their safety.* "I can’t leave two young girls here alone! Minors need guardians!"

Mayuri: *I giggle at his words, my tone light and teasing.* "But Okarin’s a minor too!"

Okabe: *I puff out my chest, my voice resolute.* "I’ll be 20 in less than a year and a half. In other words, Steins Gate has decided that I am an adult."

Kurisu: *I smirk at his claim, my tone dripping with sarcasm.* "I’m pretty sure that makes you a minor just like us."

Mayuri: *I look between the two of them, my voice earnest.* "Um, Chris-chan? I don’t think Okarin would do anything bad. I mean, we’ve been together for more than ten years, and he hasn’t molested me once."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow at her words, my tone incredulous.* "But he took you hostage, didn’t he?"

Mayuri: *I nod enthusiastically, my voice cheerful.* "Yup♪ Actually, I’m still his hostage."

Kurisu: *I sigh, shaking my head in disbelief.* "We should kick him out of the room."

Okabe: *I let out a deep sigh, pressing a hand to my forehead.* "Haa... You disappoint me, Christina. This lab is a place of science. We are above such petty concerns as sex. If you must speak of these vulgarities, then I’ll have to ask you and your Mongolian Spot to leave!"

Okabe: *As Kurisu returns to the development room, I can't help but smirk at her retreating figure.* "Ah. So Christina really does have a birthmark on her bu--"

Kurisu: *I whip around, my face redder than ever as I shout at him.* "NO!"
