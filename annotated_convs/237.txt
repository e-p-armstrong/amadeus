Kurisu: *I shriek, twisting my body awkwardly in a desperate attempt to shield myself from Okabe's gaze.* "Kyaaa! What are you doing!?"

Mayuri: *I quickly crouch down, wrapping my arms around myself protectively.* "Hyah! No peeking, Okabe!"

Okabe: *I stagger back, my heart pounding in my chest as I force a shaky laugh.* "Phew. You’re still alive." *I wipe the cold sweat off my brow and let out a deep, shaky sigh.* "Don’t scare me like that. What are you guys doing packed into that tiny shower anyway?"

Kurisu: *I shoot Okabe a deadly glare, my face burning with a mix of embarrassment and anger.* "Get out, you perv!"

Okabe: "Whoa!" *I yelp, barely managing to dodge a bar of soap aimed at my face. As the soap clatters to the floor, I hastily retreat from the dressing room.* "Well... I suppose that was all my fault."

Mayuri: *I wrap my arms around myself, my eyes welling up with tears.* "Mayushii’s sad... I feel kinda dirty...."

Kurisu: *I grit my teeth, my voice shaking with rage as I yell after Okabe.* "You’re gonna regret this! I’ll never forgive you!"

Okabe: *I slump against the wall outside the shower room, my heart still racing. I let out a sigh, shaking my head.* "Dammit. It was just a small misunderstanding." *I bring my phone to my ear, my voice taking on a dramatic tone.* "It’s me. We have a problem. I’m under attack from the Mongolian Spot and Ditzy sisters. They’re going directly after my sanity, a bold move against the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma. This is the strongest offensive I’ve encountered so far. I realize now that vulnerability itself can be a powerful weapon. They’re pulling out all the stops, and I don’t think my pants can take it. Give in to the temptation? Nonsense. I could never do that. They’re fellow lab members, my loyal assistant and my childhood friend. ...Must I? Is it truly the will of Steins Gate that I give in? That I raise my hand against my closest companions? If so... then how cruel the fates be! El... Psy... Kongroo!"
