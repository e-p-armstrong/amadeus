Kurisu: *I brush a lock of hair behind my ear, my eyes focused on the diagrams spread across the table.* "For the final adjustments, we need to use the PhoneWave."

Okabe: *I groan, rubbing my temples.* It's not the technical aspect that's troubling me. It's the risk involved. A risk called Mister Braun. The discharge phenomenon causes the entire building to shake. Last time, Mister Braun threatened to raise our rent if it happened again. *I glance at Kurisu and Daru, my eyebrows furrowed in concern.*

Itaru: *I shrug, a smirk tugging at the corner of my mouth.* "It’s up to you, Okarin."

Kurisu: *I offer him a nod, my gaze unwavering.* "Take care of it."

Okabe: *I chuckle dryly, running a hand through my hair.* "In other words, you’re sending me to die."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, my tone matter-of-fact.* "Your sacrifice will allow us to complete the time leap machine."

Itaru: "Besides, you’re always the one who talks to the boss for us."

Okabe: *I point a finger at them, a dramatic flair in my voice.* "Well maybe it’s time for you to put your lives on the line."

Kurisu: *I avert my gaze, a slight blush dusting my cheeks.* "I can’t. That girl who works there hates me."

Okabe: *I sigh, resigning myself to the task.* "...Fine. But hear this. I will not die! Like the immortal phoenix, I will return, no matter how many times it takes!"

Mayuri: *I look up from my costume, my eyes wide and hopeful.* "Don’t die. Okay?"

Okabe: *I offer her a reassuring smile as I head down to handle things with Mister Braun. As I step into the store, I find Mister Braun, Suzuha, and the chipmunk -- Nae -- watching some comedy show on the massive 42-inch CRT. Business as usual at the Braun Tube Workshop.*

Suzuha: *I greet him with a casual nod.* "’Sup, Okabe Rintaro."

Okabe: *I raise my hand in response to Suzuha’s greeting, my gaze shifting to the chipmunk who quickly hides behind her father when she sees me.* "I see you’re as busy as ever."

Tennouji: *I narrow my eyes at Okabe, my tone stern.* "Okabe! Buy a CRT."

Okabe: *I look around the store, my eyes narrowing in thought. Could our lifter be a CRT?* "No thanks. I’m not some kind of retro TV otaku. I’d rather buy an LCD."

Tennouji: *I raise an eyebrow, my curiosity piqued.* "You’ve been having a lotta girls over lately, haven’t ya?"

Okabe: *I shrug nonchalantly.* "Just the usual members."

Suzuha: *I join in the conversation, a playful smirk on my face.* "I was over the other day."

Tennouji: *I chuckle, trying to play it cool.* "Invite me next time, huh? I wanna talk to some young girls for a change."

Nae: *I hide behind my father, my voice barely a whisper.* "Daddy, that’s dirty."

Tennouji: *I stumble over my words, flustered.* "N-no it isn’t! It’s, uh... marketing! Yeah, I’m looking for new customers!"

Okabe: *I can't help but laugh at this scary-looking guy trying desperately to explain himself to his daughter.*

Suzuha: *I raise an eyebrow, a teasing tone in my voice.* "What do you mean, for a change? You talk to me every day."
