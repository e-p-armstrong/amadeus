Planning/Brainstorming:

Okabe Rintaro: He is the protagonist, a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He tends to act in a very flamboyant, eccentric manner, often referring to himself in the third person as 'Hououin Kyouma'. His actions and thoughts will reflect this eccentricity. He also cares deeply about his friends. 

Suzuha Amane: She's a straightforward, no-nonsense character with a mysterious background. She often seems older than her years, and there's an undercurrent of tension between her and Makise Kurisu. Her actions will reflect her straightforwardness, and her dialogue will be direct and to the point.

Nae Tennouji: She is a kind, gentle girl who is somewhat afraid of Okabe. Her actions will reflect her shy, timid nature.

Yuugo Tennouji: He is Nae's father, a gruff man with a hidden tender side. His dialogue and actions will reflect his gruff exterior, but his affection for his daughter will be evident.

The anchor lines would be Suzuha's line, "Okabe Rintaro... we’re the same age, but sometimes you seem a lot older. You really know how to give people strength." and Okabe's response to that, "Heh, of course. I am the great Hououin Kyouma!" These lines reveal a lot about their characters and the respect they have for each other. 

Roleplay:

Suzuha: *I turn to Okabe, my eyebrows slightly raised.* "Did you say something, Okabe Rintaro?"

Okabe: *I shrug nonchalantly, a slight smirk on my face.* "Only the truth."

Tennouji: *I kneel down to meet Nae's eyes, my voice softening.* "Nae, your father is happy as long as he has you. Okay?"

Nae: *I nod, my eyes shining with innocent trust.* "Yup. I know. But don’t say dirty things anymore, ’kay?"

Tennouji: *I chuckle, my eyes crinkling at the corners.* "It’s a promise!" *I extend my pinky finger to her, and we link ours in a solemn vow.* 

Okabe: *I watch their interaction, my mind whirling with thoughts.* How does a guy like Tennouji produce a daughter like that? Nae is one of the kindest, gentlest girls I’ve ever met. How can I explain to them about the imminent building shake without getting my head ripped off?

Suzuha: "Hey, did Shiina Mayuri stay over yesterday?"

Okabe: *I nod, my gaze drifting to the stairs leading to the upper floor.* "Yeah."

Suzuha: *Her eyes narrow slightly, a hint of tension in her voice.* "So... Makise Kurisu stayed too?"

Okabe: *I glance back at her, my eyebrows raising slightly at her tone.* "Yeah. They’re both upstairs."

Suzuha: *I sigh softly, my gaze dropping to the floor.* "Oh..."

Okabe: *My mind races as I watch her reaction.* Suzuha’s hostility towards Kurisu hasn’t abated. *I decide to change the topic.* "And how are you doing?"

Suzuha: *I blink, taken aback by the sudden question.* "Huh?"

Okabe: *I lean back, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Are you feeling better?"

Suzuha: *I give him a small nod, a determined look in my eyes.* "Oh. Yeah, I guess. The search continues."

Tennouji: *I look at Suzuha, my eyebrows knitted in confusion.* "Huh? What’s this about, part-timer?"

Suzuha: *I turn to Tennouji, my hands clenching into fists.* "I’m searching for my dad. I told you before, remember?"

Tennouji: *I scratch my head, a sheepish smile on my face.* "Oh, right. Go find her old man, Okabe."

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, my arms crossed over my chest.* Why does he think he can boss me around? *But, I keep my tone light.* "Hmph, naturally. Suzuha’s a fellow lab member. Leave it to us."

Suzuha: *Her face lights up, a warm smile spreading across her face.* "Okabe Rintaro... we’re the same age, but sometimes you seem a lot older. You really know how to give people strength."

Okabe: *I feel a warmth spread through me at her words.* That’s the first time anyone’s said that to me. *I puff out my chest, a triumphant grin on my face.* "Heh, of course. I am the great Hououin Kyouma!"

Tennouji: *I glare at Okabe, my voice low and threatening.* "Okabe. Next time you scare Nae, I’ll kill ya."

Okabe: *I flinch, my eyes widening in surprise.* "S-sorry..."

Suzuha: *I reach out, gently taking Okabe's arm.* "Come here a sec." *I lead him away from the Tennoujis, who have gone back to watching TV.*

Suzuha: *I look into Okabe's eyes, my voice serious.* "I just want to say... Be circumspect in your dealings with Makise Kurisu."

Okabe: *I blink at her, my mind racing.* "What?" Circumspect? Why can’t she just say careful like a normal person?

Okabe: *I frown, my arms crossed over my chest.* "This again? Aren’t you just being paranoid?"

Suzuha: *I shake my head, my gaze unwavering.* "No. Her perniciousness has been proven."
