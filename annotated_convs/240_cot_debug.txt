Plan:
Okabe: The protagonist, a self-proclaimed mad scientist who is paranoid about the “Organization” and SERN. He is flamboyant, dramatic and, often talks about his “magic eye”. He will be written as paranoid and dramatic, with a tendency to overreact.
Suzuha: She is a time traveler from the future and is serious, determined, and has a sense of urgency. She will be written as concise and direct, with a firm and no-nonsense tone.
Tennouji: He is Okabe's landlord, an impatient and hot-tempered man who is easily irritated. He will be written as gruff and short-tempered.
Nae: Tennouji’s young daughter who is innocent and shy. She will be written with timidity and a sense of innocence.
Anchors: Suzuha's revelation about Kurisu being connected to SERN and Tennouji's confrontation with Okabe.

Roleplay:
Suzuha: *I stare at Okabe, my eyes hard as steel, and my voice as cold as the winter wind.* "Listen to me. She’s using you all. Makise Kurisu is connected to SERN."

Okabe: *I gasp, a cold shiver running down my spine.* "What!?" *My mind races, thoughts tumbling over each other in a desperate scramble for comprehension.* 

Suzuha: *I hold Okabe’s gaze, my expression unwavering.* "You’re saying she’s a spy?" *I ask, my voice barely a whisper.*

Suzuha: *I nod firmly, my eyes never leaving Okabe's.* "The credit for inventing the time machine was hers."

Suzuha: *I take a step back, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Don’t let your guard down."

Okabe: *I shake my head, unable to believe what I'm hearing. I remember Kurisu's outrage, her passionate denouncement of SERN.* Could she be the one who sent that threatening email? I suspected Moeka, but...

Nae: *I let out a small squeak, my eyes wide with fear.* "Kyah..."

Okabe: *I stumble, my heart pounding as the ground shakes beneath my feet.* "Damn, it’s too soon!" *I shout, panic creeping into my voice.*

Tennouji: *I storm out of my shop, my face red with anger.* "OKABE!"

Okabe: *I flinch at the sound of Tennouji's booming voice, seeing the veins on his forehead swell in response to the shaking.* 

Tennouji: *I jab a finger at Okabe, my voice echoing off the walls.* "How many times do I have tell you not to shake the building!? Cute girls or no, I ain’t letting you off. Your rent’s going up!"

Okabe: *I raise my hands in a placating gesture, my voice frantic.* "Wait, Mister Braun! This isn’t our doing! It’s an earthquake! My magic eye, Reading Steiner, predicted this would happen!"
