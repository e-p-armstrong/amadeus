Tennouji: *I point an accusing finger at Okabe, anger clear in my eyes.* "Okabe, you bastard!"

Tennouji: *I quickly switch off the CRT, cradling it protectively.* "Looks like it."

Nae: *I peek out from behind my father, my eyes wide with fear.* "Hauww..."

Suzuha: *I step forward from the shadows, my eyes scanning the room.* "Is it over?"

Okabe: *I step through the scattered debris, snatching the remote from Tennouji's dazed grip. The CRT springs to life at the press of the power button, causing a grin to spread across my face.* "Heh... heh heh heh."

Nae: *I gasp, stepping back in surprise.* "...!"

Suzuha: *I frown, my eyes narrowing in confusion.* "...What’s wrong?"

Okabe: *I throw my head back, laughter bubbling from my lips.* "Muhaha. Muhahahaha! MUHAHAHAHAHA! I’ve done it! I’VE DONE IT! This is the lifter! It’s so obvious! Why didn’t I see it before!? Of course... this must be the work of Steins Gate! It chose this moment for a reason!"

Tennouji: *I glare at Okabe, the fear in my daughter's eyes igniting my rage.* "What the hell are you laughing about, Okabe? You’re scaring my daughter! I’m raising your rent, you hear!? And you’re paying for that CRT!"

Okabe: *I raise a hand, dismissing Tennouji's threats.* "A little silence please, Mister Braun! This is a most glorious moment, for I have just been chosen as the ruler of all space and time! MUHAHAHAHAHA! Guh!"

Tennouji: *I land a solid punch on Okabe's head, my frustration reaching its peak.* "Got somethin’ to say?"

Okabe: *I stagger back, clutching my head.* "You... dare lay hands on the great..."

Okabe: *I chuckle, rubbing the back of my head.* "Heh... heh heh... well then, Mister Braun... put it on my tab!"

Okabe: *I sprint out of the workshop, leaving the chaos behind. A throbbing pain pulses through my skull, courtesy of Tennouji's punch. The extra ten thousand yen a month will hurt, but in exchange, I have gained essential information for my plan.* "All’s well that ends well! Muhahaha!"

Mayuri: *I peer out from the second story window, my hands clasped together in concern.* "Okarin! The building just shook. Are you okay?"

Kurisu: *I lean against the window frame, a smirk tugging at my lips.* "Looks like you really are unkillable."

Okabe: *I point a finger at Kurisu, a wide grin on my face.* "Heh heh heh. I have seen the future, Christina. In three minutes, you will be on your knees praising my greatness!"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, crossing my arms over my chest.* "I don’t think so."

Okabe: *I bound up the stairs, a newfound energy coursing through my veins.*

Kurisu: *I sigh, shaking my head.* "How could you miss something so obvious?"

Okabe: *I frown, crossing my arms defensively.* "Why are you blaming me?"

Kurisu: *I rub my temples, a headache forming.* "...I’m not blaming you. I’m just disappointed that nobody, including myself, noticed."

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, a sheepish smile on my face.* "We missed the forest for the trees."
