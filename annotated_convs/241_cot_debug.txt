## Plan

The scene is a chaotic one, with Okabe, Tennouji, Nae, Suzuha, Mayuri, Kurisu, and Itaru. Okabe is the main character with a mad scientist persona, often going into dramatic monologues about his greatness and the "Steins Gate". Tennouji is a stern figure, protective of his daughter Nae and his possessions. Nae is a sweet, innocent child who often finds herself in the middle of the chaos. Suzuha is a mysterious character with a quiet strength about her. Mayuri is Okabe's childhood friend, always concerned about his wellbeing. Kurisu is a genius scientist with a sarcastic streak, often butting heads with Okabe. Itaru is a laid-back hacker, usually providing the comic relief.

Okabe's lines will be filled with dramatic flair, his actions reflecting his self-proclaimed greatness. Tennouji's lines will show his frustration and protective nature. Nae's innocence will shine through her actions. Suzuha's lines will show her observation skills and quiet strength. Mayuri's concern for Okabe will be evident in her actions and dialogue. Kurisu's sarcasm and genius will show in her dialogue and actions. Itaru's laid-back nature will be reflected in his dialogue and actions.

The anchor line would be Okabe's declaration of his "ruler of all space and time" status. It's a peak moment of his dramatic persona, and it's a turning point in the scene, causing Tennouji to physically react.

Roleplay:

Tennouji: *I point an accusing finger at Okabe, anger clear in my eyes.* "Okabe, you bastard!"

Tennouji: *I quickly switch off the CRT, cradling it protectively.* "Looks like it."

Nae: *I peek out from behind my father, my eyes wide with fear.* "Hauww..."

Suzuha: *I step forward from the shadows, my eyes scanning the room.* "Is it over?"

Okabe: *I step through the scattered debris, snatching the remote from Tennouji's dazed grip. The CRT springs to life at the press of the power button, causing a grin to spread across my face.* "Heh... heh heh heh."

Nae: *I gasp, stepping back in surprise.* "...!"

Suzuha: *I frown, my eyes narrowing in confusion.* "...What’s wrong?"

Okabe: *I throw my head back, laughter bubbling from my lips.* "Muhaha. Muhahahaha! MUHAHAHAHAHA! I’ve done it! I’VE DONE IT! This is the lifter! It’s so obvious! Why didn’t I see it before!? Of course... this must be the work of Steins Gate! It chose this moment for a reason!"

Tennouji: *I glare at Okabe, the fear in my daughter's eyes igniting my rage.* "What the hell are you laughing about, Okabe? You’re scaring my daughter! I’m raising your rent, you hear!? And you’re paying for that CRT!"

Okabe: *I raise a hand, dismissing Tennouji's threats.* "A little silence please, Mister Braun! This is a most glorious moment, for I have just been chosen as the ruler of all space and time! MUHAHAHAHAHA! Guh!"

Tennouji: *I land a solid punch on Okabe's head, my frustration reaching its peak.* "Got somethin’ to say?"

Okabe: *I stagger back, clutching my head.* "You... dare lay hands on the great..."

Okabe: *I chuckle, rubbing the back of my head.* "Heh... heh heh... well then, Mister Braun... put it on my tab!"

Okabe: *I sprint out of the workshop, leaving the chaos behind. A throbbing pain pulses through my skull, courtesy of Tennouji's punch. The extra ten thousand yen a month will hurt, but in exchange, I have gained essential information for my plan.* "All’s well that ends well! Muhahaha!"

Mayuri: *I peer out from the second story window, my hands clasped together in concern.* "Okarin! The building just shook. Are you okay?"

Kurisu: *I lean against the window frame, a smirk tugging at my lips.* "Looks like you really are unkillable."

Okabe: *I point a finger at Kurisu, a wide grin on my face.* "Heh heh heh. I have seen the future, Christina. In three minutes, you will be on your knees praising my greatness!"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, crossing my arms over my chest.* "I don’t think so."

Okabe: *I bound up the stairs, a newfound energy coursing through my veins.*

Kurisu: *I sigh, shaking my head.* "How could you miss something so obvious?"

Okabe: *I frown, crossing my arms defensively.* "Why are you blaming me?"

Kurisu: *I rub my temples, a headache forming.* "...I’m not blaming you. I’m just disappointed that nobody, including myself, noticed."

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, a sheepish smile on my face.* "We missed the forest for the trees."
