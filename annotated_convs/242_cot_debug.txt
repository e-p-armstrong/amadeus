Plan: 

The characters involved in this scene are Kurisu, Mayuri, Itaru, and Okabe. Kurisu is a brilliant scientist with a serious and focused demeanor. Mayuri is a cheerful and naive character. Itaru is an intelligent otaku, while Okabe is the eccentric, dramatic protagonist.

For Kurisu, I'll use precise, analytical language with a touch of impatience. Mayuri's *actions* will be gentle and caring, reflecting her kind nature. Itaru's *actions* will be more laid back, and for Okabe, I'll incorporate his grandiose and theatrical language into his *actions* and *thoughts*. 

The first anchor line will be Kurisu's line: "Somehow, the conditions here were perfect to create a time machine. Frankly, it’s a miracle." I will enhance this line to highlight the wonder and disbelief of the situation. 

The second anchor line will be Okabe's line: "No, Christina! Not a miracle! This is the choice of Steins Gate!" I will emphasize Okabe's defiance and conviction in this line.

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I furrow my brows, staring at the screen with a mix of frustration and determination.* "The discharge was interrupted. I put a banana in just to be sure. Nothing happened."

Mayuri: *I let out a soft sigh of relief, my fingers absentmindedly smoothing out the fabric of my costume.* "I’m glad. We shouldn’t waste food."

Kurisu: *Ignoring Mayuri's off-point statement, I continue our research, typing at a rapid pace as we delve into the intricacies of cathode ray tubes.* "We’ve found the answer. The electrons emitted by the 42-inch CRT are holding the PhoneWave’s black hole open. And the discharge phenomenon is the result."

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, stroking my chin thoughtfully.* "So the reason we can’t use the PhoneWave at night is because the Braun Tube Workshop’s closed?"

Okabe: *I nod slowly, realizing the correlation between the workshop's operating hours and the PhoneWave's functionality.* "But how can a cathode ray tube emit such a strong electron stream?"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, correcting Okabe's misconception.* "It’s not about having a strong electron stream. If stronger were better, SERN would’ve solved the lifter problem long ago."

Kurisu: *I pause, looking around at the makeshift lab around us. It's nothing more than a cluttered room, yet somehow, it's become the birthplace of a time machine.* "Somehow, the conditions here were perfect to create a time machine. Frankly, it’s a miracle."

Okabe: *I step forward, my voice echoing with defiance and conviction.* "No, Christina! Not a miracle! This is the choice of Steins Gate!"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, a hint of a smile playing on my lips despite Okabe's dramatics.* "Whatever it is, it worked."

Mayuri: *I look up from my costume, a puzzled expression on my face.* "Umm... So, um, what do we have to do to complete Super PhoneWave-chan?"

Kurisu: *I glance at the PhoneWave, my mind already plotting the next steps.* "Now that we’ve found the cause, there’s nothing left to hold us back. We can safely conclude that time leaping is possible when, and only when, that television is on."

Itaru: *I rub my hands together, excitement sparking in my eyes.* "We should probably test it, right? And there’s still the final check of the PhoneWave to do."

Kurisu: *I nod, my gaze landing on Okabe.* "You’re right. Okabe."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a hint of suspicion creeping into my voice.* "What?"

Kurisu: *I point towards the door, a stern look on my face.* "Go downstairs and turn that TV back on."

Okabe: *I throw my head back in laughter, my voice dripping with sarcasm.* "Ha. Ha. Ha. That’s hilarious, Christina. Allow me to dub that... Mission: Impossible!"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, my patience wearing thin.* "Whatever. Just go already."

Kurisu: *I soften my tone, trying to encourage Okabe.* "If anyone can do it, it’s you. You made an amazing discovery just now, didn’t you?"
