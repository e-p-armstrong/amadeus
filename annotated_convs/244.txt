Suzuha: *I stand tall, my gaze steady.* "I’m not much of a warrior if I can’t handle that. Besides, you said you’d help me search for my father, right?" *I clench my fist, determination seeping through my voice.* "I’m only returning the favor."

Okabe: *I nod, acknowledging her resolve.* "I see. Then I leave it in your capable hands."

Suzuha: *With a playful grin, I salute him.* "Okey-dokey!"

Nae: *I tug at Suzuha's sleeve, my innocent eyes filled with worry.* "Suzuha? Don’t be mean to Daddy, okay?"

Suzuha: *I crouch down to Nae's level, a warm smile on my face.* "Ahaha! Don’t worry. I won’t be mean."

Okabe: *I chuckle lightly, patting Nae's head.* "Indeed." *The thought of accusing Tennouji of being the mean one crosses my mind, but I keep it to myself.*

Suzuha: *Turning to Nae, I pat her head reassuringly.* "Wait here, Nae."

As we enter the store, I observe Mister Braun cleaning up the broken pieces of the CRT. Our eyes meet, and I see a vein pop on his forehead.

Tennouji: *I point at Okabe, a stern look on my face.* "If you came to apologize, I’ll listen. But your rent’s going up, understand?"

Okabe: *I swallow hard, putting on my best diplomatic smile.* "I’m sorry about what happened. I overreacted. As a token of apology, my lab’s representative, Amane Suzuha, would like to present you with a gift."

Suzuha: *I take a deep breath, trying to suppress my nervousness.* "Boss... get ready!" *With a dramatic shout, I whip off my jacket and--*

Suzuha: *I throw my jacket into Mister Braun’s face with all my might.* "Yaah!"

The sight of Suzuha in her tight tank top catches me off guard. However, Suzuha doesn't seem bothered by it as she rushes Mister Braun, slipping behind him and pulling her coat tight against his face.

Suzuha: *With a determined look, I call out to Okabe.* "Okabe Rintaro, now’s your chance!"

Is this really her idea of seduction? It looks more like she's trying to suffocate him!

Suzuha: *I strain against Mister Braun's attempts to shake me off.* "Hurry!"

Mister Braun is struggling, flailing his arms to escape Suzuha's restraint. He's stronger, and I know it's only a matter of time before he shakes Suzuha off.

Okabe: "W-well done, Warrior! Your heroism will be remembered!" *With Suzuha keeping Tennouji distracted, I seize the opportunity to grab the remote and switch on the CRT. The image appears on the screen and the ceiling starts shaking. Kurisu activated the PhoneWave (name subject to change) with perfect timing.*

Tennouji: *I try to shout, but Suzuha's coat muffles my voice.* "Mmm, mmmmmhmh! Mhmhmhmhmhhmh! MhmhhmhmhmmhmhmhhhhmmhmhmHmhm!"

Suzuha: *I glance back at Okabe, confusion evident in my eyes.* "It’s shaking again, Okabe Rintaro. What’s going on?"

Did she really not know why she had to distract Tennouji?

Okabe: *With a sigh of relief, I praise Suzuha.* "You’re a lifesaver, Part-Time Warrior! If you can, keep him restrained for ten more seconds!"
