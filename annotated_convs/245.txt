Mayuri: *I suddenly jolt up, my hands hitting the air with a flourish.* "Fwapp!"

Itaru: *I chuckle, mimicking her action.* "I got a fwapp!"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, barely concealing a smile.* "Stop it already, perv."

Okabe: *I follow Mayuri’s directions, spreading the costume out by the sleeves, the fabric rustling under my touch.*

Mayuri: *I step back, my eyes studying the costume critically.* "Hmm..."

Okabe: *I watch as she inspects it, her focus unwavering. Her usual air of ditziness is replaced by a deep seriousness that always surprises me. I can't help but admire her dedication, her passion for her craft. I'm holding Lukako's custom-made costume in my hands, and even though I remember Lukako's initial resistance, I'm not surprised that Mayuri managed to persuade her.*

Mayuri: *She finally nods, a satisfied smile replacing her serious expression.* "Okay. Thanks!"

Okabe: *I can't help but notice the fatigue in her eyes. She's been working tirelessly, pouring her heart and soul into this costume. And yet, her satisfaction shines through, undimmed by her exhaustion.*

Mayuri: *She claps her hands together, a triumphant smile on her face.* "Finished♪"

Okabe: "It’s done?"

Mayuri: *She nods, her eyes sparkling with excitement.* "Yup. I finished before Chris-chan. We were racing."

Kurisu: *She smiles, her tone warm and sisterly.* "You win, Mayuri. Congratulations."

Okabe: *I can't help but feel a pang of jealousy. She treats Daru and me like garbage, yet she shows this soft, sisterly side to Mayuri.*

Kurisu: *She turns back to her work, her hands moving deftly as she connects the two cords.* "Actually, I’m just about finished too."

Okabe: *I watch as she finalizes her work, expecting a sense of accomplishment, of celebration. But instead, I feel a chill of apprehension creeping in. The machine is complete, yet the room is silent.*

Mayuri: *She breaks the silence, her voice barely a whisper.* "It’s a tie..."

Itaru: *He sighs, slumping back in his chair.* "Man, I’m tired... I want Faris-tan to comfort me..."

Okabe: *I glance around the room, taking in the weary faces of my friends. We've worked non-stop for three days, and the exhaustion is evident. But it's not just physical fatigue. The completion of the time leap machine has brought with it a chilling realization. A question we hadn't dared to ask before: What do we do with it? I turn my gaze to Kurisu, finding my own turmoil mirrored in her eyes.*

Kurisu: *She voices our collective fear, her voice barely above a whisper.* "We may have created a monster here..."

Okabe: *I look at the improved PhoneWave, the headgear attached to the X68000. It looks out of place, like something from a low-budget cyberpunk movie. It's a stark reminder of what we've accomplished, of the power we now hold. We don't need nerve jacks or brain chips for it to work. We just need to put it on and let the sensors do the rest.*

Okabe: *I try to lighten the mood, injecting some of my usual dramatic flair into my voice.* "Why don’t we decide what to call it first? I vote Heavenly Express!"

Itaru: *He chuckles, offering his own suggestion.* "PhoneWave 3rd Edition ver1. 00."

Mayuri: *She giggles, her voice playful.* "Silly Hat PhoneWave-chan."

Okabe: *I glance around the room, realizing that we're not going to reach a consensus anytime soon.*

Kurisu: *She sighs, shaking her head.* "You guys have too much free time."

Okabe: "Does that mean you’re abstaining from the vote?"

Kurisu: *She pauses for a moment, then speaks.* "...Time Leap Machine."

Itaru: *He wrinkles his nose, his tone teasing.* "That’s terrible."

Kurisu: *She stammers, trying to defend her choice.* "C-come on! Simple is best, right? I mean, that’s what Okabe’s been calling it for the past two days."

Okabe: "Looks like my assistant has zero naming sense."

Kurisu: *She glares at me, her voice sharp.* "I don’t want to hear that from a chuunibyou headcase like you."

Itaru: *He chuckles, looking at Kurisu with a teasing smile.* "Oh-ho! So Makise-shi knows the word chuunibyou... I sense your otaku level is quite high."

Kurisu: *She blushes, quickly looking away.* "I... heard it from a friend. I have no idea where it comes from!"
