Planning:

Characters: 
- Itaru: A computer nerd and otaku who is Okabe's right-hand man in Future Gadget Laboratory. He's often sarcastic and perverted.
- Okabe: The protagonist, who often acts grandiose and eccentric, but is also deeply caring and responsible.
- Kurisu: A genius neuroscientist who is serious, rational, and somewhat socially awkward.
- Mayuri: A sweet, innocent, and sometimes naive girl who is Okabe's childhood friend.

Styles/Actions:
- Itaru: His actions will involve a lot of slouching, eye-rolling, and dismissive gestures.
- Okabe: His actions will be grand, dramatic, and show his internal struggle between his dramatic persona and his genuine feelings.
- Kurisu: Her actions will be calculated, professional, but with small signs of vulnerability and passion for her work.
- Mayuri: Her actions will be simple, innocent, and often oblivious.

Anchor Lines:
- Okabe: "I want to experiment."
- Kurisu: "It’s too much for us to handle, that’s for sure. The safest thing would be to hand it over to the government for professional research."

Roleplay:

Itaru: *I shrug, leaning back in my chair with a dismissive wave of my hand.* "So I was a boring little bastard who did nothing but study, what of it?"

Okabe: *I lean forward, placing my elbows on the table and intertwining my fingers.* "Basically, that little bastard would suddenly have all your perverted memories, but his personality wouldn’t change. It’s not like you’ll become that famous anime detective with ’the looks of a child and the brains of an adult’."

Itaru: *I snort, crossing my arms over my chest.* "What? That sucks."

Kurisu: *I clear my throat, my fingers nervously playing with the edge of my lab coat.* "Ahem. Um, since you need a phone to receive the signal, you can only send memories to the times you had one. We also need to make sure that the sender and recipient are the same person. If someone besides your past self -- your parents, or a friend, for instance -- answers the phone, then the nerve impulse signals will be projected into their brain instead. If that happens, your memories could overwrite theirs, which could obviously cause serious damage to their psyche."

Okabe: *As Kurisu finishes her explanation, the room falls into silence. I exchange glances with Itaru and Kurisu, and when my gaze lands on Mayuri, I find her expression blank. It's clear she didn't understand. I clear my throat, preparing to ask the question hanging in the air.* "So, what do we do with it?"

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, tilting my head in confusion.* "Do with what?"

Okabe: *I sigh, rolling my eyes at Itaru's feigned ignorance.* "The Time Leap Machine, of course. What do we do with it?"

Kurisu: *Kurisu is silent for a moment, her lips pressed into a thin line. She looks down, her fingers fidgeting with her lab coat again.* "It’s too much for us to handle, that’s for sure. The safest thing would be to hand it over to the government for professional research."

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, a distant look in my eyes.* "It just doesn’t feel real."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my eyes wide with confusion.* "Mayushii doesn’t get it..."

Itaru: *I snicker, shaking my head at Mayuri's innocence.* "That’s ’cause you didn’t work on it, Mayu-shi."

Mayuri: *I giggle, my eyes twinkling with amusement.* "Oh, right. Ehehe!"

Kurisu: *Kurisu's gaze lands on me, her expression serious.* "What about you, Okabe? And I mean you, not Hououin Kyouma."

Okabe: *I pause, my gaze drifting to the Time Leap Machine. My fingers drum on the table as I weigh my options.* "I want to experiment," *I finally say, my voice firm despite the uncertainty in my heart.*

Okabe: *As the words leave my lips, I feel the weight of their implications. This is uncharted territory, for us and for humanity.* "But there are still questions we need to answer... Who will time leap?"

Kurisu: *Kurisu's gaze meets mine, her expression unreadable.* "...It’s hard to choose."

Itaru: *I quickly avert my gaze, shaking my head.* "I’ll pass."

Mayuri: *I blink, clearly lost.* "...?"
