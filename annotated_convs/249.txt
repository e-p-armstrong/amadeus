Okabe: *I rub my chin thoughtfully, my eyes narrowing as I delve deep into the labyrinth of my thoughts.* "What if there’s an error somewhere, and the data itself gets fractalized? Let’s say I send my memories an hour into the past. My memories would be replaced by fractalized data. In other words, data full of tiny holes. Couldn’t that cause memory loss?"

Kurisu: *I pause, my fingers tapping lightly on the table as I consider his words.* "...I suppose."

Okabe: *I lean forward, my hands spread wide, as if trying to visualize the timeline in the air.* "One hour later, we arrive once again at the present. At that time, the me who lost his memories an hour ago and the current me conflict in my brain. Which data set survives?"

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, my gaze thoughtful, my voice steady.* "...Logically, the present should change as soon as you send your memories to the past."

Okabe: *I nod, a smirk playing on my lips, my eyes gleaming with a mix of fascination and uncertainty.* "So then it’s not a copy-paste at all, is it?"

Kurisu: *I shrug, my expression unreadable.* "I don’t know. No one’s ever experienced time travel before."

Okabe: *I raise a finger, a triumphant grin on my face.* "When we send a D-Mail, the world is reconstructed based on the change we made to the past." *I can't help but feel a pang of melancholy, as I am the only one who's aware of this.*

Kurisu: *She leans back, her eyes distant, contemplating the infinite possibilities.* "We don’t know what happens when you time leap. If it’s the many-worlds interpretation like Titor said, then the instant you time leap, it creates two possibilities -- one where you shift to another worldline, and one where you travel back in time on the same worldline. Of course, there must also be a worldline where the current you doesn’t disappear. That would likely correspond to the present that we are experiencing right now."

Mayuri: *She tilts her head, a puzzled expression on her face.* "???"

Okabe: *I chuckle, a soft, almost bitter sound.* "I thought you didn’t believe what Titor had to say."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms defensively, my tone slightly impatient.* "I’m talking hypothetically. Titor doesn’t matter right now. If it’s the Copenhagen interpretation, then every possible state propagates through space as a wave function. When a particular state is observed, the remaining states collapse and that state is fixed."

Okabe: *I lean back, my gaze focused on the ceiling, lost in thought.* "The problem is who the observer is in this case."

Itaru: *I chime in, my tone casual, as if we were discussing the weather.* "Wouldn’t it be a third party? Like me, or Mayu-shi."

Mayuri: *I blink, looking between them, my confusion deepening.* "...?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, my gaze intense.* "Not necessarily. It might be me. It might be someone else. It could even be God."

Kurisu: *She sighs, rubbing her temples, the weight of our discussion evident in her tone.* "This Time Leap Machine only sends memories. That, I guarantee."

Itaru: *I shrug, my tone nonchalant.* "Won’t the present be reconstructed at the moment of transfer? That’s what happens with Okarin’s Reading Steiner, right?"

Okabe: *I nod, my fingers tapping rhythmically on the table.* "That makes sense where D-Mails are concerned. When we send a D-Mail, we’re obviously interfering in past events. But time leaping is different. All you do is send your memories to the past, which isn’t the same thing as sending a targeted D-Mail. Whether the me who suddenly ’remembers’ one hour into the future will, in fact, change the past is something we can’t know until it happens."
