Planning: 
- Kurisu: She's rational, intelligent and sometimes sarcastic. Her *actions* will reflect her scientific mind and her *thoughts* will often be analytical and logical. 
- Okabe: He's eccentric, emotional, and prone to dramatics. His *actions* will be a bit exaggerated and his *thoughts* will often be filled with emotion or dramatic flair.
- Mayuri: She's innocent, sweet and often a bit clueless. Her *actions* will be filled with a child-like innocence and her *thoughts* will be simple, yet profound in their own way. 

The anchor lines will be Kurisu's line about the uncertainty of the experiment and Okabe's decision to not experiment and entrust the Time Leap Machine to a suitable research institution. The thematic direction will be about the fear of the unknown and the decision to take the safer route. 

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I raise my hand, gesturing for them to halt their wild assumptions.* "Wait. You guys are misunderstanding something. One hour isn’t enough time for your personality to change. You should be the same person one hour ago that you are now. The only difference is that you’ll have an extra hour’s worth of memories."

Okabe: *I frown, crossing my arms over my chest, my mind whirling with doubts.* "How can you be sure?"

Kurisu: *I sigh, running a hand through my hair in frustration.* "Well, I can’t... Nobody’s tried it before." *My words hang heavily in the room, a stark reminder of the unknown territory we're treading.*

Okabe: *The conversation seems to be going in circles, and I can't help but feel a growing unease. The concepts of personality and consciousness are abstract and undefinable, making it hard to predict the outcome.*

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my eyes filled with confusion.* "So, which is it?"

Kurisu: *I throw my hands up, a look of resignation on my face.* "We don’t know. We can argue the theories all we want, but in the end, we can only guess. This experiment may end up shattering preconceptions scientists and philosophers have held for centuries." *My voice is filled with a mixture of excitement and dread, the gravity of our experiment sinking in.*

Okabe: *I lean back, running my fingers through my hair as I try to process everything. The thought of experimenting with someone's psyche is a terrifying prospect. The silence in the room is deafening, and I can't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. The Time Leap Machine is a groundbreaking invention that could change the world.*

Mayuri: *I timidly raise my hand, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Hey..."

Okabe: *Turning my attention to Mayuri, I notice her eyes are glazed, as if she's been deep in thought.*

Mayuri: *I nervously chew on my lower lip, hesitant to voice my thoughts.* "Um, I have an idea... Why don’t we make a banana time leap instead?"

Kurisu: *I can't help but chuckle at Mayuri's innocent suggestion.* "Oh Mayuri... Bananas don’t have brains like people do."

Mayuri: *I nod, a look of understanding crossing my face.* "Oh... you need a brain, huh..."

Okabe: *Mayuri's innocent question lightens the tense atmosphere, and I can't help but smile. It's comforting to know that some things never change.*

Okabe: *With newfound resolve, I stand up, my voice firm and unwavering.* "Let’s not experiment. We’ll entrust the Time Leap Machine to a suitable research institution. Then we’ll announce it to the world." *I feel a sense of relief wash over me as neither Kurisu nor Daru object.*

Okabe: *I cast a wary glance at the Time Leap Machine, as if it could suck up my memories any moment. Despite its allure, the fear of the unknown is too great. I make a mental note to organize a celebration for the completion of the device.*

Okabe: *After a shopping trip with Kurisu, we walk along the evening streets. I can't help but notice Kurisu stealing glances at me, and I feel a twinge of curiosity.*

Okabe: *I decide to voice my observations, my voice laced with a hint of concern.* "Are you upset?"

Kurisu: *Caught off guard, I blink, my eyes wide with surprise.* "Upset?"
