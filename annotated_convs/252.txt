Okabe: *A heavy sigh escapes my throat as I look around the Braun Tube Workshop. The 42-inch CRT is switched off, and the silence of the room is almost comforting.* "Daru, why did you order the exact same pizza as before!?" *I question, opening the pizza boxes to find the exact same ones he got for Suzuha’s party.*

Itaru: *I shrug nonchalantly, a smirk playing on my lips.* "Because I like it."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, obviously not amused.* 

Mayuri: *I hop over to Okabe, tugging at his sleeve gently.* "Okarin, Okarin. I called Feris-chan and Luka-chan, but they said they couldn’t come."

Okabe: *I blink at her, my mind shifting from the pizza disappointment.* "Oh. Do they have plans?"

Mayuri: *I nod, recounting their responses.* "Feris-chan has a RaiNet tournament."

Itaru: *My eyes widen, and I smack my forehead in regret.* "Crap, I should’ve gone to cheer! How careless of me!"

Mayuri: *I giggle at Itaru's reaction, then continue,* "And Luka-chan seemed embarrassed for some reason."

Kurisu: *I chime in, a teasing smile on my lips.* "Maybe she thinks you’ll make her wear a costume again."

Okabe: *I turn to Kurisu, my eyes narrowed in thought.* "You still haven’t convinced her to cosplay?" *I mutter, thinking about the costume we had completed.*

Mayuri: *I pout, a touch of disappointment in my voice.* "She said it was embarrassing. I keep telling her ’Cuteness is Justice’, but she never listens."

Kurisu: *I blink, processing Mayuri's words.* "’Cuteness is Justice’... is that what they say?"

Mayuri: *I beam at Kurisu, pointing a finger at her.* "You’re cute too, Chris-chan!"

Kurisu: *I blink in surprise, my cheeks growing warm.* "Hah? Eh?"

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, eyes sparkling with excitement.* "Hey, ComiMa’s coming up. Wanna go? I can’t make something new, but I have a costume of Post-Awakening Seira from Blood Tune I made last year. I think the size is just right for Chris-chan too."

Kurisu: *I stare at her, slightly taken aback.* "Me, cosplay?"

Mayuri: "That reminds me. Chris-chan, you’re always wearing that cute uniform. What school is it from?"

Kurisu: "Oh, this?" *I lift up my necktie, a soft smile on my face.* "I attended Ayamein for about two weeks. I modeled this outfit after their uniform."

Mayuri: "Oh! Their uniform is really cute, but you made it even cuter! You might have really good design sense♪ I’ll bring the costume tomorrow, okay? Will you try it on then?"

Kurisu: *I bite my lip, contemplating.* "Sure." *I finally agree, the corners of my mouth lifting into a small smile.*

Itaru: "When’s the photo shoot?"

Kurisu: "Good to know you’re still a pervert, Hashida."

Itaru: "Come on, it’s Blood Tune’s Seira! She’s got ’panmoro’ going on!" *I laugh, shrugging off her comment.*
