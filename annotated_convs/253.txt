Suzuha: *I lean against the wall, my arms crossed over my chest.* "Perhaps. But I know your true nature."

Kurisu: *I chuckle dryly, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Wow, you can see into my heart? That’s groundbreaking technology. I’d love to hear how it works."

Suzuha: *I meet her sarcasm with a steady gaze, my voice unwavering.* "It’s not science. It’s... a prediction."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, a smirk tugging at my lips.* "So you’re just making it up."

Suzuha: *I shrug, not bothered by her disbelief.* "I know."

Okabe: *I sense the tension in the room, my heart pounding in my chest.* Ah, this is a predicament.

Mayuri: *I tug at Okabe's sleeve, a pleading look in my eyes.* "Okarin."

Okabe: *I look down at Mayuri, her teary eyes breaking my heart.* 

Mayuri: *I sniffle, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Stop them from fighting."

Okabe: *I chuckle, puffing out my chest.* "Heh... this looks like a job for the one and only Hououin Kyouma."

Okabe: *With a dramatic flourish, I step between Suzuha and Kurisu.* "Break it up, you two! I, Hououin Kyouma, shall decide this dispute!"

Okabe: *I meet their glares with a grin, though fear gnaws at my insides. I turn to Kurisu.* "Assistant! I didn’t raise you this way."

Kurisu: *I snort, crossing my arms over my chest.* "You didn’t raise me at all."

Okabe: *I wag my finger at her, my voice firm.* "If you want to become a true mad scientist, you must learn to keep your emotions in check even as you cackle your way to victory!"

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, not amused.* "Nobody asked you. And I’m already a scientist."

Okabe: *I turn my attention to Suzuha.* "Warrior! Your enemy is SERN, remember? You must conserve your strength for Ragnarok."

Suzuha: *I lock eyes with him, my voice stern.* "I warned you before, Okabe Rintaro. Makise Kurisu is a threat."

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat at her words.* "Wha--"

Kurisu: *I narrow my eyes, suspicion creeping into my voice.* "Oh? What’s this about, Okabe?"

Okabe: *I feel their stares drilling into me, my heart pounding in my chest. I force a laugh, trying to defuse the tension.* "MUHAHAHA! Looks like neither of you is willing to back down. So be it! Fight to your hearts’ content! Fight until there is no more fight to be had! Then, share a manly handshake by the river and let friendship blossom! But in the future, when it comes time for you to venture out into the real world, I hope you remember one thing... Nobody likes a mood-killer!"

Kurisu & Suzuha: *They both glare at me, their voices in unison.* "Shut up!"

Okabe: *Their combined anger sends a chill down my spine. I clutch my right arm, my heart pounding.* "Gah! Why now, of all times!? Calm down, right arm of mine!"

Okabe: *I turn back to Mayuri, my expression apologetic.* "I’m sorry, Mayuri. At his rate, I’ll end up hurting those two. I have no choice... the rest is up to you..."

Mayuri: *I puff out my cheeks, a sigh escaping my lips.* "Geez..."

Mayuri: *I walk over to Suzuha and Kurisu, my voice soft and pleading.* "Um, guys? Mayushii doesn’t like it when you fight. Let’s all get along, okay?"
