Okabe: *I blink, looking up from my work at the unexpected interruption.* "Hm?"

Mayuri: *Slowly, I turn around, surveying the lab with a gentle smile gracing my face.* "It’s been really lively here these past few weeks, huh?"

Okabe: *A soft laugh escapes my lips, my fingers pausing over the keys of the computer.* "Yeah, I guess it has."

Okabe: *My gaze drifts from Mayuri to the cluttered expanse of the lab, memories of the past few months flooding my mind.* "I established the Future Gadget Laboratory around the time I entered college. It was the first step in my plan to bring chaos to the world. That was around the middle of March this year, which means it’s been almost five months. Not half a month after it was established, Mayuri showed up -- I’m still not sure why -- and became a lab mem. For about a month, it was just me and Mayuri. Then, in early May, I finally got Daru to join. All it took was telling him that the lab is just a three-minute walk from MayQueen+Nyan².  This location on the outskirts of Akiba has always been quiet. Mayuri isn’t the type to object to every little thing like Kurisu, nor the type to make dumb jokes like Daru, so the lab was very peaceful back in those days. It was quite a pleasant place to be. And now the lab mem count has increased to eight. It happened in the blink of an eye, or so it seems. They didn’t come today, but Lukako visits occasionally, and Faris is a familiar face at MayQueen+Nyan². Or at least she was before MayQueen disappeared. I remember feeling out of place the first time I came to Akiba, but now, it’s like a second home."

Mayuri: *Clasping my hands together, my eyes sparkle with delight.* "It’s fun♪" *I can't help but feel a warm satisfaction at the growth of our little group.*

Mayuri: *Glancing around the lab, I wrinkle my nose slightly at the sight of the crowded space.* "Um, now that there are eight lab mems, Mayushii thinks it’s getting a little cramped in here. First, we don’t have enough chairs."

Okabe: *I glance at the sofa, acknowledging the truth in Mayuri's words.* "New chairs will take all my savings." *The thought of needing to get a part-time job again makes my stomach churn.*

Mayuri: *Frowning slightly, I reach out, gently touching Okabe's arm.* "I guess you can use some of my salary. We need a new microwave too. Otherwise, I can’t warm up my Juicy Chicken Number One."

Okabe: *I sigh, rubbing the back of my neck with a sheepish grin.* "Yeah, sorry about that." *The thought of cutting off Mayuri’s chicken supply might actually kill her.*

Okabe: "But Mayuri. When we turn over the Time Leap Machine, the reward money will solve all of our problems."

Mayuri: *My eyes widen, a hopeful smile spreading across my face.* "Will it be enough to pay for chairs and a microwave on top of the higher rent?"

Okabe: *Confidence rings in my voice as I reply,* "It’ll be enough. More than enough."

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my heart fluttering with joy.* "Wow! That’s great, Okarin♪"

Okabe: *I quirk an eyebrow, a teasing grin tugging at my lips.* "Why are you so happy?"

Mayuri: *With a twinkle in my eyes, I start counting on my fingers.* "Just look. We’ve made so many friends. There’s Daru-kun, Chris-chan, Luka-chan, Suzu-san, Moeka-san, Feris-chan, Braun-san, Nae-chan, and more!"
