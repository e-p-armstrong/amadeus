Okabe: *My sentence hangs in the air, unfinished.* "What do you--" *Before I can finish, an urgent news bulletin on the TV catches my eye. The subtitles spell out a nightmare. A bomb threat. My heart pounds in my chest.*

Suzuha: *Her eyes narrow as she reads the news.* "A bomb threat?" *Her voice is steady, but there's a hint of tension in her eyes.*

Itaru: *He leans back in his chair, a frown creasing his forehead.* "Hang on. Those lines all pass through Akiba. How is Mayu-shi gonna get home?"

Mayuri: *Her eyes widen and she clutches her phone.* "Oh yeah. I should call home."

Okabe: *A chill runs down my spine as I consider the implications.* 'A bomb threat... Could the bomb be at Akihabara Station?' *The thought sends a cold feeling coursing through my stomach.*

Suzuha: *She suddenly turns to me, her gaze piercing.* "Okabe Rintaro. I need to know. You’ve completed the Time Leap Machine, right?"

Okabe: *Caught off guard, I stutter out a response.* "Huh? Well, yeah..."

Suzuha: *Without missing a beat, she stands up.* "Okay. I just remembered I’ve got something to do. I’m going out." *With that, she leaves the lab, leaving behind a trail of questions.*

Kurisu: *She watches Suzuha leave, a puzzled look on her face.* "What’s wrong with her?"

Okabe: *Her sudden departure, her strange question about the Time Leap Machine... it all swirls in my mind, a storm of confusion and fear.* 'Who sent those threatening emails? What is happening?' *Images flash through my mind, each more terrifying than the last. SERN. Jellymen. The Committee of 300. The Time Leap Machine. I feel a lump in my throat.*

Kurisu: *She turns to me, her eyes reflecting a deep concern.* "We may have created a monster here..." *Her voice trails off, leaving behind a chilling silence.*
