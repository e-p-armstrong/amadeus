Planning stage:

The characters involved are Okabe, Suzuha, Itaru, Mayuri, and Kurisu. 

- Okabe: He is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, with a flair for the dramatic. He's also very intelligent and often gets lost in his own thoughts. He will be written with a sense of urgency and intensity, often overthinking situations. 

- Suzuha: She's a mysterious and serious character with a hidden agenda. Her actions should reflect her determination and secretive nature. 

- Itaru: He is a laid-back, cheerful character and a tech genius. His dialogue should reflect his relaxed nature and quick wit. 

- Mayuri: She is a sweet, cheerful, and somewhat naive character. Her actions will reflect her innocence and positivity. 

- Kurisu: She is a genius scientist, logical and straightforward. Her dialogue should reflect her rational thinking and somewhat reserved personality.

Anchor lines will be Suzuha's abrupt departure and Kurisu's final line, both of which hint at the gravity of the situation and the potential consequences of their actions.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *My sentence hangs in the air, unfinished.* "What do you--" *Before I can finish, an urgent news bulletin on the TV catches my eye. The subtitles spell out a nightmare. A bomb threat. My heart pounds in my chest.*

Suzuha: *Her eyes narrow as she reads the news.* "A bomb threat?" *Her voice is steady, but there's a hint of tension in her eyes.*

Itaru: *He leans back in his chair, a frown creasing his forehead.* "Hang on. Those lines all pass through Akiba. How is Mayu-shi gonna get home?"

Mayuri: *Her eyes widen and she clutches her phone.* "Oh yeah. I should call home."

Okabe: *A chill runs down my spine as I consider the implications.* 'A bomb threat... Could the bomb be at Akihabara Station?' *The thought sends a cold feeling coursing through my stomach.*

Suzuha: *She suddenly turns to me, her gaze piercing.* "Okabe Rintaro. I need to know. You’ve completed the Time Leap Machine, right?"

Okabe: *Caught off guard, I stutter out a response.* "Huh? Well, yeah..."

Suzuha: *Without missing a beat, she stands up.* "Okay. I just remembered I’ve got something to do. I’m going out." *With that, she leaves the lab, leaving behind a trail of questions.*

Kurisu: *She watches Suzuha leave, a puzzled look on her face.* "What’s wrong with her?"

Okabe: *Her sudden departure, her strange question about the Time Leap Machine... it all swirls in my mind, a storm of confusion and fear.* 'Who sent those threatening emails? What is happening?' *Images flash through my mind, each more terrifying than the last. SERN. Jellymen. The Committee of 300. The Time Leap Machine. I feel a lump in my throat.*

Kurisu: *She turns to me, her eyes reflecting a deep concern.* "We may have created a monster here..." *Her voice trails off, leaving behind a chilling silence.*
