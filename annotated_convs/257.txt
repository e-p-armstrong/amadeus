Moeka: *My voice rises in a threatening manner, echoing in the silent room.* "If you continue to resist, I'll have to resort to extreme measures."

Moeka: *Slowly, I lift my gun, my fingers wrapping tightly around the cold metal. The muzzle points towards Mayuri, the weight of my decision settling heavily in my chest.* "Shiina Mayuri is not needed."

Okabe: "Stop!" *I lunge towards Moeka, my heart pounding in my chest, desperation fueling my actions.*

Okabe: *Suddenly, a force hits my chin, causing a flash of white pain to explode in my vision.* "Gah!" *I fall to my knees, my body numbing and vision blurring.*

Mayuri: *Tears stream down my face as I reach out to Okabe.* "Okarin!" *I cry out, fear gripping my heart.*

Okabe: *Through the haze of pain, I see Mayuri reaching out to me, her face distorted by fear. Over her shoulder, Moeka readies her gun.* "No!" *I try to yell, but my voice comes out as a strangled gasp.*

Kurisu: *Fear chokes my voice as I scream.* "Mayuri! No!" 

Moeka: *My lips move mechanically, the words leaving my mouth like a mantra.* "For SERN... for FB... for SERN... for FB..." 

Okabe: *The world slows down as a sharp, dry crack echoes in the room. Blood splatters across my face, warm and sickening. I catch Mayuri's lifeless body, her frail form limp in my arms.* 

Itaru: "Wahhhhhhhhhhh!" *I scream, clutching my head and falling to my knees, the reality of what just happened crashing down on me.*

Mayuri: *I take a shallow breath, my voice barely a whisper.* "O...kari..."

Okabe: *Her name leaves my lips, sounding foreign and hollow.* "...Mayuri?"

Kurisu: *My heart feels like it's being ripped apart, my voice barely a whisper.* "No... no!"
