Okabe: *Red flames of fury surge through me, consuming my mind in a blistering inferno. Hate, rage, and the primal desire to destroy everything within my sight dominate my thoughts.* *Gently, I lay Mayuri's lifeless form on the floor and rise, the image of her still figure fuelling my anger.* *Without a second thought, I hurl myself towards Moeka, my vision blurring with the intensity of my emotions.*

Kurisu: "Okabe!" *I shout, a note of desperation in my voice. Before he can take a step towards Moeka, I grab his hand, trying to anchor him to reality.*

Kurisu: "You can’t!" *I plead, my voice barely more than a whisper, my grip tightening on his hand.*

Okabe: "Let me go! Let me go!" *I roar, struggling against Kurisu's grip, my gaze locked onto Moeka.*

Kurisu: "You can’t! They’ll kill you!" *I warn him, my voice rising in panic as I see Moeka's gun aimed at Okabe.*

Okabe: "You gonna kill me too!?" *I snarl at Moeka, my voice echoing with defiance and a hint of desperation.*

Moeka: "If you resist." *I say coldly, my finger already on the trigger.*

Kurisu: "Please, Okabe, do what she says. Okay? Otherwise, they’ll kill you too." *I beg, my voice trembling with fear.*

Okabe: *Ripping my hand from Kurisu’s grip, my vision narrows to a tunnel with Moeka on the other side. She won’t get away with this.* "She killed Mayuri in cold blood." *I think, my heart pounding with rage and grief.* "I’ll do the same to her!"

Kurisu: "No!" *I scream, but it's too late.*

Moeka: *I pull the trigger, the cold metallic sound echoing ominously in the room.*

Suzuha: "Get down!" *I shout, bursting into the room. In a flash, I knock one man down, then dart into another man’s range, elbowing him in the solar plexus.*

Suzuha: *I slide into the feet of the man at the rear, tripping him forward, and swiftly drive my knee into his face.*

Moeka: "Enough." *I command, my voice steady as I aim my gun at Suzuha’s face.*

Suzuha: *I don't back down, my gun trained on Moeka’s neck. It’s a standoff.* "Who are you?" *Moeka asks. I glance at Okabe.*

Suzuha: "42." *I reply cryptically.* "TV." *I add, hoping Okabe will understand.* "Turned on."

Moeka: "What..." *I start, confused, but then Kurisu suddenly springs up and dashes for the development room.* "Don’t move!" *I shout, my voice echoing in the room.*

Suzuha: "That’s my line!" *I retort, keeping my gun trained on Moeka, my gaze unwavering.*
