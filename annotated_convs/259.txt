Kurisu: *I swallow, my throat dry as I meet Okabe's gaze.* "Okabe..."

Okabe: *I clench my fists, my knuckles whitening.* "I’m going back!"

Kurisu: *I lunge forward, desperation in my voice.* "No! I should be the one to--" 

Okabe: *I interrupt her, swiftly grabbing her wrist to stop her.* "I will save Mayuri!" *I declare, my voice echoing through the room.*

Kurisu: *Her eyes widen in alarm.* "But what if it fails!?"

Okabe: *Ignoring her protests, I place the headgear onto my head. I can feel the warm trickle of blood from where Moeka’s last shot grazed me. The world is spinning, but I push through the pain.* 

Suzuha: *I shout from the corner of the room.* "Okabe Rintaro! One of them’s moving!"

Moeka: *I bark out an order, my voice cold and emotionless.* "Get in there! Kill them!"

Attacker A: *I stumble into the development room, cursing under my breath.* "Damn... kids!"

Okabe: *In a split-second decision, I grab Future Gadget No. 4: Moad Snake from the shelf and flick the switch. Smoke fills the room, obscuring my vision.*

Moeka: *I scream through the chaos, my voice filled with murderous intent.* "Kill them!"

Kurisu: *I gasp as a bullet grazes my side.* "Augh!"

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest.* "Kurisu!?"

Kurisu: *I struggle to breathe, gasping out between ragged breaths.* "Ugh, gh, Okabe!! Are you sure!? Are you sure about this!? Really!?"

Okabe: *Despite the pain shooting through my right arm, I shout back at her.* "Do it, Kurisu! Activate the machine! Agh!"

Okabe: *A blue-white light fills the room, and the floor shakes beneath me. I crouch down, holding the headset steady with one hand.* "Leaaaaaaaap!!" *I shout, pouring every ounce of willpower into this final leap through time.*

Okabe: *I wake up in a familiar scene, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Mayuri? ...Mayuri?"

Okabe: *I see her standing in front of a grave, her eyes vacant as she gazes at the sky. In her hands, an old pocket watch, her grandmother's. The silence is deafening.* "Mayuri?"
