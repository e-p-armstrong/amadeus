Okabe: *Suddenly, it feels as if reality has shattered and then reassembled itself around me. I blink, struggling to regain my senses, and find myself standing in the lab. The chill of my cellphone against my ear and the sight of the Time Leap Machine before me bring me back to the present.* "Ahhh..." *I gasp out, my breath echoing in the silence of the lab. I clench my fists, trying to steady my racing heart.*

Okabe: *I force myself to take a deep breath, the air filling my lungs like a balm. I swallow hard, the inside of my throat feels like a flame, but I resist the urge to cough, focusing instead on drawing in another breath.* "...ckhaah, haahh, haahh, hah..."

Okabe: *I can feel the sweat trickling down my forehead, an irritating distraction. I raise my hand to wipe it away, but the movement feels sluggish, disconnected. I blink, trying to dispel the feeling of unreality. Exhaustion, perhaps, or the aftereffects of the leap. I flex my fingers, feeling the familiar strength return. This is my body. This is my reality.*

Kurisu: *I hear a voice behind me, familiar and comforting. I turn to see Kurisu looking at me, her eyes filled with worry.* "Okabe? Are you listening?" 

Kurisu: *She hesitates, then asks,* "What was all that screaming for?"

Okabe: *I frown, struggling to make sense of her words. What screaming? I try to respond, but my voice comes out as a croak. I clear my throat, forcing the words out.* "...No, I’m fine."

Kurisu: "Then get ready to go already. We’re going shopping, remember?" *She says, looking at me expectantly.*

Okabe: *Shopping? The word triggers a flood of memories, each one lighting up my mind like a firework.* "...Shopping?"

Kurisu: *She nods, her expression serious.* "’Humans are temporal beings.’"

Okabe: *I remember now. I used the Time Leap Machine. The realization hits me like a tidal wave, leaving me breathless.* "Ah... ah..."

Kurisu: *Her words echo in my mind, a stark reminder of what I've done.* "You’ll remember the future."

Okabe: *A sudden urgency propels me forward.* "Where am I?" *I ask, my voice desperate.*

Kurisu: *She blinks at me, taken aback.* "Huh?"

Okabe: *I reach out, grabbing Kurisu's shoulders and pulling her close.* "What time is it now!? What month? What day!?" *I demand, my words tumbling out in a rush.*

Kurisu: *She winces, trying to pull away.* "Hey, that hurts! Calm down!"

Okabe: *But I can't calm down. Not now.* "How can I be calm!? Shopping? You said we’re going shopping?"

Itaru: *I turn to Itaru, who's staring at us from his computer, his eyes wide with shock.* "Daru! What day is it!? What time is it!?"

Itaru: *He stammers, clearly taken aback by my sudden intensity.* "Uh, ummm, well, it’s the 13th... a little past 5."

Okabe: *The 13th, a little past 5... The numbers echo in my mind, bringing a sense of relief and apprehension. Did I succeed? Did I really leap through time?* "...Did it work?"
