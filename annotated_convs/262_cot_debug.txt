Planning:

Characters:
1. Okabe: The protagonist, a self-proclaimed mad scientist who is eccentric, dramatic, but deeply caring about his friends. His *actions* and *thoughts* will often reflect his internal struggle between his larger-than-life persona and his genuine concern.
2. Itaru: Okabe's friend, a hacker and otaku. He is laid-back, loves anime and games, and has a somewhat perverted sense of humor. His *actions* will often reflect his laid-back, casual demeanor.
3. Mayuri: Okabe's childhood friend, a sweet, cheerful girl with an innocent personality. Her *actions* should reflect her upbeat nature and her love for cosplay.
4. Kurisu: A genius neuroscientist, Kurisu is serious, logical, and often tsundere. Her *actions* should reflect her logical, analytical nature and occasional awkwardness in social situations.

Anchor lines:
1. Okabe: "It must have been a dream. There’s no way something like that could really happen." - This line shows Okabe's desperate attempts to rationalize his disturbing dream.
2. Mayuri: "You don’t have to show anyone, but eventually, you’ll want them to see. The cosplay demon compels you!" - This line reveals Mayuri's passion for cosplay and her belief in sharing what you love with others.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I scan the lab anxiously, my gaze flitting over the familiar equipment, the half-eaten cup noodles, the worn-out couch. But it's not the same without her.* "Where's Mayuri!?"

Itaru: *I glance up from my computer screen, pushing my glasses up the bridge of my nose.* "Uh, she just left saying she was going to Luka-shi’s place. Weren’t you listening?"

Okabe: *The words trigger a memory, an image of Mayuri pleading with Lukako to wear her costume. But was it just a memory, or a premonition? I can't tell anymore. My heart pounds in my chest, my mind a whirlpool of fear and uncertainty.* "Whew..." *I let out a sigh, trying to steady my shaking hands.* "It must have been a dream. There’s no way something like that could really happen."

Itaru: *I give Okabe a strange look, then shrug, deciding it's just one of his usual mad scientist antics.*

Mayuri: *I burst into the lab with a bright smile, my voice ringing out in cheerful greeting.* "Tutturu♪ I’m back!"

Okabe: *A wave of relief washes over me at the sight of Mayuri, alive and unharmed. I brush it off as unnecessary worry, deciding to focus on the meeting ahead.* "Oh. Do they have plans?"

Mayuri: *I nod, my fingers playing with the hem of my dress as I relay the news.* "Feris-chan has a RaiNet tournament."

Itaru: *My eyes widen, and I slam my hand against my forehead.* "Crap, I should’ve gone to cheer! How careless of me!"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a puzzled expression on my face.* "And Luka-chan seemed embarrassed for some reason."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, a teasing smile tugging at the corners of my lips.* "Maybe she thinks you’ll make her wear a costume again."

Okabe: *A sense of deja vu hits me, the words echoing in my mind like a broken record. I shake off the unsettling feeling, forcing a smirk onto my face.* "You still haven’t convinced her to cosplay?"

Mayuri: *I pout, folding my arms across my chest.* "She said it was embarrassing. I keep telling her ’Cuteness is Justice’, but she never listens..."

Kurisu: *I blink, caught off guard by the phrase.* "’Cuteness is Justice’... is that what they say?"

Mayuri: *I beam at Kurisu, my eyes sparkling with excitement.* "You’re cute too, Chris-chan!"

Kurisu: *I blush, taken aback by the sudden compliment.* "Hah? Eh?"

Mayuri: *I clasp my hands together, my eyes twinkling with anticipation.* "Hey, ComiMa’s coming up. Wanna go? I can’t make something new, but I have a costume of Post-Awakening Seira from Blood Tune I made last year. I think the size is just right for you too."

Kurisu: *I hesitate, my cheeks still flushed from the unexpected praise.* "Me, cosplay? I’m sorta interested. But I refuse to do it in public, though."

Mayuri: *I giggle, nudging Kurisu playfully.* "You don’t have to show anyone, but eventually, you’ll want them to see. The cosplay demon compels you!" *I tilt my head, studying Kurisu's uniform with curiosity.* "That reminds me. Chris-chan, you’re always wearing that cute uniform. What school is it from?"

Kurisu: *I glance down at my uniform, a small smile playing on my lips.* "Oh, this? I attended Ayamein for about two weeks. I modeled this outfit after their uniform."

Mayuri: *My eyes light up, a gasp of admiration escaping my lips.* "Oh! Their uniform is really cute, but you made it even cuter! You might have really good design sense♪ I’ll bring the costume tomorrow, okay? Will you try it on then?"
