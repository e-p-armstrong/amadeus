Mayuri: *I shift uncomfortably, looking around at the group with pleading eyes.* "Um, guys? Mayushii doesn’t like it when you fight. Let’s all get along, okay?"

Okabe: *I watch as Daru saunters over to Suzuha, their voices merging into a low murmur that gradually restores peace to the lab. My gaze drifts to Kurisu, who is tucked away in the development room, her voice barely audible as she makes a call. Probably to her mother in America. Sinking into the sofa, I aimlessly flick through channels on the TV, the taste of Dr P lingering on my tongue. But the images flashing on the screen don't register, their meaning lost in the whirlwind of my thoughts. I barely notice Mayuri settling beside me, peeling a banana with a serene smile.*

Mayuri: *She turns to me, her voice filled with innocent joy.* "Hey, Okarin. It’s been really lively here these past few weeks, huh?"

Okabe: *I flinch inwardly. Her words echo through my mind, a haunting reminder of a nightmare I desperately want to forget. It was a dream. It has to be a dream.*

Mayuri: *Her smile widens, her eyes sparkling with unadulterated happiness.* "It’s fun♪"

Okabe: *I can't bring myself to respond, my gaze fixed on the television screen, my mind lost in a sea of turbulent thoughts.*

Mayuri: *Her voice carries a hint of concern now.* "Um, now that there are eight lab mems, Mayushii thinks it’s getting a little cramped in here. First, we don’t have enough chairs. We should buy more. Do you have money, Okarin?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, unable to utter a word. I can't meet her gaze, a strange fear gripping me.*

Mayuri: *Her voice is soft, almost a whisper.* "I guess you can use some of my salary. We need a new microwave too. Otherwise, I can’t warm up any Juicy Chicken Number One. Okarin... are you okay? You don’t look so good."

Okabe: *I manage a weak smile, trying to mask my inner turmoil.* "It’s nothing..."

Mayuri: *Her eyes fill with worry.* "Are you feeling sick? Then you need to rest. Want to lie down? You can lie on my lap, okay?"

Okabe: "I’m not--"

Suzuha: *The television interrupts me with an urgent news bulletin, the words Terrorist bomb threat suspends Yamanote, Sobu, Keihin-Tohoku lines flashing ominously on the screen. Suzuha's voice slices through the silence.* "A bomb threat?"

Itaru: *He glances at the screen, his brows furrowed in concern.* "Hang on. Those lines all pass through Akiba. How is Mayu-shi gonna get home?"

Mayuri: *She jumps up, her face paling.* "Oh yeah. I should call home."

Okabe: *I feel the blood drain from my face, a cold dread seizing me.* "No... it can’t be..." 

Suzuha: *Her voice is sharp, demanding my attention.* "Okabe Rintaro. I need to know."

Okabe: *I struggle to breathe, my mind screaming in denial. It was a dream.*

Suzuha: *Her words hang heavy in the air, the gravity of her question making my heart pound.* "You’ve completed the Time Leap Machine, right?"

Okabe: *I feel a chill run down my spine. It had to be a dream. But if it was a dream, then why...*

Suzuha: *Her voice is sharp, piercing the silence.* "Are you listening?"

Itaru: *He interrupts, his voice filled with a strange mix of excitement and trepidation.* "Uh, the Time Leap Machine’s done."

Suzuha: *She stands abruptly, her voice steady.* "Okay. I just remembered I’ve got something to do. I’m going out."

Okabe: *I watch in stunned silence as Suzuha leaves the lab without another word.*

Kurisu: *She appears from the development room, her brows furrowed in confusion.* "What’s wrong with her?"
