Okabe: *Daru's screams echo in my ears, a harsh, grating sound that tears through the silence. I hold Mayuri in my arms, her breaths coming in long, ragged gasps. Then...* "O...kari..." *Her voice is barely a whisper, the sound fading into nothingness.*

Kurisu: *I can't believe what I'm seeing. This can't be happening. Not again.* "No... no!"

Okabe: *Mayuri's lifeless body lies in my arms, her face a mask of pain, covered in blood. Her blood, warm and sticky, stains my hands. I can't move, can't think, can't breathe.*

Moeka: *I hear a voice, cold and merciless, cutting through the numbness.* "You three come with us. Now. No more warnings. Resist, and we will kill you too."

Okabe: *I lay Mayuri down on the floor, my heart aching with regret and sorrow. I failed her. I failed her again. Rage boils up inside me, consuming me, and I stand up, taking one menacing step towards Moeka.*

Kurisu: *I react without thinking, my hand shooting out to grab Okabe's.* "Okabe!" *I can't let him do this. I can't let him throw his life away.* "You can’t!"

Okabe: *I try to pull away from Kurisu, my voice raw with grief and anger.* "Let me go!"

Kurisu: *I tighten my grip on his hand, desperate to make him understand.* "You can’t! They’ll kill you!"

Okabe: *I stare at Moeka, her gun pointed at my head, her finger on the trigger.* "You gonna kill me too!?"

Moeka: *My voice is steady, emotionless.* "If you resist."

Kurisu: *I plead with Okabe, my voice shaking with fear.* "Please, Okabe, do what she says. Okay? Otherwise, they’ll kill you too."

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, forcing down the anger and despair.* "Gh...!"

Suzuha: *Suddenly, a small stone strikes Moeka’s gun hand, causing her to drop her weapon. I seize the opportunity, shouting at the others.* "Get down!"

Okabe: *I watch in stunned silence as Suzuha takes down the attackers with swift, precise maneuvers. As she points her gun at Moeka, I finally understand what I need to do.*

Suzuha: *I glance at Okabe, giving him a significant look.* "TV." *I hope he understands.*

Okabe: *I make a break for the development room, Kurisu hot on my heels. I grab the headgear and jam it on my head, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Kurisu: *I try to stop him, to make him think.* "Okabe, I--"

Okabe: *I cut her off, my voice filled with determination.* "I’m going back!"

Kurisu: *I can't hide the fear in my voice.* "But what if it fails!?"

Okabe: *I can't afford to think about that now.* "Get the machine started!"
