Okabe: *Before the crew-cut man has a chance to enter the development room, I slam my hand onto the switch.* "Do it, Kurisu! Activate the machine!" *The room fills instantly with white smoke, rendering it impossible to see.*

Kurisu: *Her voice echoes out, filled with worry and surprise.* "Are you sure, Okabe!? Are you sure about this!? Really!?"

Okabe: *Through the thick smoke, I see a blue-white light beginning to shine. The discharge is starting! The light rapidly grows brighter, the floor begins to shake.* "Please! Give me one more chance!" *I crouch down, holding the headset steady with one hand. The singularity is open! This is reality. It wasn’t a dream. I etch that fact into my mind as I brace myself for the time leap.*

Okabe: *Once more, the world explodes into light. I can’t hear anything. It feels like something is crushing my eardrums. I let out a strained grunt, my body convulsing as if struck by lightning.* "Ah!"

Okabe: *Slowly, the shattered pieces of the world reform. I find myself standing in the lab development room, in front of the Time Leap Machine with my phone to my ear.* "...Gh."

Okabe: *My brain throbs again. This isn’t like a headache. It’s somehow deeper. With the pain comes a torrent of emotions -- sorrow, longing, hope, joy -- that threatens to wash away my psyche.* "...It worked again." *I reassure myself.*

Okabe: *I quickly make my way back to the lounge, almost crashing into Kurisu.*

Kurisu: *She lets out a surprised yelp.* "Kya! You surprised me! Don’t startle me like that."

Okabe: *Ignoring her complaint, I turn to Itaru, urgency lacing my voice.* "Daru! Is it just before 5 on the 13th!?"

Itaru: *He seems taken aback, but quickly checks the time.* "Eh? Um... yeah?"

Okabe: *Relief washes over me.* "You’re a genius." *I pat Kurisu on the shoulders, almost in an embrace, gratitude filling my voice.*

Kurisu: *She stammers, flustered by the sudden praise and physical contact.* "W-what’s gotten in to you? Stop manhandling me. It’s gross."

Okabe: *Ignoring her again, I scramble for my phone, dialing Mayuri's number.*

Mayuri: *Her cheerful voice rings out from the phone.* "Tutturu♪ Mayushii here."

Okabe: *Desperate, I try to interrupt.* "Mayuri! Where are--"

Mayuri: *Her pre-recorded message cuts me off.* "But I can’t answer the phone right now. Please leave your message after the beep♪"

Okabe: "Mayuri! Contact me at once! Okay? At once!" *I hang up and look at my watch again. It’s just past 5.*

Kurisu: *She looks at me with concern, sensing my urgency.* "Okabe? You look kind of crazy. What’s wrong?"

Okabe: *Ignoring their worried looks, I make my decision.* "Both of you get out of here. Now."

Kurisu: *Her eyes widen in surprise at my abrupt command.* "...What’s this about?"
