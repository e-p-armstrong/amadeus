Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, my tone laced with incredulity.* "Is this another one of your fantasies?"

Okabe: *I don’t have time to engage in our usual banter. Swiftly, I sidestep her and bolt out of the lab, my lab coat flapping behind me.*

Kurisu: *I call out after him, confusion and concern seeping into my voice.* "Okabe! Where are you going? Hey!"

Okabe: *I sprint full speed to Yanabayashi Shrine, my heart pounding in my chest, my lungs gasping for air. Sweat begins to coat my body as the sun beats down relentlessly. Finally, I stagger into the shrine's courtyard, my eyes scanning the area for a familiar face.*

Okabe: *I spot Lukako, standing alone, broom in hand.* "Lukako!"

Luka: *I jump, surprised at his sudden appearance, then bow my head respectfully.* "...Ah, Okabe-san! What’s wrong?"

Okabe: *I barely give myself time to catch my breath before blurting out my question.* "Mayuri! Where’s Mayuri!?"

Luka: *A look of confusion crosses my face.* "Um, Mayuri-chan already left."

Okabe: *My heart sinks.* "She left!?"

Luka: *I nod slowly, my voice soft.* "Yes... Um... when you see her, could you tell her that I’m sorry? I’d really prefer not to cosplay... I don’t want to disappoint her, but it’s too embarrassing to dress like that in front of people..."

Okabe: *I bite back a sigh of frustration. There's no time for this.* "Mayuri went back to the lab?"

Luka: "Eh? Um... I think so."

Okabe: *I frown, my mind racing to make sense of the situation. Time's running out. I need to find her.* "She didn’t say she was dropping by somewhere?"

Luka: "No... I didn’t ask... Um... is something wrong?"

Okabe: *I give her a stern look.* "If Mayuri comes back here, tell her to call me right away!"

Luka: "O-okay!"

Okabe: *I race back to the lab, praying that I'll find Mayuri there. But as I burst through the door, I find only Daru, engrossed in his computer.*

Okabe: *I shout out, my voice echoing in the empty lab.* "Where’s Mayuri!? Did she come back!?"

Itaru: "Huh? No."

Okabe: *A wave of desperation washes over me.* "Kuh! Where is she!?"

Okabe: *I grab a bottle of Dr P from the fridge, chugging it down to quench my parched throat and calm my frantic thoughts.*

Itaru: *I look up from my computer, finally noticing Okabe's distress.* "Hey, Okarin. Why are you so jumpy?"

Okabe: *I slam the empty bottle on the table, my voice desperate.* "I need to find Mayuri!"

Itaru: "Isn’t she at Luka-shi’s?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, my hands clenching into fists.* "Not anymore. She was gone by the time I got there."

Okabe: *I start to pace the room, my mind whirling with worry and frustration.*

Itaru: "Maybe she went to see one of her cosplay friends?"
