Itaru: *I shrug, my hands outstretched in a gesture of innocence.* "How should I know?" *I question, unable to provide the answers Okabe seeks.*

Okabe: *I run a hand through my hair, frustration gnawing at me.* "Damn. It’s easy to forget, since she’s usually here, but Mayuri and I rarely spend time together outside of the lab. MayQueen and the shrine. That’s about it. I have no idea where else she might go. MayQueen doesn’t even exist on this worldline."

Itaru: *My eyes widen a little in realization.* "Ah, now that you mention it."

Okabe: *I snap my head to face him, my heart hammering against my ribcage.* "Do you know something!?"

Itaru: *I rub the back of my neck, trying to recall.* "I think she said that her phone was about to run out of power. She had to turn it off."

Okabe: *I feel a wave of despair wash over me.* "Yet another setback. Not only am I unable to contact her, she might not even notice my phone calls."

Itaru: *I furrow my brow, concern etched on my face.* "Hey, what’s going on?"

Okabe: *I glare at him, my voice rising in frustration.* "...Why are you still here, Daru? I thought I told you to leave!" *I slump onto the sofa, the weight of stress pressing down on me.*

Itaru: *I cross my arms, my gaze steady on Okabe.* "I’m not leaving without a good reason. Tell me what’s going on, man."

Okabe: *My voice breaks, the words tumbling out.* "...They’re going to kill Mayuri."

Itaru: *I stare at Okabe, my eyes wide in shock.* "What?"

Okabe: *I can barely keep my voice steady.* "SERN’s after us. In two hours, their men will break in and kill Mayuri. Get out while you still can!"

Itaru: *My voice shakes as I question him.* "What? For real?"

Okabe: *I nod, my gaze pleading.* "Can you get in touch with Kurisu? Pass the message onto her."

Itaru: *I blink at him, still trying to process everything.* "In two hours? How do you know that?"

Okabe: *I watch as Daru's gaze shifts to the development room, where the Time Leap Machine is sitting.*

Itaru: *I turn back to Okabe, my voice full of disbelief.* "No way. You used it?"

Okabe: *I nod gravely, my gaze unwavering.* "Yes, I did. Now, get out of here, Daru." *I send Daru home, and then I sit, waiting for Mayuri to return, all while trying to convince myself that everything will be okay.*

Suzuha: *I emerge from the Braun Tube Workshop, curiosity piqued.* "Huh?"

Okabe: *Startled, I turn towards Suzuha and Mister Braun.* "I forgot about Suzuha," *I mutter under my breath.*

Suzuha: *I tilt my head, studying Okabe.* "What are you doing here, Okabe Rintaro?"

Okabe: *I shrug, trying to keep my voice steady.* "Nothing..."
