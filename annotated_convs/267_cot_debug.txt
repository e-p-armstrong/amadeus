Planning:

1. Okabe: He's the protagonist of Steins;Gate, and he is currently under a lot of stress due to the situation involving Mayuri. He is the mad scientist, flamboyant and eccentric, but also deeply caring for his friends. His actions and thoughts will be filled with tension and urgency.

2. Itaru: Itaru is Okabe's best friend, and he is also a member of the Future Gadget Lab. He is a bit laid-back and relaxed, and often acts as the comic relief. However, he is also very loyal to his friends. His actions and thoughts will reflect his concern for Okabe and Mayuri, as well as his confusion about the situation.

3. Suzuha: She is a part-timer at the Braun Tube Workshop and is also a time traveler. She is serious, determined, and somewhat mysterious. Her actions and thoughts will be more guarded, as she is not completely open about her intentions and motivations.

Anchor Lines:
1. Okabe: "...They’re going to kill Mayuri."
2. Okabe: "...The Time Leap Machine doesn’t matter. Moeka can have it. My top priority is to prevent Mayuri’s death."

Roleplay:

Itaru: *I shrug, my hands outstretched in a gesture of innocence.* "How should I know?" *I question, unable to provide the answers Okabe seeks.*

Okabe: *I run a hand through my hair, frustration gnawing at me.* "Damn. It’s easy to forget, since she’s usually here, but Mayuri and I rarely spend time together outside of the lab. MayQueen and the shrine. That’s about it. I have no idea where else she might go. MayQueen doesn’t even exist on this worldline."

Itaru: *My eyes widen a little in realization.* "Ah, now that you mention it."

Okabe: *I snap my head to face him, my heart hammering against my ribcage.* "Do you know something!?"

Itaru: *I rub the back of my neck, trying to recall.* "I think she said that her phone was about to run out of power. She had to turn it off."

Okabe: *I feel a wave of despair wash over me.* "Yet another setback. Not only am I unable to contact her, she might not even notice my phone calls."

Itaru: *I furrow my brow, concern etched on my face.* "Hey, what’s going on?"

Okabe: *I glare at him, my voice rising in frustration.* "...Why are you still here, Daru? I thought I told you to leave!" *I slump onto the sofa, the weight of stress pressing down on me.*

Itaru: *I cross my arms, my gaze steady on Okabe.* "I’m not leaving without a good reason. Tell me what’s going on, man."

Okabe: *My voice breaks, the words tumbling out.* "...They’re going to kill Mayuri."

Itaru: *I stare at Okabe, my eyes wide in shock.* "What?"

Okabe: *I can barely keep my voice steady.* "SERN’s after us. In two hours, their men will break in and kill Mayuri. Get out while you still can!"

Itaru: *My voice shakes as I question him.* "What? For real?"

Okabe: *I nod, my gaze pleading.* "Can you get in touch with Kurisu? Pass the message onto her."

Itaru: *I blink at him, still trying to process everything.* "In two hours? How do you know that?"

Okabe: *I watch as Daru's gaze shifts to the development room, where the Time Leap Machine is sitting.*

Itaru: *I turn back to Okabe, my voice full of disbelief.* "No way. You used it?"

Okabe: *I nod gravely, my gaze unwavering.* "Yes, I did. Now, get out of here, Daru." *I send Daru home, and then I sit, waiting for Mayuri to return, all while trying to convince myself that everything will be okay.*

Suzuha: *I emerge from the Braun Tube Workshop, curiosity piqued.* "Huh?"

Okabe: *Startled, I turn towards Suzuha and Mister Braun.* "I forgot about Suzuha," *I mutter under my breath.*

Suzuha: *I tilt my head, studying Okabe.* "What are you doing here, Okabe Rintaro?"

Okabe: *I shrug, trying to keep my voice steady.* "Nothing..."
