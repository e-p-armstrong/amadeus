Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, my heart pounding in my chest as I attempt to keep my voice steady.* "How did you know we’re having a party?"

Suzuha: *I tilt my head slightly, a small smirk playing on my lips.* "Shiina Mayuri. She came by earlier today to invite me over. Hope you’ve got room for one more, ’cuz I’m--"

Okabe: *I interrupt, my voice sharper than I intended.* "You can’t!"

Suzuha: *I frown, my shoulders dropping slightly in surprise.* "Um... am I a bother?"

Okabe: *I sigh, rubbing my temples as I try to soften my tone.* "...No."

Suzuha: *I give a small smile, trying to lighten the mood.* "It’s okay. I understand. I guess I’m still an outsider."

Okabe: *I shake my head frantically, my hands moving in an attempt to explain.* "That’s not it!"

Tennouji: *I grumble, crossing my arms over my chest.* "What’s wrong with you, Okabe? Let my part-timer join your little club. You owe her, remember? It’s thanks to her belly that I let ya’ off the hook for shaking the building last time."

Suzuha: *I glance down at my belly, my cheeks flushing with embarrassment.* "My belly? Hey!"

Tennouji: *I chuckle, winking at Suzuha.* "She’s got a fine belly. Tight and well trained."

Suzuha: *I cross my arms over my chest, scowling at Tennouji.* "I’m standing right here, you dirty old man."

Okabe: *I clench my fists, my voice shaking with a mix of desperation and frustration.* "The party is canceled. I’m sorry, Part-Time Warrior, but please go home today."

Suzuha: *I blink in surprise, my smile fading.* "Canceled?"

Okabe: *I nod, trying to smile but failing miserably.* "Yeah. Sorry."

Tennouji: *I frown, scratching my beard thoughtfully.* "I don’t know what’s going on, Okabe, but don’t do anything reckless."

Okabe: *I look at Tennouji in surprise, not expecting advice from him.* "...Huh?"

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, trying to come up with a plausible excuse.* "I... got in a fight with Mayuri. Things are a little complicated right now. That’s all."

Suzuha: *I raise an eyebrow, my curiosity piqued.* "Oh, is there gonna be blood?"

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat at Suzuha's words.* "Blood?"

Suzuha: *I point across the street, a teasing smile on my face.* "I mean, look over there."

Okabe: *I follow Suzuha's gaze and my heart leaps in my chest when I see Mayuri.* 

Suzuha: *I chuckle, shrugging my shoulders nonchalantly.* "Huh? Weren’t you fighting? She looks really happy to see you."

Okabe: *Ignoring Suzuha, I bolt towards Mayuri, my heart pounding in my chest.* 

Suzuha: *I call after him, my voice filled with confusion.* "Hey! Where are you going!?"

Okabe: *I grab Mayuri's hand, pulling her along as I run.* "Run! To the station!"

Mayuri: *I stumble, trying to keep up with Okabe's pace.* "Wawawa... W-w-wait! My bag..."

Okabe: *I look back at Mayuri, my voice urgent.* "Forget it! Just run!"

Mayuri: *I blink in surprise, struggling to keep up.* "Eh? Why?"

Okabe: *I glance back at Mayuri, trying to convey the urgency of the situation.* "Just run!"

Mayuri: *I don't question Okabe any further, matching his pace despite my confusion.* 

Mayuri: *I pant, trying to keep up with Okabe's frantic pace.* "Hey, where are we going?"

Okabe: *I gasp for breath, trying to come up with a destination.* "Haah, haah, haah, first we’ll head for, haah, Tsukuba or Yokohama..."
