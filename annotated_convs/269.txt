Okabe: *My breaths come in ragged gasps, my heart pounding as if trying to escape from my chest.* "No... stopping... until... we’re on... the train..." *I push the words out through gritted teeth, my determination overriding the screaming protests of my body.*

Mayuri: *I look at Okabe worriedly, my hand fluttering to his shoulder. His skin is hot and slick with sweat.* "But Okarin, you’re covered in sweat. You shouldn’t push yourself. You’re not good at exercise."

Premise Announcer: *The voice echoes around us, the words cutting through the chaos like a knife.* "Your attention please. The Yamanote, Keihin-Tohoku, and Sobu Lines are currently suspended. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, and kindly ask for your cooperation."

Okabe: *A cold realization seizes me, the blood draining from my face.* "Of course... the bomb threat..." *The words escape in a whisper, more to myself than to Mayuri. How could I have forgotten such a crucial detail? The panic surges, threatening to consume me.*

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my eyes wide with confusion.* "I wonder what happened..." 

Okabe: *With a start, I spin around, pulling Mayuri along. My mind races, already planning our next move. But before we can take more than a few steps, a figure steps out from the crowd, blocking our path.*

SERN Agent: *I square my shoulders, my gaze fixed on Okabe.* "Okabe Rintaro?"

Mayuri: *I grip Okabe's arm tightly, my voice trembling.* "Okarin, do you know these people?"

SERN Agent: *I stare at Okabe, my voice calm and steady.* "Come with us."

Okabe: *I jerk away, my eyes narrowing suspiciously.* "Who are you?"

SERN Agent: *Ignoring his question, I reach out to grab his arm.* "If you resist, we’ll kill you."

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest, a cold dread gripping me.* "SERN!" *The word slips out, a hiss of fear and realization. The trap has been sprung, and we walked right into it.*

Okabe: *I square my shoulders, forcing a defiant smirk onto my face.* "Are you going to kill us with all these witnesses around?" *The words hang heavy in the air, a final desperate challenge to our captors.*
