Kurisu: *I rub my temples, trying to ease the headache that's throbbing behind my eyes.* "Don’t shout... I’ve been working all night, so let me rest a bit..."

Okabe: *My voice cracks with desperation, my gaze darting around the room.* "Where is Mayuri!?"

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, looking at Okabe with confusion.* "What’s wrong with you? She went to Luka-shi’s, remember?"

Okabe: *My heart sinks in my chest. Damn, she already left? I fumble for my phone, my fingers trembling as I try to dial her number. I need to get in touch with her somehow! Mayuri went to see someone after leaving the shrine. The question is who. I rack my brain, trying to consider every possibility.*

Mayuri: *I hear the familiar jingle of her voice mail.* "Tutturu♪ Mayushii here."

Okabe: *I almost shout in relief, but then my words get cut off.*

Mayuri: *Her voice sounds so cheerful, so oblivious.* "But I can’t answer the phone right now."

Okabe: *A knot forms in my stomach. I got her voice mail?*

Mayuri: *Her voice mail message continues, sounding so normal, so mundane.* "Please leave your message after the beep♪"

Okabe: *My mind is racing. It’s the same as last time. Damn! Why did I forget? Before I time leaped, I should have asked Mayuri where she was today. I’m not thinking straight. I have to calm down. Wait... I know. Last time, we failed because we went to Akihabara Station. I should have known that SERN would be watching. This time, we’ll take a taxi to another station, then hide somewhere until things calm down. For now, all I can do is wait for Mayuri to return. It’s driving me crazy. I consider explaining the situation to Kurisu and Daru, but I just don’t have the strength to do that right now. Besides, I don’t want to get them involved. I’ll take care of it myself. I won’t let any more of my friends die.*

Luka: *I hear Luka's soft voice on the other end of the line.* "Hello. This is Urushibara."

Okabe: *I try to keep my voice steady.* "Lukako! It’s me! Okabe!"

Luka: *There's a pause, and then confusion.* "Okabe-san? What’s wrong?"

Okabe: *My words tumble out in a rush.* "Is Mayuri there? If she is, let me speak to her!"

Luka: *I can hear the hesitation in his voice.* "Okay. Just a moment please."

Mayuri: *My heart leaps when I hear her voice.* "Tutturu♪ Mayushii here. What’s up, Okarin?"

Okabe: *Relief washes over me. Finally... I’ve managed to get ahold of Mayuri. This will give us hours to spare.* "Where are you now? Yanabayashi Shrine!?"

Mayuri: *She sounds so calm, so unaware.* "Yup!"

Okabe: *I try to keep my voice steady, to not alarm her.* "I’m headed there now. Whatever you do, don’t move, okay!?"

Mayuri: *I hear the confusion in her voice.* "Huh? Why not?"

Kurisu: *I hear her voice from behind me, sounding groggy and confused.* "What’s all the commotion?"

Okabe: *I glance back at her, seeing her eyes half asleep.* "Daru. Assistant. Leave right now and get as far from Akiba as you can. But under no circumstances use the train."

Itaru: *He looks at me with wide eyes.* "What? Why?"

Okabe: *I try to keep my voice steady, to keep my fear from showing.* "If you can, go somewhere you don’t normally go, and stay there overnight. Understand?"

Itaru: *He grins, trying to lighten the mood.* "Wait, overnight? So you’re saying we should go to a love hotel and make hanky panky. I understand."

Kurisu: *She rolls her eyes, her voice dripping with sarcasm.* "Shut it, perv."

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu gets up, her movements slow and sluggish.* "What’s going on, Okabe?"

Okabe: *I swallow hard, trying to keep my voice steady.* "Please, just do as I say. We’ll talk later. Don’t come back to the lab until I say so!"
