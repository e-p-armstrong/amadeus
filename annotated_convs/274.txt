Mayuri: *I tilt my head slightly, my fingers nervously playing with the hem of my shirt as I gather my courage.* "Um, Okarin? Mayushii has a lot of questions, but she’ll wait for now. But once it’s over," *I say, looking up at him with hopeful eyes,* "I want you to tell me everything, okay?"

Okabe: *I nod, offering her a reassuring smile, a promise etched in the gentle lines of my face.* "Yeah, I promise."

Okabe: *As we wait for the train, I decide to make use of the time. I run a hand through my hair, my mind churning with questions and possibilities.* "Where did you go after you saw Lukako?"

Mayuri: *I blink, then my face brightens as I remember.* "I got an email from Fubuki-chan. A thread came loose on her costume. I went to fix it."

Okabe: *My brow furrows as I try to piece together the puzzle in front of me.* "Where does Fubuki-chan live?"

Mayuri: *I pause, trying to recall the details.* "Um, we met at the Starbecks at UPX."

Okabe: *I nod, mentally noting down the details. My gaze drifts to the station's noticeboard, the route map offering a visual representation of our journey ahead. I can feel the vibrations of the approaching train, the rumbling echoing the turmoil within me. I reach out for Mayuri's hand, then let it fall back to my side. We have time. We're safe... for now.*

Mayuri: *I start to speak, my voice barely audible over the roar of the approaching train.* "About the party tonight..."

Mayuri: *I continue, my words swallowed by the deafening sound.* "It got canceled, but we should definitely--"

Nae: *Suddenly, I spot Mayuri. I dash towards her, calling out excitedly,* "Mayuri♪"

Okabe: *I blink, confusion settling in as Mayuri's figure vanishes before my eyes.* "Huh?"
