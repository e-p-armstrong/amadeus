Planning:
Characters involved are Okabe and Kurisu. Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, prone to over-dramatization, and often indulges in his own world of delusions. However, underneath his eccentric exterior, he's a deeply thoughtful and caring individual. Kurisu is a genius scientist, often the voice of reason and logic. She's serious and pragmatic but also compassionate. Okabe's actions will be heavy with internal struggle, while Kurisu's will reflect her worry and determination. The anchor lines will be Okabe's final plea for help and Kurisu's initial intervention to prevent Okabe from breaking the machine.

Roleplay:
Kurisu: *I step forward, my eyes fixated on the chair held aloft in Okabe's trembling hands.* "Are you trying to break the machine? You don’t have to break it, Okabe. We already decided not to experiment. Remember?" *I watch him, my voice steady but laced with concern.* "Anyway, put the chair down."

Okabe: *I lower the chair slowly, my grip on the backrest loosening. I'm not doing this because Kurisu told me to, but because I'm beginning to realize the implications of my actions.* "I... I..."

Kurisu: *I take a step closer, my eyes never leaving Okabe's face.* "You look pale. What’s wrong? Are you listening?"

Okabe: *A shiver runs down my spine, and I turn away, unable to meet her gaze.* "I... I can't..."

Kurisu: *I reach out to him, my hand almost touching his arm.* "W-wait!"

Okabe: *Ignoring her call, I flee from the lab. My footsteps echo in the deserted streets, attracting curious glances from strangers. As I cross the pedestrian overpass, I squat down on the concrete, allowing the chaotic cacophony of the city to wash over me. I'm lost in the sea of thoughts, my mind racing with the reality of Mayuri's impending death.*

Kurisu: *I approach him slowly, my eyes softening at the sight of his hunched form.* "Hey. Don’t you think you’re a little old to be sitting on the ground in public?"

Okabe: *I lift my head slowly, my gaze meeting Kurisu's.* "...Christina."

Kurisu: *I tilt my head slightly, a hint of relief flashing across my face.* "What?"

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my voice barely more than a whisper.* "What time is it now?"

Kurisu: *I glance at my watch, my brow furrowed.* "5:38. Hey. If you have time to sit around, then you can help me with the shopping."

Okabe: *The mention of shopping triggers a wave of nostalgia. I remember the original timeline, the party preparations, the normalcy that now seems like a distant dream.* "Kurisu..."

Kurisu: *I blink, taken aback by his use of my real name.* "...That’s the first time you’ve said my name properly."

Okabe: *I keep my gaze fixed on the ground, unable to meet her eyes. The weight of my next words hangs heavy in the air.* "...Help me."
