Okabe: *I gulp, my throat dry as dust. My hands tremble, but I force them to still, clasping them tightly together.* "I need your help. I have to save Mayuri! I can’t do it alone, but together, we might have a chance. I want... I need to believe that! Please, lend me your strength."

Kurisu: *She lets out a sigh, her breath a soft puff in the stillness of the room. Her gaze, typically sharp and analytical, softens as she looks at me.* "You’re such a stubborn fool. What you’ve been through... I’m surprised it hasn’t broken you already."

Kurisu: *She turns away abruptly, her cheeks flushed. Even in her embarrassment, she maintains her composed demeanor.* "I’ll help. Mayuri’s my friend, and a fellow lab mem. And besides... I don’t want to see you in such pain."

Okabe: *I bow my head, my voice barely a whisper.* "I’m sorry."

Kurisu: *She shakes her head, a faint smile playing on her lips.* "Don’t apologize. Remember when I told you about my father? You really helped me out back then. Now it’s my turn to return the favor. I want to be your strength. Besides, you still have to come with me to Aomori."

Kurisu: *Her smile grows, becoming a teasing grin.* "I know you’re going to leap no matter what I say. You are a mad scientist, after all, and mad scientists play by their own rules. Hey. Aren’t you supposed to go ’muhahahaha’ or something?"

Okabe: *I chuckle, the sound hollow and strained.* "Yeah..."

Kurisu: *She rolls her eyes, but her grin remains.* "Why do I even try?"

Kurisu: "Anyway, I’m not doing this for you, okay? I’m doing it for Mayuri."

Okabe: *I nod, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Yeah, of course."

Kurisu: *She raises an eyebrow, her grin widening.* "That, and I think you’ll make a good test subject."

Okabe: *I scowl, my heart skipping a beat.* "Now you’re talking like SERN."

Kurisu: *She shakes her head, her grin not faltering.* "It’s completely different."

Okabe: *I cross my arms over my chest, my brow furrowed in thought.* "How so?"

Kurisu: *She chuckles, her eyes sparkling with mischief.* "I only experiment on you. Besides, mad scientists experiment on themselves all the time, don’t they?"

Okabe: *I sigh, my shoulders sagging.* "I guess..."

Kurisu: *She waves her hand dismissively.* "I-it’s just a joke. Don’t take it so seriously."

Kurisu: *She stands, checking her watch. Her face is serious again, her playful mood replaced by a sense of urgency.* "There’s not much time. I think you should have a clear plan before trying to change the future again."

Okabe: *I frown, my mind racing.* "Meaning?"

Kurisu: "Leap to an even earlier time. Then explain the situation to me again."

Kurisu: *She holds out her hand, her grip firm and reassuring.* "Let’s go."

Okabe: *I take her hand, pulling myself to my feet. As we make our way back to the lab, I can't help but feel a renewed sense of hope.*

Kurisu: "I understand why you can’t tell Mayuri, but why can’t you tell Hashida?"

Okabe: *I shrug, my gaze fixed on the floor.* "I’ll tell him when it’s necessary."
