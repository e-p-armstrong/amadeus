Okabe: *With a heavy sigh and a grim determination in my eyes, I gaze into the distance, my voice echoing the gravity of the situation.* "In a few seconds, it won’t have happened."

Kurisu: *I quietly hand him the headgear, a mix of curiosity and concern in my eyes.* "I see. That’s how it looks from your perspective. What does it look like from my perspective? What happens here after you leap?"

Okabe: *I look at her, my eyes weary, yet resolute.* "...You’ll know soon enough."

*I let my mind wander as I contemplate the intricacies of time travel. The implications of my actions, the potential diverging timelines... all these thoughts swirl in my mind like a whirlwind. Yet, amidst this chaos, my resolve remains unshaken - I must save Mayuri.*

Okabe: *Breaking my train of thought, I turn my attention back to Kurisu, noticing her fingers abruptly halt their dance on the keyboard.* "What’s wrong?"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, a far-off look in my eyes.* "It’s nothing. I was just thinking."

Okabe: *A thought strikes me, a potential theory.* "Maybe it works like a D-Mail."

*The D-Mails... those messages we sent to the past, altering our present. Only I remember what it was like before the change, thanks to my Reading Steiner ability.*

Kurisu: *I mull over his words, hoping against hope that he's incorrect.* "That would make things easier, though I kind of hope you’re wrong."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, curious.* "Because you can’t collect data if you can’t record the change?"

Kurisu: *I nod, my gaze focused back on the computer screen.* "Exactly."

*I quickly begin adjusting the settings of the Time Leap Machine, readying it for the impending leap.*

Kurisu: *I turn to Okabe, my voice steady and serious.* "I set the destination to five hours ago. You should arrive around 1:40 PM. I completed the Time Leap Machine just after 2. Do you remember?"

*Though it's only been hours for Kurisu, to me, it feels like weeks have passed. The memory is hazy, like a dream fading upon waking.*

Kurisu: *I offer a small smirk, a hint of teasing in my voice.* "Nobody likes a man who can’t remember dates. Be thankful that I make a habit of checking the time. I have a pretty good idea what happened when."

*After finishing the settings, I turn to face Okabe again, a serious look on my face.*

Kurisu: *I look straight into Okabe's eyes, emphasizing the importance of my words.* "Listen, Okabe. If you’re going to keep using the Time Leap Machine, there’s one thing you must remember. Don’t let go of your phone. Ever. It’s your lifeline. Your destination marker. As long as you keep it with you, you can leap to any time you want. But if you lose your phone... if someone else gets ahold of it..."

*The thought of my memories overwriting someone else's if I leap to that time sends a chill down my spine. I shudder at the potential consequences.*

Kurisu: *I take a deep breath, continuing my warning.* "If it breaks, or the battery dies..."

*The thought of losing my ability to leap, of being stuck in a time I don't want to be in, fills me with dread.*

Kurisu: *With a final, stern look, I reiterate.* "The time leap will fail. Once again, never let go of your phone."

Okabe: *I nod, understanding the gravity of her words.* "Got it."

Kurisu: *I give him a final instruction, my voice firm and decisive.* "After you leap back to this afternoon, just sit tight and don’t do anything until I complete the Time Leap Machine. If you accidentally prevent me from completing the machine, it will likely wreak havoc with the timeline. As soon as I finish, declare that we will not experiment. Then send everyone home. Ask me to stay. Tell me the truth. If you say you came from the future, I’ll probably believe you."
