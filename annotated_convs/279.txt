Kurisu: *I smirk, my gaze fixed on the computer screen.* "Who knows me better than myself?" *A faint grin pulls at the corners of my lips as I push back from the desk, standing up and stretching my aching muscles.*

Kurisu: "Don’t forget. It was my mad skillz that turned the PhoneWave into a time leap machine. When you told me about your time leap, I took it as proof that my theories were right." *My voice is steady, my eyes are bright with conviction.* "I was happy it succeeded. I really was. I didn’t doubt it was true for a second."

Okabe: *My eyes flicker over her face, trying to read the emotions hidden behind her scientific detachment.* "I see..."

Kurisu: *I chew on my bottom lip, trying to lighten the mood.* "Just to be safe, I should probably give you a passphrase. What I want the most right now is my own fork."

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, taken aback by her randomness.* "...What?"

Kurisu: *My face heats up as I wave my hands frantically.* "It doesn’t mean anything, okay!?"

Okabe: "You want your own fork?" *I can't help the incredulous laughter that escapes me.*

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, trying to regain some semblance of control.* "I already have my own spoon... wait, that doesn’t matter! Everything’s ready! Now get out of here!"

Okabe: *I nod, pulling out my phone and dialing up the PhoneWave (name subject to change).*

Kurisu: *I reach out, my fingers lightly brushing his shoulder.* "Be careful. And remember..." *I take a deep breath, forcing the words out despite the knot in my throat.* "I’m always on your side."

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu retreats, her touch lingering on my shoulder. I settle back onto the sofa, phone clutched tightly in my hand, bracing myself for the familiar sensation of time leaping.*

Mayuri: "Okarin, Okarin! Can you come here?" *I look up from my nearly completed costume, excitement bubbling up inside me.*

Okabe: *I push myself up from the sofa, walking over to Mayuri and her sewing machine.*

Mayuri: "Can you hold this for me? Spread it out like ’fwapp!’" *I give Okabe a wide grin, mimicking the motion with my hands.*

Itaru: "Mayu-shi, say ’fwapp’ again." *I chuckle, my fingers flying over the keyboard.*

Mayuri: *I giggle, repeating the sound.* "Fwapp!"

Itaru: "I got a fwapp!" *I laugh, my eyes twinkling with amusement.*

Kurisu: "Stop it, perv." *I roll my eyes, trying to hide my amusement.*

Okabe: *I follow Mayuri’s directions, spreading the costume out by the sleeves.*

Mayuri: "Hmm... Okay! Thanks." *I beam at Okabe, my tiredness momentarily forgotten.*

Mayuri: "All done♪" *I hold up the finished costume, my heart swelling with pride.*

Mayuri: "I finished before Chris-chan! We were racing." *I turn towards Kurisu, my eyes shining with playful challenge.*

Kurisu: "You win, Mayuri. Congratulations. But I’m finished too." *I connect the final cords, my fingers steady despite the thrill of completion.*

Kurisu: "Complete." *I announce, my voice echoing in the silent room.*

Okabe: "We’re not experimenting." *I interrupt her celebration, my voice grave.*

Kurisu: "Eh!?" *I whip around to face him, my heart sinking.*

Okabe: "Time leaping presents a host of problems. I want to consider them all carefully." *I explain, my gaze steady on her stunned face.*
