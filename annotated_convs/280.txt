Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my brows furrowing in confusion.* "Problems? I thought it was done?"

Okabe: *I sigh, rubbing my temples as I try to find the right words.* "I’ll explain later. Everyone’s tired, so let’s go home."

Itaru: *I glance at Okabe, disappointment clearly etched on my face.* "We’re not going to have a party to celebrate?"

Okabe: *I force a small smile, my gaze avoiding his.* "We’ll do that another day."

Okabe: *After successfully convincing Daru and Mayuri to leave, I lend Mayuri my phone charger, noticing how we use the same brand of phone. As Kurisu tries to leave, I subtly hold her back, my fingers lightly gripping her sleeve.*

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow at Okabe, my tone questioning.* "What?"

Okabe: *I study her face, searching for any signs of distress.* "Are you upset?"

Kurisu: *I look away, my lips pressed in a thin line.* "...Yeah."

Okabe: *I can tell she's upset because I dismissed her right after she finished the Time Leap Machine. I know she'll feel relieved later, but only after she has time to fully consider its implications.* "I came from five hours in the future."

Okabe: *I flinch slightly as Kurisu spears me with a piercing glare.*

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, my voice sharp.* "Is that supposed to be funny?"

Okabe: *Her narrowed eyes make me believe that looks can kill.* "D-don’t glare like that! This isn’t right! You’re supposed to believe me!"

Kurisu: *I throw my hands up in exasperation.* "What made you think I’d believe something like that!?"

Okabe: *I raise my voice, frustration seeping into my tone.* "You told me so! Five hours from now, okay!?"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, disbelief evident in my voice.* "Don’t be ridiculous. I would never make such a baseless projection."

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, wishing I could have a word with the future Kurisu. If this is how she's going to be, then I have no choice but to quote her word for word.* "When I told you about my time leap, you said, ’I took it as proof that my theories were right. I didn’t doubt it was true for a second.’ ’Don’t forget. It was my mad skillz that turned the PhoneWave into a time leap machine.’"

Kurisu: *I grimace, my cheeks flushing slightly.* "I don’t talk like that!"

Okabe: *I smirk, watching her reaction closely.* "What you want most right now is your own fork!"

Kurisu: "Wha--" *My face suddenly turns red as I stutter, taken aback by his words.*

Okabe: *I chuckle, pleased with her reaction.* "You already have your own spoon, apparently."

Kurisu: *I groan, burying my face in my hands.* "S-she said that? I’m gonna kill myself five hours from now..."

Okabe: *I can see the shock on her face, but I’m pretty sure she believes me now.*

Kurisu: *I look at Okabe, my voice softening.* "It feels like someone peeked into my heart. And that someone is Okabe, of all people."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, slightly taken aback by her words.* "What does she think I’m going to do?"

Kurisu: *I sigh, leaning back in my chair.* "But I think I believe you. Tell me the details."

Okabe: *I explain everything to Kurisu again, thankful that my thoughts are more organized this time around.*

Kurisu: *I nod, my gaze serious.* "I see... If what you say is true, then we have a serious problem."

Okabe: *I glance at the clock, feeling the weight of the impending danger.* "There are five hours until Mayuri’s death. We need to come up with a plan before then."

Kurisu: *I start to pace, deep in thought.* "Future me said that the chronology protection conjecture holds, but I don’t think that’s quite right. That conjecture says that according to quantum theory, time travel is impossible due to the danger of disrupting causality. But when you time leap, there’s no chance of a time paradox occurring."

Okabe: *I nod, realizing that two of me don’t exist at the same time, and I can’t bring anything with me to the past. All that changes are the memories stored in my temporal lobe. So at the very least, time leaping can’t cause a Grandfather Paradox.* "So I was right. The universe itself is censoring me, correcting any changes I try to make."
