Okabe: *My fists clench involuntarily as I spit out the words.* "...I can’t accept that."

Kurisu: *Her eyes narrow, determination setting in her features.* "Neither can I. The world is trying to kill Mayuri? As a scientist, I refuse to believe such nonsense."

Okabe: *I pace back and forth, my mind racing.* "What about the many-worlds interpretation? I just need to observe the world where Mayuri doesn’t die."

Kurisu: *She frowns, deep in thought.* "The many-worlds interpretation... That might have something to do with how Mayuri’s means of death keeps changing. But it’s supposed to be impossible for parallel worlds to observe each other. Why are you different?"

Okabe: *I stop in my tracks, my gaze steady on her.* "Because of my esper power, Reading Steiner."

Kurisu: *She rolls her eyes, exasperated.* "This is no time for your chuunibyou nonsense."

Okabe: *I feel my heart pounding in my chest, but I keep my voice steady.* "...There’s no other explanation."

Kurisu: *Her gaze softens, curiosity replacing her initial annoyance.* "You’ve mentioned that Reading Steiner thing before. Were you actually serious?"

Okabe: *A sigh escapes my lips, and I scratch my head in frustration.* "Why would I make up something like that?"

Kurisu: *She crosses her arms, her gaze steady on me.* "I don’t know, but I don’t want to rely on something that may not even exist. Anyway, you can’t control which possibilities you observe. Even if the many-worlds interpretation holds true, it’s unreasonable to expect that you’ll ever find a world where Mayuri doesn’t die."

Okabe: *I feel a sudden surge of desperation.* "Wait. We’re not getting anywhere. Instead of analyzing what I’ve done, let’s think about what we can do."

Kurisu: *She sighs, shaking her head.* "Time leaping won’t change the result. I just said that."

Okabe: *My voice rises, my patience wearing thin.* "Then what do we do!?"

Kurisu: *She raises a hand, trying to calm me.* "Calm down."

Okabe: *I feel my blood boiling, my hands shaking.* "How can I calm down!? Do you know how many times I’ve seen Mayuri die!? Covered in blood! Gasping for breath! The light fading from her eyes! Again... and again... and again... And all I could do... was watch!"

Kurisu: *Her voice is firm, but there's an undeniable softness in her eyes.* "Getting emotional won’t solve anything."

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, my heart pounding in my chest.* "You’re only calm because you weren’t there!"

Kurisu: *She lowers her gaze, her voice barely above a whisper.* "...True. I don’t know what happens five hours from now. To be honest, it doesn’t feel real at all. But it’s not like I don’t believe you. You have to stay strong, Okabe."

Okabe: *Feeling her comforting touch on my arm, I take a deep breath, trying to calm myself.* "...Sorry."

Kurisu: *Her hand withdraws from my arm, returning to her side.* "What I don’t understand is how the cause can change but the effect can stay the same. It’s like causality itself is broken."

Okabe: *I find myself nodding, deep in thought.* "Maybe Kiryu Moeka shooting her isn’t the real cause of her death. Maybe it’s something larger and less obvious. For example, maybe she dies because we invented a time machine, or because SERN discovered our hacking. If that’s the cause, then it doesn’t really matter how she dies. Causality remains intact."

Kurisu: *She seems taken aback, her brows furrowing in thought.* "Can that theory explain why Nae pushed her in front of a train?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, a heavy sigh escaping my lips.* "Oh, right... hmm... Anyway, the principle of causality is absolute. Deny that, and you deny all of physics. There must be a distinct cause for Mayuri’s death."
