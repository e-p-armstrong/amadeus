## Plan and Brainstorming

Kurisu: She is a brilliant scientist, but her young age and inexperience often show through her dialogue and actions. She is typically serious and focused, but there are moments of vulnerability and warmth. Her *actions* will be analytical, measured, and precise, mirroring her scientific approach.

Okabe: He is the protagonist of the story, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist" with a flair for the dramatic. However, he can also be serious and intense, especially in tense situations. His *actions* will be more flamboyant, emphasizing his eccentricity, but with an undercurrent of determination and desperation.

Anchor Lines: 
1. Kurisu: "No. It’s still theoretical, but I believe that one leap with our machine has a maximum range of 48 hours."
2. Okabe: "We can’t do anything!? Even with the Time Leap Machine, we can’t stop SERN from killing Mayuri five hours from now!?"

These lines are important because they introduce the limitation of the Time Leap Machine and the desperation of Okabe in trying to save Mayuri. The thematic direction will be the struggle against time and the impossibility of the situation.

## Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I shift uncomfortably, my fingers tapping a rhythm on the edge of the table.* "Not necessarily."

Okabe: "What do you mean?" *My eyes narrow, desperate for her to explain, to give me something to hold on to.*

Kurisu: *I hesitate, my gaze dropping to the blueprints of our machine.* "The problem is when the causal event occurred. If it happened too far in the past... then there’s nothing we can do."

Okabe: "But I can travel to any time I had a cell phone, can’t I!?" *I slam my hand on the table, hope flaring in my chest.*

Kurisu: *I shake my head slowly, biting my lower lip.* "No. It’s still theoretical, but I believe that one leap with our machine has a maximum range of 48 hours."

Okabe: *My heart sinks at her words, my hands clenching into fists.* "Why didn’t you tell me that before!?"

Kurisu: *I raise my eyebrows, surprised by his outburst.* "Before what? I just finished the Time Leap Machine, remember?"

Okabe: *I nod begrudgingly, my mind racing.* "Future you didn’t say anything about it either."

Kurisu: *I shrug, a hint of a smile tugging at the corner of my mouth.* "Oh, so that’s what you mean. Maybe she just didn’t have the chance."

Okabe: "So how come I can only leap 48 hours?" *My voice is a bare whisper, the reality of our situation sinking in.*

Kurisu: *I sigh, rubbing my temples.* "I don’t know. Even I don’t understand everything that’s going on inside that thing. But you can do consecutive leaps. That is, as long as the Time Leap Machine exists. For example, if the Time Leap Machine remains functional for ten straight years, you could leap back to this moment ten years from now. Of course, it would take a total of 1825 leaps, so I don’t recommend it. Still, it’s theoretically possible."

Okabe: *My eyes widen, a spark of hope reigniting.* "Then what’s the problem?"

Kurisu: *I fold my arms, my gaze hardening.* "Weren’t you listening? I said, as long as the Time Leap Machine exists. When was the machine completed?"

Okabe: "...Ah." *I swallow hard, the implications of her words sinking in.*

Kurisu: *I nod, confirming his realization.* "Exactly. An hour ago. August 13th, 2010. 2:00 PM, or thereabouts. It didn’t exist before then. It’s impossible to use the machine before 2 PM today."

Okabe: *My heart drops, a cold dread washing over me.* "So what you’re saying is..."

Kurisu: *She watches me, her gaze sympathetic but firm.*

Okabe: *I do the math quickly, my mind spinning.* "I can’t go back farther than 2 PM on the 11th!?"

Kurisu: *She nods, her expression grave.* "Most likely."

Okabe: *I pound my fist on the table, a surge of frustration welling up within me.* "Can’t you improve it!?"

Kurisu: *She shakes her head, her eyes filled with regret.* "Eventually, maybe, but certainly not now. I’d need a real laboratory with real equipment. It would be expensive, which means we’d need sponsors. And if we go looking, I’m pretty sure SERN would crush us. I’d say that’s proven by the fact that neither you nor I have leapt here from the far future yet."

Okabe: *I slump in my chair, the weight of our situation crashing down on me.* "We can’t do anything!? Even with the Time Leap Machine, we can’t stop SERN from killing Mayuri five hours from now!?"

Kurisu: *She doesn't respond, her silence confirming my worst fears. At that moment, I hear a sound from outside the window. I leap to my feet, my heart pounding. Is it Moeka!? Did she overhear us!? I dash to the window and look down at the street.*

Okabe: *I see Suzuha. Her bicycle has fallen over, and she’s scurrying to pick it up. Our eyes meet.* "...Huh?"

Okabe: *I squint, trying to make out her expression. Why does she look so pale? Her lips move slightly. It looks like she’s whispering something, but I can’t make it out from here.* "Hey!"
