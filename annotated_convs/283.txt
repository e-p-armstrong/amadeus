Okabe: *As I watch Suzuha disappear into the crowd, a sense of urgency grips me. I know chasing her on foot is nearly impossible, but I can't shake off the feeling that something is amiss.* "Suzuha! I need to talk to you!"

Suzuha: *She turns around, her eyes filled with regret and sorrow.* "...I’m sorry. It’s all my fault."

Okabe: *I can feel my heart sinking at her words, my mind racing to comprehend her sudden departure.* "...What?"

Suzuha: *She takes a deep breath, her voice barely a whisper.* "All because I acted like a spoiled child. This time, I’m going. Bye."

Okabe: *I reach out to her, my voice echoing through the bustling street.* "Hey! Suzuha! Wait!"

Okabe: *A sense of deja vu washes over me as I lose sight of Suzuha once again, just like the time when she failed to meet her father. My eyes dart around the sea of people, searching for a glimpse of her or her bike. But there's no trace of her, and a sudden chill runs down my spine as I remember the danger of Rounders lurking in Akiba. As I approach the station’s main exit, a gasp from the crowd around me pulls me out of my thoughts. I follow their gaze up to the sky, or rather, the satellite on the roof of Radi-Kan.*

Okabe: *The sight of the blinking lights leaves me dumbfounded.* "Wha..."

Okabe: *A sudden realization hits me. Could it be...?* "Suzuha? Or could it be Moeka!?"
