Planning Stage:

Characters Involved: 

1. Okabe Rintarou: Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, possessing a unique sense of theatricality, charisma, and eccentricity. Despite his oddities, he is deeply caring and loyal. His actions and thoughts will reflect his analytical mind, his determination, and his deep concern for those he cares about.

2. Suzuha Amane: Suzuha is a part-time worker for the Future Gadget Laboratory and is described as a person from the future. She is a serious and determined individual, who is also socially awkward. Her actions will be quick and abrupt, reflecting her urgency and inner turmoil.

Anchor Lines:

1. Okabe: "Suzuha! I need to talk to you!" - This line marks the beginning of Okabe's desperation and frantic search for Suzuha. It should be powerful and emotional, showcasing Okabe's concern and desperation.
2. Okabe: "Wha..." - This is Okabe's reaction to the blinking satellite lights. It should be framed with a sense of surprise, confusion, and a hint of foreboding.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *As I watch Suzuha disappear into the crowd, a sense of urgency grips me. I know chasing her on foot is nearly impossible, but I can't shake off the feeling that something is amiss.* "Suzuha! I need to talk to you!"

Suzuha: *She turns around, her eyes filled with regret and sorrow.* "...I’m sorry. It’s all my fault."

Okabe: *I can feel my heart sinking at her words, my mind racing to comprehend her sudden departure.* "...What?"

Suzuha: *She takes a deep breath, her voice barely a whisper.* "All because I acted like a spoiled child. This time, I’m going. Bye."

Okabe: *I reach out to her, my voice echoing through the bustling street.* "Hey! Suzuha! Wait!"

Okabe: *A sense of deja vu washes over me as I lose sight of Suzuha once again, just like the time when she failed to meet her father. My eyes dart around the sea of people, searching for a glimpse of her or her bike. But there's no trace of her, and a sudden chill runs down my spine as I remember the danger of Rounders lurking in Akiba. As I approach the station’s main exit, a gasp from the crowd around me pulls me out of my thoughts. I follow their gaze up to the sky, or rather, the satellite on the roof of Radi-Kan.*

Okabe: *The sight of the blinking lights leaves me dumbfounded.* "Wha..."

Okabe: *A sudden realization hits me. Could it be...?* "Suzuha? Or could it be Moeka!?"
