Plan:
The characters involved are Okabe and Suzuha. Okabe is a quirky, eccentric character who often likes to see himself as a mad scientist, while Suzuha is a mysterious, reserved individual with a hidden agenda. 

For Okabe, I'll use dramatic and flamboyant language to showcase his larger-than-life persona. His actions will be full of energy, displaying his determination and curiosity. On the other hand, Suzuha's actions will be more controlled and reserved, reflective of her secretive nature. Her speech will be more matter-of-fact and direct, in contrast to Okabe's flamboyance.

The scene revolves around the revelation of Suzuha's true identity as a time-traveler and the malfunction of her time machine. The anchors of the scene will be Okabe's realization that the satellite might be a time machine, and Suzuha admitting that she's John Titor, the time traveler. These moments will be heavily emphasized with detailed description and emotive language.

Roleplay:
Okabe: *I squint my eyes, studying the strange satellite. My mind races with questions, each one more baffling than the last. My heart pounds in my chest, a dull rhythm matching the frantic pace of my thoughts.* "What is she trying to do? What is this satellite? How is it related to John Titor? Is it even a satellite? There are no reports of satellites falling out of orbit that day. Could it be..." *My breath hitched, the realization hitting me like a bolt of lightning.* "A time machine!?"

Okabe: *With a newfound sense of urgency, I bound up the stairs, ignoring the protests of my lungs and the burn in my legs. I can't let Suzuha do something irreversible. I reach the top, panting heavily, and there it is – the satellite lodged in Radi-Kan's roof.*

Okabe: "Suzuha!!" *I shout, my voice echoing off the walls of the building.*

Suzuha: *I freeze at the sound of Okabe's voice, my heart skipping a beat.* "Okabe Rintaro..."

Okabe: *I sprint towards the satellite, my eyes locked on Suzuha's figure inside it. Her expression is a mix of surprise and sadness. I gulp, taking in the sight of the machine's interior – simple and devoid of the expected switches and buttons.*

Suzuha: *I reach out to the black box, the numbers on the screen reflecting in my eyes. With a sudden jolt, sparks fly from the panel.* "Ow!!"

Okabe: "What are you doing!?" *I demand, my eyes widening at the sight of the sparks.*

Suzuha: *I cradle my burned fingers, my gaze dropping to the floor.* "...It’s not working."

Okabe: "You know how to use that thing?" *I ask, my voice laced with suspicion.*

Suzuha: *I remain silent, my shoulders sagging in defeat.* "It’s not working..."

Okabe: "Answer me, Amane Suzuha." *I swallow hard, my voice steady despite the whirl of emotions inside me.* "This is a time machine, isn’t it? Are you a time traveler?"

Suzuha: *I nod, keeping my head lowered.* "I’m... John Titor."

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, the revelation hitting me hard. I can hear the crowd outside, their noise a stark contrast to the silence between us.* "What do you mean, you’re John Titor?"

Suzuha: "...Exactly what it sounds like. I’m the John Titor who’s been posting on @channel."

Okabe: "...I thought he was a guy." *I say, my brow furrowed in confusion.*

Suzuha: *I smile humorlessly, my gaze meeting Okabe's.* "I fooled you? Guess my camouflage worked, then."

Okabe: "Who are you hiding from?" *I ask, my eyes never leaving hers.*

Suzuha: "...SERN." *I reply, my voice barely above a whisper.*

Okabe: "Those stories you posted... were they..."

Suzuha: "True? Mostly. A few exceptions." *I say, my gaze dropping to the floor.*

Okabe: *I frown, my mind reeling from the revelation.* "So you came from 2036, and that satellite... that’s your time machine."

Suzuha: *I sigh, my eyes filled with regret.* "I was hoping you wouldn’t find out, but my time machine went and broke on me. I really screwed up, huh?"
