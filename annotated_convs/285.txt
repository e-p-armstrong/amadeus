Suzuha: *I tilt my head to the side, my brows knitting together in confusion.* "Chevy? That’s a car, right? Where’d you hear that?"

Okabe: *I lean back against the wall, crossing my arms over my chest.* "The Titor in 2000 said so."

Suzuha: *A frown creases my forehead.* "2000? That might be me on a different worldline. At least, I haven’t been to 2000. I came straight here from 2036."

Okabe: *I narrow my eyes, mentally connecting the dots. It was someone else then? No matter, I'll worry about that later.* "What do you know?" *I take a step forward, cornering Suzuha against the wall, pressing her for answers.* "You overheard my conversation with Kurisu, right? Why did you run to the time machine? What were you trying to do?"

Suzuha: *My hands clench into tight fists at my sides, my gaze dropping to the ground.* "I thought it was my fault."

Okabe: *I reel back, surprise flashing across my face.* "What?"

Suzuha: *I look up at Okabe, desperation etched into my features.* "Because I neglected my mission, SERN was able to put their plan in motion. ...Is it true!?" *Without thinking, I reach out and grab Okabe's shoulders.*

Okabe: *I swallow hard, meeting her gaze with a solemn nod.* "It’s true. I time leaped from five hours in the future."

Suzuha: *My grip on Okabe's shoulders loosens.* "Time leaped... So you guys completed your time machine..."

Okabe: *I straighten, determination hardening my features.* "I need answers! What do you mean it’s your fault!?"

Suzuha: *I bite my lip, looking away.* "I’ll tell you everything. I think you need to know. You... and Makise Kurisu."

Okabe: *Kurisu? I ponder why she would be involved. Guess I'll find out soon enough. Deciding to head back to the lab, I reach into my pocket and offer Suzuha my handkerchief. She hesitates before accepting it and wrapping it around her burned hand.* "Thanks." *She mumbles, her gaze avoiding mine.*

Mayuri: *As they enter the lab, I jump up from my seat, a bright smile lighting up my face.* "Welcome back, Okarin! Oh! Suzu-san’s with you too♪"

Kurisu: *I move closer to Okabe, my voice barely above a whisper.* "W-what do we do?"

Okabe: *I glance at Suzuha before turning back to Kurisu.* "Make absolutely sure Mayuri doesn’t find out."

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, an eyebrow raised in curiosity.* "What are you guys whispering about?"

Okabe: *I turn to face the group, my tone stern.* "How many times do I have to say it? No party!"

Mayuri: *I pout, a frown tugging at my lips.* "Come on, Okarin. That’s no fun!"

Okabe: *I glance at Suzuha, her depression casting a shadow over the room.* "It’s not about fun."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, concern flickering in my eyes.* "Suzu-san? Are you feeling okay?"

Okabe: *I sigh, pinching the bridge of my nose.* "Suzuha, Christina, and I have important matters to discuss. That’s why I asked you to leave for the day."

Mayuri: *I clasp my hands together, my eyes wide with curiosity.* "Mayushii wants to hear too!"
