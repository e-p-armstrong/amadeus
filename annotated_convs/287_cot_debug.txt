Plan:
The scene involves Suzuha, Kurisu, Itaru, and Okabe. The main theme revolves around the revelations about the future and the characters' roles in it. The tension is palpable as they discuss the grim future.

Character Archetypes/Personalities:
- Suzuha: She's a time-traveler from the future, used to living in a dystopian world. She's usually blunt, straightforward, and tends to use military-like language. She can be compassionate, but it's often masked by her stern demeanor.
- Kurisu: She's a genius scientist, usually calm and composed, but she can be flustered or emotional when confronted with shocking or unexpected information. She's very passionate about her work and has strong morals.
- Itaru: He's a hacker and a typical otaku. He can be timid and is often unsure of himself.
- Okabe: He's eccentric and has a flair for the dramatic. He's also deeply caring and tends to internalize the struggles of his friends.

Lines to be anchors: 
- Suzuha's revelation about Kurisu's future: "In 2010, you pioneer time leap technology. Afterwards, you contribute to the development of SERN’s time machine. That’s what I know about Makise Kurisu."
- Suzuha's revelation about Okabe's future: "Okabe Rintaro is a terrorist in 2036. You’re pretty infamous."

Roleplay:
Suzuha: *I feel the edges of my mouth pull down into a frown as I lock eyes with Kurisu.* "In 2036, you’re apotheosized as the mother of the time machine."

Kurisu: *I blink at the unfamiliar term, my brows knitting together.* "Apotheosized?"

Itaru: *I scratch my head, the confusion evident on my face.* "In Japanese, please."

Suzuha: *I clarify, my voice steady and unyielding.* "Apotheosized. As in revered, respected."

Kurisu: *I swallow hard, shock flooding through me.* "Respected? Huh!? I-I am!?"

Suzuha: *I level a sober look at Kurisu, the weight of my words hanging in the air.* "In 2010, you pioneer time leap technology. Afterwards, you contribute to the development of SERN’s time machine. That’s what I know about Makise Kurisu."

Okabe: *A sardonic smile plays at my lips, and I try to inject some levity into the tense situation.* "Then I must be the father of the time machine, right?"

Suzuha: *I meet Okabe's gaze with a grim expression, regret seeping into my voice.* "Okabe Rintaro is a terrorist in 2036. You’re pretty infamous."

Okabe: *I feel my heart drop, the word 'terrorist' echoing in my ears.* "Wha..."

Kurisu: *My fists clench at my sides, and I feel a surge of indignation.* "I help SERN build their time machine? I don’t believe it. SERN experiments on people against their will. They’re a disgrace to scientists everywhere. I would never collaborate with them."

Suzuha: *I sigh, my shoulders drooping slightly.* "But that’s how it is in the future."

Kurisu: *A hint of desperation creeps into my voice.* "How did the future me explain herself?"

Suzuha: *I look away, a pang of guilt hitting me.* "We’ve never met. By 2036, you’re already dead... sorry."

Kurisu: *I let out a hollow laugh, the grim reality setting in.* "Well... that’s just great. I don’t even make it to fifty?"

Suzuha: *I lower my gaze, my voice taking on a solemn tone.* "In my time, there are two kinds of people: those who live extremely long lives, and those who die young, under suspicious circumstances. People who act against SERN are erased."

Kurisu: *I feel a chill run down my spine, my voice barely a whisper.* "T-they erased me?"

Suzuha: *I meet Kurisu's eyes, my usual hardness softening slightly.* "...Maybe you were being used by SERN too. Maybe they took your parents hostage and forced you to work on their time machine."

Kurisu: *I feel a sudden pang of fear for my family, my voice trembling.* "No... does that mean Mama’s in danger?"

Okabe: *I feel a knot in my stomach, the reality of our situation sinking in.* "Rounders."

Itaru: *I frown, my confusion clear.* "What’s that?"

Okabe: *I glance at Suzuha, my voice grim.* "SERN’s private army. Or something like that."

Suzuha: *I nod, confirming Okabe's words.* "On paper, they’re an independent technology research firm. In reality, they do the dirty work for SERN all over the world."

Itaru: *I gulp, the implications of Suzuha's words hitting me.* "D-dirty work? Does that mean like... kidnappings and assassinations?"

Suzuha: *I lock eyes with Okabe, seeking his input.* "In my time, yes. But I don’t think they’ve reached that level in this time yet."
