Kurisu: *I shake my head, my eyes scanning over the room filled with anxious faces.* "You guys are hopeless. Better do something quick."

Suzuha: *I glance around, confusion etched on my face.* "Umm, I don’t know what you guys are talking about..."

Kurisu: *I dismiss the confusion with a wave of my hand.* "Just ignore them."

Okabe: *A sudden realization hits me, a chilling understanding that sends a shiver down my spine.* So the reason I can’t save Mayuri... is that her death is the event upon which this attractor field converges? But that means... That means the world really is killing Mayuri.

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, my fingers tapping on the armrest.* "But then, isn’t it impossible to change the future? It always converges in the end, right? No matter what you do, the result is the same."

Okabe: *The weight of Itaru's words sinks in, and I feel a cold dread settle in my stomach.* That’s right. That’s why Mayuri dies no matter how many times I leap.

Suzuha: *I stand straight, my gaze firm.* "We have to escape Attractor Field Alpha."

Okabe: *I blink, caught off guard.* "Escape?"

Suzuha: *I nod, my expression resolute.* "In other words, we’re going to jump to a worldline in Attractor Field Beta."

Kurisu: *I frown, my mind already racing with questions.* "I thought attractor fields couldn’t interact."

Suzuha: "Attractor fields are normally separate, but if we go to the instant they diverge..."

Kurisu: *I tap my fingers against my chin, deep in thought.* "The instant they diverge... is that now?"

Suzuha: "I was taught that a major divergence occurs in 2010. This year, an earth-shattering event causes divergence at the attractor field level. The last time such a divergence occurred was in the year 2000, and before that, in 1991."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my eyes wide with curiosity.* "Umm, what happened those years?"

Suzuha: "Events that changed the face of the world."

Mayuri: *I blink, surprised.* "Huh?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, my mind already racing with possibilities.* "1991 was the collapse of the Soviet Union, right? But what happened in 2000? 2001 had the 9/11 attacks..."

Suzuha: "The Year 2000 Problem."

Itaru: *I snort, shaking my head.* "Y2K? But that was just hype. Nothing happened."

Suzuha: "That’s because the Alpha worldline we’re on represents a world where Y2K didn’t occur."

Okabe: *My mind reels with the implications.* So in other words, there are worlds where it did occur?

Suzuha: "And that brings us to 2010."

Mayuri: *I look up, my eyes shining with anticipation.* "Did something big happen this year?"

Suzuha: *I glance towards the development room, a knowing smile on my face.* "What else could it be... But the creation of humanity’s first time machine?"

Mayuri: *I gasp, clapping my hands together in delight.* "Oh yeah! Wow!"

Kurisu: *I cut through the excitement with a sharp question.* "One more question."

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu keeps plowing ahead, her determination is as admirable as it is relentless.* I guess that’s what makes her a scientist.

Kurisu: *I focus on Suzuha, my gaze intense.* "These worldlines aren’t parallel worlds, are they?"

Suzuha: "No. Ultimately, they’re just possibilities that exist simultaneously."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, my brow furrowing in thought.* "Then how do you observe the differences between worldlines? Wouldn’t you need a god’s eye view to do that?"

Suzuha: "Normally. However..."

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat as Suzuha looks at me.* ...Don’t tell me!

Okabe: *My eyes widen in realization.* "Reading Steiner!?"

Suzuha: *I nod at Okabe, a hint of admiration in my eyes.* "Is that what you call it? Okabe Rintaro, you have the power to observe changes across worldlines. Correct?"

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Yeah."

Suzuha: *I look at Okabe, my voice echoing with the weight of my words.* "That’s the key. Your power is the key to freeing the world from SERN’s rule. You have the power of a god."

Okabe: *I blink, the gravity of Suzuha's words sinking in.* "My power..."

Suzuha: "If you escape Attractor Field Alpha and reach a Beta worldline... then the result will change."

Okabe: *A shiver of excitement runs down my spine, a spark of hope igniting in the darkness.* I feel a shiver of excitement.

Okabe: *My voice barely a whisper, my heart pounding with hope and fear.* "So there’s hope?"
