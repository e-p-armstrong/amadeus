Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, my fingers drumming on the table as I ponder our situation.* "I thought we had a glimmer of hope..."

Itaru: *I glance around the room, my eyes resting on the broken time machine.* "I think we should try to fix it."

Mayuri: *I brighten at Daru's suggestion, clasping my hands together in excitement.* "Yeah! It’s a time machine, so we have plenty of time, right?"

Okabe: *I keep quiet, my gaze distant. The harsh reality of our situation weighs heavily on me.* "Kurisu, Suzuha, and I say nothing. We know. In less than two hours, Mayuri will die."

Okabe: *I shake myself out of my thoughts, forcing a smile onto my face.* "You’re all hungry, aren’t you? You should be."

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, surprised by the sudden change in topic.* "What’s this all of a sudden?"

Mayuri: *I nod eagerly, my stomach rumbling at the mention of food.* "Mayushii’s hungry!"

Okabe: *I reach into my wallet, pulling out a 10,000 yen bill and holding it out to Mayuri and Daru.* "Mayuri, Daru. I leave the shopping to you. We can come up with a plan while we eat."

Mayuri: *I gasp at the sight of the money, my eyes sparkling with excitement.* "Wow, Okarin! What are we going to do with all this money?"

Okabe: *I wave the bill in front of them, a determined look in my eyes.* "Buy food. Lots of food. Use it all!"

Itaru: *I laugh, shaking my head in disbelief.* "You just calmly hand over a 10, 000 yen bill... wow, Okarin, you make it look easy! That’s why we love you! That’s why we admire you!"

Okabe: *I watch as Mayuri and Daru leave in high spirits, a small smile tugging at my lips.* "I knew the 10,000 yen bill would work."

Okabe: *I turn my attention to the two remaining in the room, my gaze serious.* "Christina. Titor."

Suzuha: *I raise an eyebrow, confused by the sudden nickname.* "Titor? Is that me?"

Okabe: *I nod, leaning forward in my chair.* "Who else?"

Suzuha: *I frown, trying to understand his sudden change in demeanor.* "Why are you calling me that now?"

Okabe: *I shrug, a hint of a smirk on my lips.* "Because you’re the one behind Titor’s mask."

Suzuha: *I huff, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Well, yeah, but..."

Kurisu: *I interject, trying to defuse the situation.* "Just give up. Okabe rarely calls anyone by their name."

Suzuha: *I sigh, shaking my head in resignation.* "Oh yeah. He always calls me ’Part-Time Warrior’ for some reason."

Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, my gaze focused on the two of them.* "Listen, you two. I’m going to leap to 2 PM on the 11th. After Titor explains herself again, we’ll start repairs on the time machine. Our goal is to have it working by this time today."

Kurisu: *I frown, considering his words.* "Is that the best plan?"

Okabe: *I nod, my determination unwavering.* "It’s better than trying to fix it when we only have two hours left. If it doesn’t work, I’ll just keep repeating the same two days."

Suzuha: *I bow my head, guilt washing over me.* "...I’m sorry."

Okabe: *I stare at Suzuha, my voice firm and resolute.* "Titor. We’re counting on you to get us an IBN 5100. Never forget. I’m not doing this for you, and I’m not doing it for the future. My mission is to save Mayuri. Call me self-righteous if you want. However... I’m doing this my way."

Okabe: *I look between Kurisu and Suzuha, meeting their gazes.* "Kurisu and Suzuha give an encouraging nod in agreement."

Okabe: *I clench my fists, a determined glint in my eyes.* "Good. Then let’s begin."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, a teasing smile on my lips.* "You’re not going to name the operation?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, my tone serious.* "Who cares about that? This isn’t a game. Mayuri’s life hangs in the balance."

Kurisu: *I chuckle, trying to lighten the mood.* "You couldn’t find a good Norse mythology-themed name?"

Suzuha: *I tilt my head in confusion.* "Why Norse mythology?"

Kurisu: *I shrug, a playful grin on my face.* "I don’t think there’s a deep meaning behind it. Chuunibyou patients just love Germanic names for some reason."
