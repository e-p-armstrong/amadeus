Kurisu: *I cross my arms, a hint of a smirk tugging at the corner of my lips.* "So there’s still chuunibyou in 2036..."

Okabe: *My fingers clench around my phone, a sharp rebuke escaping my lips.* "Cut the chatter!"

Okabe: *I feel the weight of Mayuri’s life hanging in the balance. There’s no time for this nonsense. As Kurisu sets up the Time Leap Machine, and Suzuha goes to turn on the 42-inch CRT, I can't help but glance at the clock, the seconds ticking away far too quickly. Well before Mayuri returns, I make my decision. I leap.*

Okabe: *When I come to, I’m standing with my phone in hand, my heart pounding in my chest. I check the date and time on my phone screen, feeling a momentary relief. August 11th, 2:21 PM. Alright. Now I have two more days. I let out a breath I didn't realize I had been holding.*

Itaru: *I push myself up from my chair, a spark of excitement lighting up my eyes.* "Let’s go take a look!"

Okabe: *I glance at Daru, noticing his unusually enthusiastic demeanor. I guess Suzuha’s talk of attractor fields and divergence and correcting history’s mistakes got his blood pumping.*

Mayuri: *I step forward, my voice wavering slightly as I stop everyone from leaving the lab.* "H-hold on, everyone!"

Mayuri: *I wring my hands together nervously, my gaze flickering between the others.* "Um, guys? Aren’t we forgetting something?"

Itaru: *I tilt my head, a puzzled expression on my face.* "Like what?"

Mayuri: *I bite my lip, gathering my courage before blurting out,* "What about Suzu-san’s dad?"

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback. Oh, right. I thought Suzuha was lying about that. But when I turn to her, she looks away.*

Suzuha: *I avert my gaze, my voice barely above a whisper.* "...That doesn’t matter now, does it?"

Mayuri: *I insist, my voice steady and determined.* "It does too! I mean, it’ll take time to fix the time machine, won’t it? We should help Suzu-san find her dad in the meantime! Right?"

Okabe: *I hesitate, unsure of how to respond.* "But..."

Mayuri: *I puff out my cheeks, giving Okabe a stern look.* "Don’t be like that, Okarin! You have to keep your promise."

Okabe: *I blink, trying to recall. What promise?*

Mayuri: *I remind him gently, my voice soft and sincere.* "We promised, remember? We said we’d all look for Suzu-san’s dad."

Okabe: *I sigh, the memory flooding back. That’s right... We convinced her to stay by promising to help look for her father. My fingers tighten around my phone as I finally acknowledge.* "Yeah... I remember."

Mayuri: *I smile, a hopeful glint in my eyes.* "I know Suzu-san has a mission and stuff, but I think she also came because she really wanted to meet her dad. Mayushii wants to make that happen!"

Okabe: *If Mayuri feels that strongly about it, there’s no way I can refuse.*

Suzuha: *I blink back tears, a soft smile playing on my lips.* "Shiina Mayuri... you’re such a nice girl..."

Suzuha: *I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper as I admit,* "...You’re right. I thought I could find him if I came to this town. I know that he was in Akihabara in 2010."
