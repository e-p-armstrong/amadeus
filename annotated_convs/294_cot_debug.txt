Planning:

1. Characters involved: Suzuha, Okabe, Mayuri, Itaru, Kurisu.
2. Character archetypes/personalities:
   - Suzuha: A serious and determined time traveller, she is also quite emotional about her father.
   - Okabe: The eccentric, self-proclaimed mad scientist who is also quite perceptive and kindhearted.
   - Mayuri: Okabe's caring and cheerful childhood friend, often serving as the emotional support of the group.
   - Itaru: Okabe's best friend, a skilled hacker and a bit of a pervert.
   - Kurisu: A genius neuroscientist, she is logical, somewhat tsundere, but also has a soft spot for her friends.
3. Writing style/word choice for actions and thoughts:
   - Suzuha: Her actions will be written with a sense of urgency and determination. Her emotions about her father will be subtly revealed through her body language.
   - Okabe: His thoughts and actions will be written with a bit of drama and eccentricity, but also with a deep sense of responsibility and care for his friends.

   - Itaru: His actions will be focused on his tech-savvy skills and his dialogue will have a casual and friendly tone.
   - Kurisu: Her actions and dialogue will be written with a sense of logical reasoning and a subtle display of her concern for the group.
4. Anchor lines:
   - Suzuha: "I... don’t know his real name. Some daughter, huh?"
   - Suzuha: "Everyone... thank you. But I want to be clear that my mission to 1975 comes first. That was my dad’s final wish, after all. So if we still haven’t found him by the time repairs are complete, I think we should give up. Is that okay?"

Roleplay:

Suzuha: *I raise an eyebrow, a hint of a smile playing on my lips.* "Of course he is! At this age, he’s probably still young and cool."

Okabe: *I rub my chin thoughtfully.* "His name was Barrel Titor, right?"

Suzuha: *I nod, my expression serious again.* "Yeah, that’s right."

Mayuri: "Wow, a foreigner?" *I tilt my head, my eyes wide with curiosity.*

Suzuha: *I shake my head, correcting her gently.* "No, I’m pretty sure he’s Japanese. Barrel Titor is his codename in the Resistance. I don’t think he’s using it yet."

Okabe: *I mutter to myself, connecting the dots.* "So that’s why Suzuha called herself John Titor."

Suzuha: *I lower my gaze, my fingers clenching unconsciously.* "I... don’t know his real name. Some daughter, huh?" *My voice quivers for a moment, but I quickly force a bitter smile onto my face.*

Okabe: *I look at her, my heart sinking as I realize the weight of her words.* "Hearing that, I realize how hellish the world she came from must be."

Okabe: *I clear my throat, trying to steer the conversation away from the sensitive topic.* "What about your surname, Amane?"

Suzuha: "That was my mother’s maiden name." *I say it matter-of-factly, trying to keep my emotions in check.*

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, my brow furrowed in thought.* "So you have no leads?"

Suzuha: *I ponder for a moment, before a realization hits me.* "Leads... oh, there is one thing." *I clap my hands together and start patting my pockets. After a few seconds, I pull something out.*

Mayuri: "A pin?" *I lean forward to get a better look, my curiosity piqued.*

Okabe: *I glance at the object in Suzuha's hand.* "I’ve seen Suzuha fiddling with it before. It’s just a regular pin, the kind you stick on your hat or bag."

Mayuri: *I squint at the pin, my finger tracing the etching.* "There’s something written on it."

Okabe: *I read the engraving aloud.* "It reads OSHM***A 7010."

Suzuha: *I nod, holding the pin delicately.* "This belonged to my dad."

Kurisu: *I murmur, my eyes softening.* "A memento..."

Okabe: *I snap my fingers, turning to Itaru.* "Google it, Daru!"

Itaru: *I quickly start typing on my computer.* "Daru runs a search, but gets only incomprehensible foreign sites."

Suzuha: "He was here in Akihabara, so I think we can exclude the foreign sites." *I suggest, trying to narrow down the search.*

Itaru: "Okay, got it." *I adjust the search parameters, but even then, the results are irrelevant.*

Itaru: "Nothing!" *I exclaim in frustration, throwing my hands up.*

Mayuri: "But this has to be some kind of hint!" *I insist, my eyes pleading.*

Okabe: *I take a deep breath and, with Suzuha’s permission, take a picture of the pin.*

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my voice filled with determination.* "Okay, all in favor of helping Suzu-san find her dad?"

Okabe: *I sigh, knowing there’s no harm in letting Mayuri have her way.* "...No objections."

Mayuri: *I beam at him, my heart fluttering with gratitude.* "Thanks, Okarin♪ Ehehe!"

Okabe: *I watch as Daru and Kurisu also agree. It’s decided. We’ll help Suzuha find her father.*

Suzuha: *I bow my head, my voice choked with emotion.* "Everyone... thank you. But I want to be clear that my mission to 1975 comes first. That was my dad’s final wish, after all. So if we still haven’t found him by the time repairs are complete, I think we should give up. Is that okay?"

Mayuri: *I bite my lip, my heart sinking.* "Are you sure?"

Suzuha: *I nod, my expression resolute.* "If we still haven’t found him by then, it just wasn’t meant to be."

Okabe: *I let out a sigh of relief, appreciating Suzuha's pragmatism.*

Itaru: *I scratch my head, trying to figure out the next step.* "So where do we start?"

Okabe: *I point at the pin, my voice firm.* "The pin is our only hint. We’ll hit every store in Akiba that sells things like this. Maybe someone will know where it came from."
