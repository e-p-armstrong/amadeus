Planning:

1. Okabe: The protagonist and the one who often takes the lead. He is dramatic, flamboyant, and has a flair for the theatrical. He has a deep sense of responsibility and is struggling with the weight of Mayuri's impending death. His *actions* and *thoughts* will be filled with determination, urgency, and a hint of desperation.

2. Itaru: The "super hacker" of the group. He is often laid-back and humorous, but is also dedicated and capable. He is easily motivated by the promise of a date with Faris. His *actions* and *thoughts* will be casual, technical, and focused.

3. Suzuha: A time-traveler and the owner of the time machine. She is serious, determined, and practical. She has a vital role in this mission and her *actions* and *thoughts* will reflect her urgency and determination.

The anchor lines for this scene will be Okabe's "Daru. Super Hacka. Everything depends on your skills now..." and "You’re our only hope." These lines will be filled with heavy emotional weight and urgency, reflecting Okabe's desperation and the gravity of the situation.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I gaze around at the niche stores of Akiba, my eyes catching the strange and cool accessories on display.* "Akiba is full of niche stores where you can find strange and cool accessories."

Okabe: *I remember the struggle of sneaking into Radi-Kan in the daytime. The crowd isn't as thick as before, but the constant stream of pedestrian traffic makes it a challenge. It takes us about 30 minutes to infiltrate the place, with Kurisu back at the lab, focused on the Time Leap Machine.* *My mind wanders to Mayuri, who's off somewhere, looking for Suzuha's father.* "How does it look?"

Okabe: *I call out to Daru, who's buried deep within the flooded satellite — the time machine. Suzuha and I are on the lookout, watching for any sign of trouble. Daru emerges, drenched in sweat and panting heavily. We rush to pull him out. There's a risk of being spotted, but we have no choice.*

Itaru: *I wipe the sweat from my brow, gasping for breath.* "It’s so freaking hot in there. It’s worse than a sauna. Spend too much time in there and I’ll turn into Daru jerky. By the way, it’s not gonna fall or anything... right?"

Okabe: *I glance at the time machine, teetering dangerously on the ledge but held in place by the police's support wires.* "Can it be fixed?"

Itaru: *I shrug, uncertainty clouding my features.* "Well, I still don’t know for sure. But there is one thing I noticed just now. It’s built kind of like the PhoneWave."

Okabe: *My eyes light up at the possibility.* "That means there’s a chance, right!?"

Itaru: *I hold up my hands defensively.* "I said I’m not sure. I need to poke around some more."

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, steeling myself for the monumental request I'm about to make.* "Daru. Super Hacka. Everything depends on your skills now. You are the super hacka who will save the world. In 2036, people will worship you instead of Kurisu, the mother of the time machine."

Itaru: *I groan, rolling my eyes.* "It’s hacker! How many times do I have to tell you!?"

Okabe: *Ignoring his protest, I press on.* "Anyway, you have two days. Do whatever it takes, Daru."

Okabe: *I place my hand on Daru’s shoulder, looking him straight in the eye, trying to convey the weight of the situation.* "You’re our only hope."

Itaru: *I sigh, scratching my head.* "No promises, man. And why two days?"

Okabe: *I hesitate, unable to tell him the truth about Mayuri's fate.* "Well..."

Suzuha: *I step in, saving Okabe from having to answer.* "In two days, the weather conditions will be perfect for creating the ring singularity. If we miss that window, we won’t have another chance until next year."

Okabe: *I nod gratefully at Suzuha, relieved at her timely intervention.* "P-precisely!"

Itaru: "Fix it in two days? That’s just nuts."

Okabe: *I smirk, playing my trump card.* "But if you do, you’ll earn the right to a date with Faris."

Itaru: *I freeze, wide-eyed and speechless.* "...!?"

Okabe: *I lean in, pressing my advantage.* "Can you fix it?"

Itaru: *I gulp, a determined look in my eyes.* "No problem!"
