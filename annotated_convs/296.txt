Kurisu: *Emerging from the development room, I scan the faces of my companions.* "From the looks on your faces, I guess you didn’t find anything."

Okabe: *I rub my temples, feeling a headache coming on.* "Where’s Daru?"

Kurisu: *I glance towards the door, my brows knitted in concern.* "He hasn’t come back yet. It’s already dark, so maybe he went straight home?"

Okabe: *As I look around the dim room, I can't help but worry about Mayuri's progress in searching for Suzuha’s father.* "It’s too dark to work at Radi-Kan now. We can’t use lights, because that would be too conspicuous to the people below."

Suzuha: *I let out a sigh, crossing my arms over my chest.* "I feel bad. There’s no time for this..."

Okabe: *I turn to Suzuha, my gaze stern.* "It’s not for you. We’re doing it to save Mayuri."

Suzuha: *I nod, lowering my gaze.* "...Yeah."

Okabe: *With determination in my eyes, I start up Daru’s computer and begin to search the net for communities of people who collect unique pins, ready to investigate tomorrow based on the information I find.*

Okabe: *I'm jolted awake by a loud alarm ringing in my ears.* "Is it SERN!?"

Kurisu: *I hold up my phone, the source of the sound, and look at Okabe.* "Good morning."

Okabe: *I groan, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.* "...You came to wake me up? Thanks."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, turning my gaze away from Okabe.* "I didn’t do it for you."

Suzuha: *I step forward, my gaze serious.* "I asked her to wake you up, Okabe Rintaro. There’s something I want to show you."

Okabe: *I blink, noticing a strange object on the table in front of me.* "...What’s this?"

Suzuha: *I point towards the object.* "A divergence meter. The numbers indicate the divergence value of the current worldline."

Okabe: *I study the meter, which displays 0. 337187%.* "You made this?"

Suzuha: *I shake my head, keeping my gaze steady.* "No. I brought it with me from 2036."

Okabe: *I lean in closer to the meter.* "These are Nixie tubes, right? Whoever made this has taste. I’d happily dub it Future Gadget No. 9."

Kurisu: *I step forward, my curiosity piqued.* "How exactly does it work? It shouldn’t be possible to measure changes like that."

Suzuha: *I shrug, showing my lack of knowledge on the subject.* "I don’t know either."

Okabe: *I look at Suzuha, surprised.* "You don’t know!?"

Suzuha: *I look straight at Okabe, my voice carrying a hint of mystery.* "Can you guess who made it?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, at a loss.* "How should I know?"

Suzuha: *I hold Okabe's gaze, my voice steady and serious.* "You did, Okabe Rintaro."

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by Suzuha's revelation.* "Huh?"

Suzuha: *I nod, confirming my previous statement.* "You made it, umm... 11 years from now. It apparently works the same way your special power does."

Okabe: *I glance at the meter again, this time with a sense of awe.* "Huh..."

Kurisu: *I frown, trying to make sense of it all.* "So this meter lets other people check worldline divergence?"

Suzuha: *I shake my head, my gaze falling on Okabe.* "I wish. I’m pretty sure only Okabe Rintaro would notice if the number changed."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, a smirk playing on my lips.* "What? Then there’s no point. Make something useful for once, Okabe."
