Okabe: *I swallow hard, my heart pounding as I muster the courage to ask.* "Have you met me in the future?"

Suzuha: *I glance at Okabe, my eyes briefly clouding over with a mixture of emotions before returning to their usual stoic gaze.* "...No. Never."

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, my mind racing to make sense of her answer.* "Oh... So, why are you showing me this?"

Suzuha: *I point to the meter, my finger steady.* "When the meter reads over 1%, you’ve made it to the Beta worldline."

Okabe: *My gaze shifts to the meter, my mouth dry as I repeat the number.* "1%..."

Suzuha: *I nod, my voice firm and resolved.* "Right. Reach 1% divergence... and you’ll save Shiina Mayuri."

Okabe: *I stare at the glowing red numbers, my heart pounding with a mix of fear and determination. They don’t budge. Just another 0. 6%... it seems so easy. But there are six digits after the decimal point, and no tens place. What does that mean? Something tells me it won’t be as easy as it looks.*

Suzuha: *I hold out the meter, my eyes meeting Okabe's.* "You can have it. No point in me carrying it around. I hope you’ll find a use for it."

Okabe: *I spend the morning visiting stores in Akiba, my destinations running the gamut from otaku stores packed with anime goods to souvenir shops full of Olympic memorabilia. I even visit a few that specialize in locally-manufactured goods. But although I hit just about every kind of store that could be considered niche, I am unable to find anything that resembles Suzuha’s pin. Maybe I should go all the way to Ikebukuro or Nakano. I start heading back to the lab, but just then, a street vendor catches my eye. The storekeeper is a foreigner covered in tattoos. The table next to him is covered with accessories and other fashion items. This is the first time I’ve seen such a stylish street stand in Akiba. Most vendors just sell random junk. It’s not like I have anything to lose, so I walk over and check out the selection. Among the various accessories, I see a number of metal pins. What a coincidence. Could he have a pin like Suzuha’s? I don’t see the OSHM***A 7010 logo on any of the displayed accessories, but I’d better ask just to be sure. Umm... he’s a foreigner... so maybe I should use English? Our eyes meet. His are as bright and blue as the sky. I quickly look away. Damn! He must think I’m a coward. Better get this over with.*

Okabe: *I puff out my chest, my voice booming as I make my grand introduction.* "HEY, MASTER. I AM MAD SCIENTIST. SO COOOOL. SONUVABITCH!"

Master: *I chuckle, my eyes twinkling with amusement.* "Can I help you?"

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, trying to calm my racing heart. It seems my dramatic introduction didn't have the desired effect.* "Um, I have a question, if you don’t mind."

Okabe: *I take the photocopy of Suzuha’s pin out of my pocket, holding it out for the man to see.* "Does this look familiar?"

Master: *I stare at the photocopy for a moment, then shrug, shaking my head in the exaggerated manner typical of westerners.*

Okabe: *I clench my fists, my determination unwavering.* "I want to know where it came from. Can you help me find out?"
