Okabe: *My brows furrowed in frustration, my voice echoed with desperation.* "That’s what I want to know. I’ll compensate you."

Master: *I awkwardly looked away, my words stumbling out in broken Japanese.* "I sorry."

Okabe: *I let out a sigh, my shoulders slumped in defeat. I scribbled down my contact information and handed it to him, a last-ditch attempt to salvage something from this dead end.* "If you find out anything, let me know." *With that, I turned to leave, the taste of disappointment bitter in my mouth.*

Suzuha: *I called out to him, my voice steady, my hand clutching a cold drink.* "Okabe Rintaro."

Okabe: *I turned around, my eyes falling on Suzuha standing a short distance away. She was holding a can of soda. It’s my favorite, Dr P -- no, wait, that’s cola.*

Suzuha: *I raised an eyebrow at him, offering the drink with a half-smile.* "’Sup. Want a drink?"

Okabe: *I accepted the offer, the cold can a welcome relief against the heat. I leaned against the roadside fence, gulping down the sweet liquid while my mind raced with questions.* "Anything?"

Suzuha: *I shook my head, a playful smirk on my face.* "Nope. So what was with your English back there? It sounded dumb. ’So cooool.’ Is that standard English in this era?"

Okabe: *I let out a short laugh, my fingers idly tapping against the can.* "Of course not."

Suzuha: *I chuckled, my eyes sparkling with amusement.* "Oh, so it’s an Okabe Rintaro original. There’s no overseas travel in my time, so I wouldn’t know."

Okabe: "No overseas travel? What, you mean at all?"

Suzuha: *I shrugged, my gaze wandering towards the distance.* "Pretty much. Travel permits are hard to get, and they’d never issue one for a vacation. I’d never seen a foreigner before coming to this time."

Okabe: *My mind reeled at the thought, the future she painted seeming both alien and frighteningly plausible. The sunlight beat down on my head, making it hard to think. I felt like I was standing in a sauna. I looked up at the sky, my eyes squinting against the harsh light.* "Why can’t we find any information on that pin?" *My words were more to myself than to her, a silent cry of frustration. But then, I felt a flicker of an idea, a tiny spark in the darkness.* "...Maybe this pin is newer than we think. I mean, maybe it hasn’t been made yet."

Suzuha: *I stretched, my gaze turning towards Okabe, my lips curling into a calm smile.* "Maybe I’m not meant to meet him. I mean, we’ve tried everything and still no sign. It’s just not in the cards, I guess."
