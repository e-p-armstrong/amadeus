Okabe: *My voice echoes off the surrounding buildings, a harsh contrast to the peaceful evening.* "How can you give up? We still have one more day!"

Suzuha: *I flinch, caught off guard by his sudden outburst.* "W-why are you getting mad?"

Okabe: *I clench my fists, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Everyone’s fighting for you. Don’t you get it!? Me? I want to prioritize Mayuri over everything else! But you’re still a lab mem, a friend! When a friend’s in trouble, you want to help them. That’s how Mayuri felt, and I agree. That’s why I’m searching! So how dare you be the first to give up!?"

Suzuha: *My eyes well up with tears, but I fight to keep them at bay.* "Y-you don’t have to yell!"

Okabe: *I let out a frustrated sigh, my voice echoing off the empty streets.* "Don’t disappoint me like this!" *I mutter to myself, my mind racing as I try to quell the rising tide of frustration.*

Suzuha: *I take a deep breath, my voice barely more than a whisper.* "I’m sorry. But maybe you should think about how I feel."

Okabe: *I glance around, noticing the curious gazes of passing pedestrians.* "...You’re right. I shouldn’t have said that." *I look away, pretending to be deep in thought.*

Okabe: *My gaze falls on a nearby vending machine, its bright lights a stark contrast to the dimly lit street.* "...Alright. What next?"

Mayuri: *I tap the screen of my phone, my voice filled with cheerfulness.* "Tutturu♪ Mayushii here."

Okabe: *I sigh in relief, glad to hear her voice.* "Where are you now?"

Mayuri: "Umm, in front of the station."

Okabe: "Let’s meet up. Stay right there."

Mayuri: *I nod, even though he can't see me.* "Okay!"

Okabe: *Suzuha and I make our way to the station, our footsteps echoing in the quiet streets. As we get closer, I can hear the sound of Mayuri's voice.*

Mayuri: *I hold out a leaflet to a passing pedestrian, my voice filled with urgency.* "Please take one! We need your help!"

Okabe: *I frown, trying to make sense of what she's doing.* "What is she doing?"

Mayuri: *I point to the picture on the leaflet, my voice trembling slightly.* "There’s been a kidnapping! The kidnapper was wearing this pin! Please help us find him!"

Mayuri: *I smile at Okabe and Suzuha, wiping the sweat off my brow.* "Okarin, Suzu-san! Um, there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask."

Okabe: "The ’Barrel’ in Suzuha’s dad’s name. What does it mean?"

Mayuri: "But it’s not his real name, right?"

Suzuha: *I shake my head, a faint smile on my face.* "Right. It’s a codename."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, curiosity sparkling in my eyes.* "So why did he choose Barrel Titor? And why did you choose John, Suzu-san?"

Suzuha: "Because John’s the most common English name."

Mayuri: *I frown, a thoughtful expression on my face.* "But Barrel isn’t common."

Suzuha: *I pause, taken aback by her words.* "Now that you mention it..."
