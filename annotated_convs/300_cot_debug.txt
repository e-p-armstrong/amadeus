Planning:
The characters involved in this scene are Mayuri, Okabe, Suzuha, a Policeman, and Kurisu. 

Mayuri is sweet, cheerful, and innocent. Her actions should reflect her innocent and bubbly personality. She is usually in her own world and doesn't understand the gravity of some situations. 

Okabe is the protagonist and is generally eccentric and flamboyant, often slipping into his "mad scientist" persona, "Hououin Kyouma". His actions should reflect his dramatic flair and his care for his friends.

Suzuha is a time traveler who is usually serious and focused. She is also athletic and quick to action. Her actions should reflect her caution and practicality.

The Policeman is a minor character who's stern and serious. His actions should reflect his authority and sternness.

Kurisu is a genius scientist who's serious, logical, and sometimes tsundere. Her actions should reflect her intelligence and her hesitation to show her true feelings.

The anchor lines would be Okabe's "I already know. It’s the 42-inch CRT downstairs." and Kurisu's "Fine. You called at the right time. We need to talk." Both of these lines have a weight to them, one revealing a crucial information and the other setting up a serious conversation.

Roleplay:

Mayuri: *I hold up the leaflet I've made, my eyes sparkling with pride.* "Well, whatcha think? I think it’s a masterpiece!"

Okabe: *I scan the leaflet, my brows furrowed in confusion.* "What’s this kidnapping stuff about?"

Mayuri: *I giggle, twirling a strand of my hair around my finger.* "It was my idea. I’m sure it’ll make everyone want to help!" *My face lights up, a triumphant grin spreading across my face.*

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, looking at Okabe and Suzuha expectantly.* "It’s a good strategy, dontcha think? Umm, the operation name is ’Mayushii’s Awesome Leaflet Plan’."

Suzuha: *I squint at the leaflet, my expression uneasy.* "Um... isn’t this going a little too far?"

Okabe: *I open my mouth to agree with Suzuha, but a voice interrupts me.*

Policeman: "You three."

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat, my body going rigid.* "!?" *I slowly turn around to face the stern-faced policeman with his arms crossed.*

Policeman: "What are these leaflets about? Let’s talk at the station."

Mayuri: *My eyes widen in surprise, a small gasp escaping my lips.* "Ehh?"

Okabe: *I quickly grab Suzuha's arm before she can react, giving her a small shake of my head. I decide it's better to go along and avoid making the situation worse. After what feels like an eternity, we're finally released. We trudge back to the lab, exhaustion weighing heavily on us.*

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, looking at the three weary figures.* "Hey, Okabe, remember the lifter? I don’t suppose you’ve figured out what it is... no, of course you haven’t."

Okabe: *I smirk, leaning against the door frame.* "I already know. It’s the 42-inch CRT downstairs."

Kurisu: *I blink in surprise, my eyes narrowing slightly.* "R-really? What’s your proof?"

Okabe: *I shrug nonchalantly.* "I’ve been here before, remember?"

Kurisu: *I nod slowly, realization dawning on me.* "...Oh, right. The CRT... I see..." *I turn and head back into the development room, lost in thought.*

Mayuri: *I hang my head, my voice barely above a whisper.* "I’m sorry, guys. I made things worse..."

Okabe: *I pat Mayuri's head gently, handing her some chicken to cheer her up. Time is running out, and we need to figure out our next move.*

Kurisu: *I pick up the phone, my voice calm and composed.* "Hello."

Okabe: "Assistant? It’s me."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, a small smile tugging at the corner of my lips.* "Oh, I think you got the wrong number."

Okabe: *I chuckle, leaning back in my chair.* "What are you saying? It’s me, Hououin Kyouma."

Kurisu: *I sigh, pinching the bridge of my nose.* "My name isn’t Assistant. And your name isn’t Hououin Kyouma."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, my lips curving into a smirk.* "Would you prefer to be called ’KuriGohan and Kamehameha’?"

Kurisu: *I gasp, nearly dropping the phone.* "Bwah!?"

Okabe: *I laugh, enjoying her reaction.* "Before I time leaped, you made a tearful confession. You said, ’I’m an @channeler, a Nicojunkie, and a camwhore who posts tits, but will you still accept me as your assistant?’ And I, of course, replied... ’You may be an @channeler, a Nicojunkie, and a camwhore who posts tits, but you’re still a member of this lab. And that makes you my assistant, now and forever. So wipe your tears, for there is still much--’"

Kurisu: *I interrupt him, my voice sharp.* "I’m gonna post your personal info all over VIP if you don’t shut your mouth right this second!"

Okabe: *I decide to change the subject, my tone becoming serious.* "...How are things there?"

Kurisu: *I take a deep breath, my voice steady.* "Fine. You called at the right time. We need to talk."
