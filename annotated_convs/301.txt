Okabe: *I straighten up, my gaze fixed on the horizon.* "I’ll be right there."

Kurisu: *Her eyes meet mine, steady and resolute.* "OK. I’ll be waiting."

Okabe: *With a heavy sigh, I guide Suzuha back to the lab. The familiar hum of the machines and the smell of soldering wires welcome us back. As the door creaks open, I see Kurisu waiting for us, her face unreadable.*

Kurisu: *Her eyes flash with indignation, her hands clenched at her sides.* "For your information, I don’t post t...ti... I don’t post pictures of my chest, okay!?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, chuckling at her reaction.* "It was just a joke. Let it die."

Suzuha: *She grins, crossing her arms over her chest.* "Kurigohan and Kamehameha... so you’re the one who kept picking fights with me on the internet. Makes sense."

Kurisu: *She huffs, crossing her arms in a mirror image of Suzuha.* "I thought you wanted an open discussion."

Suzuha: *She shrugs, a playful smirk on her face.* "Sure. You were kind of annoying, though."

Kurisu: *She lets out a small, amused chuckle.* "Hehehe..."

Suzuha: *She grins, her laughter echoing through the lab.* "Ahaha!"

Okabe: *I watch them, bemused.* "Are these two still fighting? By the way," *I straighten up, my chest puffing out with pride,* "it may shock you to learn that I am the poster known as Hououin Kyou--"

Kurisu & Suzuha: *Their voices overlap in perfect harmony.* "I know."

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by their synchronized response. I shake off the surprise, clearing my throat.* "So, what did you want to talk about? The Time Leap Machine?"

Kurisu: *She tilts her head, a faint frown creasing her brow.* "I think you probably forgot, so I wanted to make sure just in case. Have you been looking for the lifter? You haven’t, have you?"

Okabe: *I rub the back of my neck, a sheepish grin on my face.* "Oh, right. We hadn’t discovered what it was at this point in time. But I already know. It’s the 42-inch CRT downstairs."

Kurisu: *She blinks, her face a picture of surprise.* "R-really? What’s your proof?"

Okabe: *I lean back, my arms crossed over my chest.* "I’ve been here before, remember?"

Kurisu: *She nods, her expression thoughtful.* "I see..."

Okabe: *I look away, my gaze falling on the time machine.* "...Sorry for sticking you with this job."

Kurisu: *She raises an eyebrow, her gaze questioning.* "What? Don’t apologize. It’s creepy."

Okabe: *I sigh, my fingers drumming on the table.* "I know you’re not a fan of time travel research. But here you are building a time machine. I was just worried that maybe you were feeling conflicted."

Kurisu: *She bristles, her lips pressed into a thin line.* "How rude."

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu scowls, her cheeks tinged with a hint of red.*

Kurisu: *She crosses her arms, her gaze steady.* "I’m sure I’ve said this before, but I’ve always accepted time travel as a theory. I just don’t trust people who claim it can be done despite how unrealistic it is." *She sighs, her gaze drifting over me, taking in my worn out state.* "Besides, I can hardly deny it with evidence staring me in the face. Though I still don’t like the idea of being called the mother of the time machine."

Okabe: *I glance at Suzuha, who simply shrugs at Kurisu's statement.*

Kurisu: *She shakes her head, a faint smile playing on her lips.* "Anyway. If you’re apologizing, that must mean you helped out the first time."

Okabe: "The first time?"

Kurisu: *She nods, her gaze unwavering.* "Before you started time leaping. You helped me build the machine, didn’t you?"

Okabe: *I nod, my gaze distant as I remember the past.* "Yeah. Daru and I helped."

Kurisu: *She smiles, a genuine, warm smile.* "Then don’t worry about it. I wouldn’t want you to have to do it all over again. And right now, it’s more important to repair Amane-san’s time machine and search for her father."

Suzuha: *She bows her head, her voice barely above a whisper.* "...Sorry."

Kurisu: *She shakes her head, a faint smile on her lips.* "Don’t you apologize now. It’s weird. Welp, back to work. I should be able to get a lot done now that I know about the lifter."

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu waves and vanishes into the development room. I decide not to disturb her, my mind buzzing with thoughts. The time limit is approaching. What else can I do?*

Itaru: *His voice echoes through the lab, breaking the silence.* "Hoihoi."
