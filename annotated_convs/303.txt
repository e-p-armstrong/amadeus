Suzuha: *I pause, taking a deep breath as I prepare to reveal the harsh truth.* "...I said we never met, remember?"

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback, my brows furrowing in confusion.* "Never?"

Suzuha: *I nod, my gaze steady but filled with regret.* "Never. You were... killed by SERN. In 2025."

Okabe: *I feel a chill run down my spine at her words. SERN... The same organization that had taken Mayuri's life... It made sense they wouldn't hesitate to end mine.* "I... see."

Suzuha: *I take a moment, looking at Okabe's reaction before continuing.* "Maybe I should have told you sooner. Understand? If you don’t change the future, you’re going to die in 15 years. Shiina Mayuri will die. You will die. Makise Kurisu will be a slave to SERN. It ends badly for every lab mem."

Okabe: *I clench my fists, my mind racing. This was our fate? But...* "What about Daru?"

Suzuha: *I tilt my head, trying to recall.* "Umm, I don’t remember hearing about him. I have heard legends of a ’wizard-class hacker,’ though. Though I don’t understand what ’wizard-class’ means in the first place."

Okabe: *I can't help but smirk at the familiar term. Of course, Daru would leave such a legacy.* "Heh... That sounds like Daru alright."

Suzuha: *My eyes soften, my determination unwavering.* "Anyway, I don’t want that to happen to you guys. That’s one more reason I need to find an IBN 5100 and change the future. Until I came to this time, you guys were just stories, history. But now... you’re my friends. I want to save you."

Okabe: *I look at her, feeling a strange mix of gratitude and sadness.* "...Appreciated. You are a lab mem, now and forevermore."

Suzuha: *I can't help but chuckle, a small smile breaking on my face.* "Ahaha! Thanks."

Okabe: *With a sigh, I turn my attention back to the search for the pin, my mind still reeling from Suzuha's revelations. The sun is setting, and the heat on the roof of Radi-Kan is unbearable. I take a sip of the Dr P, finding it refreshing despite Daru's complaints.*

Itaru: *I frown at Okabe, wiping the sweat off my forehead.* "You’re supposed to give me an ice cold zero calorie cola. Common sense, man..."

Okabe: *I shrug, finishing the Dr P.* "Guess I forgot. No harm done."

Mayuri: *I speak up, breaking the heavy silence.* "Hey, Okarin. Isn’t it amazing that the satellite was a time machine?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, caught off guard by her observation.* "Yeah, I guess so."

Mayuri: *I smile, relieved that Suzuha wasn't hurt in the crash.* "I’m glad Suzu-san wasn’t hurt in the crash."
