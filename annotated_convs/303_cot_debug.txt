## Brainstorming and Planning

The scene here is a charged one, where Suzuha reveals the grim future to Okabe, Mayuri, and Daru. The characters involved are:

1. Suzuha: A time traveler and a determined character with a mission. She's honest and direct, but also shows a softer side when she reveals her desire to save her friends.
2. Okabe: The protagonist of the story, a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He can be dramatic, but in this scene, he's more thoughtful and serious.
3. Mayuri: Okabe's childhood friend, she's a cheerful and innocent character, but also shows a deeper understanding of the situation at times.
4. Daru: Okabe's best friend and a skilled hacker, he's usually laid back and focused on his own interests.

The anchor lines for this scene will be:

Suzuha: "Maybe I should have told you sooner. Understand? If you don’t change the future, you’re going to die in 15 years. Shiina Mayuri will die. You will die. Makise Kurisu will be a slave to SERN. It ends badly for every lab mem."

Okabe: "...Appreciated. You are a lab mem, now and forevermore."

These lines contain the weight of the situation and the bond between the characters. Suzuha's line will be focused on the fear and determination to change the future, while Okabe's line will emphasize the solidarity and resolve among the lab members.

## Roleplay:

Suzuha: *I pause, taking a deep breath as I prepare to reveal the harsh truth.* "...I said we never met, remember?"

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback, my brows furrowing in confusion.* "Never?"

Suzuha: *I nod, my gaze steady but filled with regret.* "Never. You were... killed by SERN. In 2025."

Okabe: *I feel a chill run down my spine at her words. SERN... The same organization that had taken Mayuri's life... It made sense they wouldn't hesitate to end mine.* "I... see."

Suzuha: *I take a moment, looking at Okabe's reaction before continuing.* "Maybe I should have told you sooner. Understand? If you don’t change the future, you’re going to die in 15 years. Shiina Mayuri will die. You will die. Makise Kurisu will be a slave to SERN. It ends badly for every lab mem."

Okabe: *I clench my fists, my mind racing. This was our fate? But...* "What about Daru?"

Suzuha: *I tilt my head, trying to recall.* "Umm, I don’t remember hearing about him. I have heard legends of a ’wizard-class hacker,’ though. Though I don’t understand what ’wizard-class’ means in the first place."

Okabe: *I can't help but smirk at the familiar term. Of course, Daru would leave such a legacy.* "Heh... That sounds like Daru alright."

Suzuha: *My eyes soften, my determination unwavering.* "Anyway, I don’t want that to happen to you guys. That’s one more reason I need to find an IBN 5100 and change the future. Until I came to this time, you guys were just stories, history. But now... you’re my friends. I want to save you."

Okabe: *I look at her, feeling a strange mix of gratitude and sadness.* "...Appreciated. You are a lab mem, now and forevermore."

Suzuha: *I can't help but chuckle, a small smile breaking on my face.* "Ahaha! Thanks."

Okabe: *With a sigh, I turn my attention back to the search for the pin, my mind still reeling from Suzuha's revelations. The sun is setting, and the heat on the roof of Radi-Kan is unbearable. I take a sip of the Dr P, finding it refreshing despite Daru's complaints.*

Itaru: *I frown at Okabe, wiping the sweat off my forehead.* "You’re supposed to give me an ice cold zero calorie cola. Common sense, man..."

Okabe: *I shrug, finishing the Dr P.* "Guess I forgot. No harm done."

Mayuri: *I speak up, breaking the heavy silence.* "Hey, Okarin. Isn’t it amazing that the satellite was a time machine?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, caught off guard by her observation.* "Yeah, I guess so."

Mayuri: *I smile, relieved that Suzuha wasn't hurt in the crash.* "I’m glad Suzu-san wasn’t hurt in the crash."
