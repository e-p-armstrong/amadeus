Mayuri: *A worried crease forms on my forehead as I recall Suzuha's words.* "If the gravitational whatchamacallit coordinates are just a teensy bit off, the whole time machine becomes a jellyman and goes ploop. And she even said her time machine’s unstable, since it’s not a SERN model. I’m worried about her trip to 1975... Do you think I should go with her? I wonder if I’d fit."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, caught off guard by her sudden proposal.* "What would you do in 1975?"

Mayuri: *My eyes sparkle with determination.* "I’d cheer Suzu-san on, of course! I’d hold her hand super tight, and tell her that everything’s going to be okay!" 

Okabe: *I let out a chuckle, shaking my head slightly.* "Something tells me that won’t be much help. But, hey, do you think the time machine has a name?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, tapping my chin thoughtfully.* "A name..."

Okabe: *I lean back, crossing my arms as I delve into my own musings.* "That’s the least of what I want to know about the time machine. Time permitting, I’d like to spend a whole day picking Suzuha’s brain. I’m pretty sure John Titor’s time machine had a model number. But the John Titor from 2000 might not have been Suzuha. There was no John Titor in 2000 on this worldline, after all. Although... I suppose it’s possible that Suzuha will drop by 2000 after traveling to 1975. If you want to know, just ask Titor."

Mayuri: *I blink, a light bulb going off in my head.* "Oh, yeah! Mayushii didn’t think of that. Ehehe!" *I giggle, quickly darting off to ask Suzuha about the time machine's name. I return just as quickly, a triumphant grin on my face.* "Yup. It has a name."

Okabe: *I look at her expectantly, curious.* "What is it?"

Mayuri: *I scratch my head, struggling to recall the exact details.* "FG204 something something, she said."

Okabe: *I chuckle, amused at her forgetfulness.* "Something something? Anyway, don’t you think Daru-kun and Suzu-san are a good match?"

Mayuri: *I blink in surprise, caught off guard.* "Huh?"

Okabe: *I glance over at Daru and Suzuha, then back at Mayuri.* "How do you figure? Daru’s all about Faris, you know."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a confused frown on my face.* "Oh... really?" 

Okabe: *I sigh, running a hand through my hair.* "Good grief... Mayuri and I aren’t of any use. I would prefer to leave Daru and Suzuha to it and resume the search for Suzuha’s father, but Mayuri seems happy just sitting here. We don’t have any leads on the pin or its owner. Maybe two days just aren’t enough. No, that’s quitter’s talk. Like I told Suzuha, I don’t want to give up." *I pause, remembering something.* "Oh yeah, Mayuri. What happened to your costumes?"

Mayuri: *I beam, proud of my handiwork.* "Hm? I already made two costumes. One for Kaede-chan and one for Fubuki-chan."

Okabe: *I nod, impressed.* "Weren’t you making a third one for Lukako?"

Mayuri: *I sigh, a bit disappointed.* "Yeah, I was. But I couldn’t convince her, so I gave up this time. Hey, can Mayushii take a closer look at the time machine?"
