Okabe: *I squint at the foreigner across from me, frustration welling up in my chest.* "Is there anything else you can tell me?"

Master: *He scratches his head, looking slightly lost.* "Um? Maybe a judo fighter? Or, pro wrestler?"

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by the sudden change in topic.* "What? Judo? Pro wrestler? What do you mean by that?"

Master: *He grins widely, pumping a fist in the air.* "YES!"

Okabe: *My eyes narrow, confusion coursing through me.* What the hell does he mean by that? That wasn’t a yes/no question.

Master: *He chuckles awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck.* "Ahh, balloon. Was balloon!"

Okabe: *I rub my temples, trying to make sense of his words.* "Balloon? Judo? Pro wrestling?"

Master: *He gives me a thumbs up, a satisfied smile on his face.* "Good!"

Okabe: *I throw my hands up in exasperation.* No! Not good! Are you trying to confuse me!? *I watch as he suddenly bolts at the sight of a policeman, leaving me alone with my thoughts.* The search has hit a dead end, and we have barely any time left to find Barrel Titor. 

Kurisu: *She carefully connects two cords, her brow furrowed in concentration.* "Done."

Okabe: *I glance at the clock.* The Time Leap Machine is complete. It’s 2:30 PM on the 13th, about 20 minutes later than before. *I watch as Kurisu walks into the lounge, a satisfied look on her face.* 

Suzuha: *She gazes at the now-complete machine in awe.* "So that’s the Time Leap Machine..."

Okabe: *I nod, watching her reaction carefully.* I’ve already explained to her how time leaping works. It’s as different as can be from Suzuha’s time machine, which can physically displace actual bodies.

Suzuha: *She crosses her hands behind her head, looking up at the ceiling.* "It makes you remember the future, right? That’s pretty interesting."

Okabe: *I watch her, my curiosity piqued by her casual acceptance of such a bizarre concept.* Some of SERN’s researchers in my time came up with the theory that memories are a way of sharing information across worldlines. Maybe it’s similar to that.

Kurisu: *She looks thoughtful, her gaze focused on some distant point.* "I just wish we knew more about Okabe’s Reading Steiner thing. Is it unique to Okabe? Or does everyone have the potential for it, and Okabe’s is just stronger by coincidence?"

Okabe: *I clench my fists, a wave of frustration washing over me.* "One thing’s for certain. My consciousness leaps to the past along with my memories."

Kurisu: *She looks at me, her eyes filled with concern.* "I still don’t understand why that is. It would make more sense if you experienced a change in the present, like you do when we send a D-Mail. Does your consciousness depend on your memories?"

Suzuha: *She shrugs, her gaze still on the ceiling.* "The problem is that consciousness doesn’t have a form that we can see. Same goes for the soul. Those things are still in the realm of religion. Even in 2036, the existence of the soul hasn’t been proven, and nobody’s proven what forms consciousness, either."

Kurisu: *She sighs, looking slightly disappointed.* "I see... that’s a little disappointing."

Okabe: *I glance at the Time Leap Machine, my thoughts racing.* "Sending my consciousness back has let me change some future events with more precision than D-Mail, but other events are locked in by convergence."
