Suzuha: *I pause, my brow furrowing in thought as I carefully choose my words.* "That’s not how it works. The future is always determined."

Okabe: *I lean back, my eyes narrowing as I try to grapple with her words.* "Then why does the path there change?"

Suzuha: *I look at Okabe, my gaze steady and serious.* "Because the worldline changes. When you leap into the past and take different actions from before, divergence changes, if only a little bit. In most cases, that fluctuation won’t amount to more than 0. 000001% on the divergence meter. Small changes might not register at all. When you change the cause, the effect merely shifts to a separate, already-existing worldline. Since those two worldlines are almost exactly the same, you barely feel any difference."

Okabe: *I tilt my head, my mind racing as I try to piece together her explanation.* Could this be why Reading Steiner didn’t react?

Suzuha: *I nod slowly, maintaining my earnest gaze.* "It’s not like the previous worldline disappears. It keeps existing as another possible worldline."

Kurisu: *I interject, my voice slightly skeptical.* "That’s the many-worlds interpretation, right?"

Suzuha: *I shrug, my tone still matter-of-fact.* "In any case, they’re not parallel worlds."

Okabe: *I furrow my brows, my heart pounding as I grapple with the concept.* "So is the future reconstructed?"

Suzuha: *I ponder for a moment before nodding.* "I guess you could say that."

Okabe: *I sigh, my thoughts swirling. The complexity of the universe feels overwhelming.* I'm confused again. Maybe it’s impossible for me to fully understand the structure of the universe. But now's not the time for pondering. It’s time for me to leap again. I turn to Kurisu, explaining the situation, and have her activate the Time Leap Machine immediately.

Okabe: *I find myself in the night of the 11th, having gone back about 40 hours. My objective clear in my mind, I keep watch on the street vendor’s stand in the hope that Suzuha’s father might appear. I've sent Suzuha elsewhere. I don’t want her to be disappointed if I come up empty-handed. I position myself out of sight a short distance away from the stand, munching on energy bars and soy milk to appease my growling stomach.*

Okabe: *I've been here for two hours now. I forgot to ask for the exact time the suspicious character appeared, so I had to begin my stakeout before sunset. Now it’s 8 PM and the stand looks like it’s about to close. Is this another waste of time? Did that foreigner give me false information? But just as I’m finishing my milk... Someone approaches the stand.* "Is that...!?"

Okabe: *I jump out of cover, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Daru!"

Itaru: *I jump in surprise, turning to Okabe with wide eyes.* "Okarin!?"

Okabe: *I stare at Daru, shock coursing through me.* "What are you doing here!?"

Itaru: *I blink at Okabe, equally surprised.* "I was gonna ask the same question."

Okabe: *I glance at the storekeeper, who's looking at us funny. Deciding it's best to move, I gesture for Daru to follow me.* "Alright, Daru. What were you doing at that street stand? Don’t tell me you were trying to counterfeit duplicates of Titor’s pin."

Itaru: *I shrug, a sheepish grin on my face.* "...F-fine. I won’t tell you then."

Okabe: *I groan, realizing what had happened. Daru was the suspicious character the foreigner told me about. So all that stuff about judo, pro wrestling, and balloons was referring to Daru’s size?* "Could he have been more confusing!?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, feeling a wave of relief wash over me. At least I didn't bring Suzuha along.* "So why were you trying to make counterfeit versions of the pin?"

Itaru: *I chuckle, scratching the back of my head.* "Uh, I wasn’t trying to counterfeit it."
