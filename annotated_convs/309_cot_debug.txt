Planning/Thoughts/Brainstorming:

Characters involved:
1. Okabe: The protagonist of the series, often brimming with exaggerated theatrics and flamboyance, but also capable of deep thought and consideration. He's very involved with the time machine project and cares about his friends. 
2. Itaru: A close friend of Okabe, who's a bit of an otaku and laid-back, but also serious about the time machine and Suzuha's situation. 

Writing styles: 
- For Okabe, I will use a more dramatic and grandiose style, with a dash of science and logic to portray his intelligence. His thoughts will be analytical and observant. 
- For Itaru, I will use a more casual and carefree style, with moments of seriousness and concern when discussing Suzuha's situation. 

Anchors:
1. Itaru's line about Suzuha's time machine only being able to leap to the past will be a major anchor for the scene. It's a shocking revelation that changes the stakes of the situation.
2. Okabe's realization that Itaru's attempt to make a copy of Suzuha's father's pin isn't going to solve anything will be another anchor. It's a moment of clarity amidst the confusion.

Roleplay:

Itaru: *I scratch the back of my head, my eyes looking away as I try to justify my actions.* "Well... I meant it as a backup plan, I guess. Amane-shi’s gonna be sad if we don’t find her old man, right? So if that happens, I’ll show her the badges I made and, well, lie that her dad was here..."

Okabe: *I grimace, my hands tightening into fists at the thought.* "So you’ll give her false hope."

Itaru: *I shrug, trying to lighten the mood.* "You don’t have to put it like that. Remember, there are good lies and bad lies: bad lies hurt people, good lies save them!"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, skepticism clear in my voice.* "What eroge did you get that from?"

Itaru: *I puff out my chest defensively.* "CLADDAN... and it’s not an eroge, it’s a visual novel that teaches you the meaning of life, so shut up! So... should I call off Operation Fake Titor?"

Okabe: *I cross my arms, my gaze hardened.* "Do you really think that will make Suzuha happy?"

Itaru: *Suddenly, my mood shifts, and I look down, my expression clouded with sadness.* "Amane-shi told me not to tell anyone, but... I guess I’d better tell you."

Okabe: *I notice his change in demeanor, and my playful facade fades. His seriousness convinces me to listen closely.* "I heard this from Amane-shi when we were discussing the repairs. Her time machine... can only leap to the past."

Okabe: *His words hit me like a punch to the gut. I blink in surprise, struggling to process the information.* "...What?"

Itaru: *I glance at him, my lips pressed into a thin line.* "Did you actually see it?"

Okabe: *Caught off guard, I stutter.* "Well, no..."

Itaru: *I continue, my voice taking on a somber tone.* "Besides, when you say Titor, you mean the one who appeared in 2000, don’t you? I don’t know anything about that Titor."

Okabe: *His words make me pause. I realize there might be more to this than I initially thought.* "So... wait."

Itaru: *I nod, my gaze filled with regret.* "Once she leaves, she can’t come back."

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest as I try to grasp the reality of the situation.* "You’re saying that if she goes to 1975, she can’t return to 2010?"

Itaru: *I sigh, my shoulders slumping.* "Not without living 35 years in real time."

Okabe: *I feel my stomach drop at the thought.* "Does that mean Suzuha’s time machine can never return to 2036?"

Itaru: *I nod, my face grim.* "Didn’t I just say that?"

Okabe: *I feel a wave of panic wash over me.* "Then it’s defective!"

Itaru: *I nod again, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Right. She said the time machine was incomplete."

Okabe: *My mind races as I try to piece together the information. Incomplete? Incomplete!?* "Are you sure about this?"

Itaru: *I look him straight in the eye, my expression sincere.* "She said so herself. I don’t think she was lying. So if she doesn’t meet her old man before the time machine is repaired... She might never get another chance."

Okabe: *I clench my jaw, my gaze hardening as I realize the gravity of the situation.* "But making a fake version of her father’s pin isn’t going to solve anything. A lie is a lie."

Itaru: *I look at him, desperation clear in my eyes.* "But if we don’t get caught..."
