Mayuri: *As I watch Daru and Suzuha from a distance, I can't help but feel a sense of amazement.* "Hey, Okarin. Isn’t it amazing that the satellite was a time machine?"

Okabe: *I glance at her, trying to gauge her feelings.* "Yeah, I guess so."

Mayuri: *I clasp my hands together, a worried expression crossing my face.* "I’m glad Suzu-san wasn’t hurt in the crash. I heard it’s really hard to drive. If the gravitational whatchamacallit coordinates are just a teensy bit off, the whole time machine becomes a jellyman and goes ploop. And she even said her time machine’s unstable, since it’s not a SERN model. I’m worried about her trip to 1975... Do you think I should go with her? I wonder if I’d fit."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, considering her words.* "What would you do in 1975?"

Mayuri: *I puff out my chest, determination in my eyes.* "I’d cheer Suzu-san on, of course! I’d hold her hand super tight, and tell her that everything’s going to be okay! Hey, Okarin, do you think the time machine has a name?"

Okabe: *I shrug, trying to lighten the mood.* "If you want to know, just ask Titor."

Mayuri: *I laugh, a light, carefree sound.* "Oh, yeah! Mayushii didn’t think of that. Ehehe!" *I run off to talk to Suzuha, returning a few seconds later.* "Yup. It has a name. FG204 something something, she said. Anyway, don’t you think Daru-kun and Suzu-san are a good match?"

Okabe: *I look at Daru and Suzuha again, considering her words.* "Daru’s all about Faris."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, a puzzled look on my face.* "Oh... really?" *I ask, then I look at the time machine, curiosity piqued.* "Hey, can Mayushii take a closer look at the time machine?" *I run over to the time machine again, the setting sun casting long shadows behind me.*

Suzuha: *As Mayuri leaves, I come over to stand beside Okabe, my gaze on the horizon.* "Hashida Itaru’s amazing. He said if things go well, he could have the time machine fixed by tomorrow. And he looks so unhealthy and slow." *I pause, the breeze ruffling my hair.* "Umm... hey. There’s something I want to say, and I feel like I’ll never get another chance. Are you listening?"

Okabe: *I hesitate, then give a small nod, indicating my attention.*

Suzuha: *I take a deep breath, my gaze steady on Okabe.* "I’m really grateful to you. All of you. When I came to this time, I didn’t know anyone. I was all alone in a world completely different from my own. This era is so peaceful. That’s a wonderful thing... but it scared me. All I knew was the fight against SERN. But now I have friends... real friends, who I can share my secrets with. All these people who lived before I was born are working so hard for my sake. It’s a strange feeling... but a happy one, too. I wanted you to know that."
