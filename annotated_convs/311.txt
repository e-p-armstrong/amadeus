Suzuha: *I take a deep breath, my gaze distant as I remember the bleak future I've come from.* "Anyway, people don’t fight. Ever. About anything. All forms of conflict, war included, have vanished -- poof -- without a trace. Instead, everyone has dead eyes, like fish. No one has ambition. Nobody dreams. They just trudge through their lives without a single complaint. Oh sure, people smile. But they never get angry or sad. There’s no individuality. Everyone’s a robot. You got really mad at me before, remember? I was really surprised. But at the same time... I was really happy."

Suzuha: *My gaze drifts over to where Daru and Mayuri are standing by the time machine, their laughter a stark contrast to the weight of our conversation.* "You’re all so bright and full of life. I envy you. Shiina Mayuri, Hashida Itaru... even Makise Kurisu. And of course, you. I want to be more like you. It’s thanks to all of you that I’m still going strong. Being a lab mem, even for just a little while... was great."

Suzuha: *I offer a small smile, bittersweet and tinged with sorrow.* "Being with you guys, even for just a little while... was great."

Suzuha: *I look straight into Okabe's eyes, my determination unwavering.* "Change the future, Okabe Rintaro. Make it a world like this one, where people can be free."

Okabe: *I struggle to find the words, my heart heavy with the gravity of Suzuha's mission.* "Do you..."

Suzuha: *I tilt my head slightly, curious.* "Hm?"

Okabe: "Do you regret spending time with us?"

Suzuha: *I furrow my brows, caught off guard by the question.* "...What do you mean?"

Okabe: "Do you regret making new friends here? New memories? Do you wish you had kept your distance? You’ve already abandoned one life. Now you have to abandon another. In a sense... it’s like you’re killing yourself."

Suzuha: *My expression hardens, a shadow passing over my face.* "...Did Hashida Itaru tell you?"

Okabe: "He’s worried about you."

Suzuha: *I let out a sigh, my frustration seeping through.* "Geez. I told him not to tell anybody."

Okabe: "Well? How do you feel about going to 1975?"

Suzuha: *I steel myself, my jaw set and my eyes determined.* "...It doesn’t matter how I feel. I have to go. It’s the path I chose, and it’s what my dad wanted."

Okabe: "What if we ask you to stay?"

Suzuha: *I shake my head, my resolve unwavering.* "I’ll go anyway. One of those guys on @channel asked what right I have to change the future and decide the fate of the human race. He had a point. But still... I don’t want the future to turn out like that. I want the people in my time to be free like you. Free to laugh and play, fight and argue, get sad and cry. If I change the future, then no one will die. Not you, not Shiina Mayuri, and not my dad. Maybe I don’t have the right... but I’m going anyway." *I say, my voice resolute, every word carrying the weight of my conviction.*
