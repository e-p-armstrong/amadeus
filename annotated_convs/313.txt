Mayuri: *I suddenly raise my hands, trying to catch everyone's attention.* "Actually... Mayushii found Suzu-san’s dad!" *I announce proudly, oblivious to the confused looks around me.*

Okabe: "Huh?" *I blurt out, taken aback by Mayuri's sudden announcement.*

Suzuha: "What!?" *I exclaim, my eyes wide in disbelief.*

Itaru: "Really!?" *I ask, my voice filled with curiosity.*

Mayuri: *I puff out my chest proudly, enjoying the attention.* "Wanna meet him? You do, don't you? Well, he’s here with us today!"

Suzuha: "W-where?" *I stutter, my heart pounding in anticipation.*

Okabe: *I begin to scan the room, my eyes darting from one corner to another, unable to contain my curiosity.*

Mayuri: *I pause for dramatic effect.* "Allow me to introduce you! Suzu-san’s dad is... Drrrrrrrrrrrr..."

Itaru: "Is that a drum roll!?" *I interrupt, unable to contain my laughter.*

Mayuri: "Tada! Suzu-san’s dad is..." *I flash Suzuha a triumphant grin.* "Daru-kun!" 

Kurisu: *I let out a laugh, unable to contain it.* "That joke’s not even logical. It’s impossible for this perv to get married in the first place."

Itaru: "Hey... that kind of hurts." *I say, pretending to be hurt by Kurisu's remark.*

Okabe: "I completely agree with Christina. Daru is fated to become a wizard when he turns thirty." *I say, joining in the teasing.*

Itaru: "You could be nicer about it, guys... but it’s the truth, so I can’t object." *I say, admitting defeat.*

Suzuha: "Um... you know... my dad wasn’t fat." *I say, trying to bring some reason into the conversation.*

Mayuri: "Geez. You’re all so mean to Daru-kun." *I reprimand, feeling sorry for Daru.*

Itaru: "Mayu-shi’s the only one to stand up for me. You’re an angel, Mayu-shi. Do you love me?" *I ask, a hopeful smile on my face.*

Mayuri: "Nope." *I reply, shaking my head.*

Mayuri: "Um, Mayushii’s one hundred million percent sure that Daru-kun is Suzuha’s dad." *I insist, my voice firm.*

Kurisu: "Okay. What’s your proof?" *I ask, my arms crossed in challenge.*

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, thinking hard.* "Um, I was thinking about the letters on Suzu-san’s pin... After staring at it really hard, I noticed the 7 in ’7010’ looked a little weird. It’s not a 7, it’s a 2. The line fell off the bottom."

Suzuha: "R-really?" *I ask, my heart pounding as I stare at the pin again.*

Mayuri: "It’s easy to see on the picture we took!" *I say, pulling out my phone.*

Kurisu: "2010? But that’s this year!" *I exclaim, my eyes widening in realization.*

Okabe: "Then what do the letters mean?" *I ask, my curiosity piqued.*

Mayuri: "That’s easy! Okabe, Shiina, Hashida, Makise. And finally, Amane." *I say, feeling proud of my deduction.*
