Planning Stage:
1. The main characters involved in this scene are Mayuri, Okabe, Suzuha, Itaru, and Kurisu. 
2. Mayuri is the sweet, cheerful, and somewhat naive character. Her actions should reflect her innocence and optimism. 
3. Okabe is the eccentric, dramatic, and intelligent character. His actions should be thoughtful, yet erratic. 
4. Suzuha is the tough, serious, and goal-oriented character. Her actions should reflect her determination and surprise in this scene.
5. Itaru is the nerdy, lazy, and humorous character. His actions should reflect his laid-back personality.
6. Kurisu is the logical, introverted, and stubborn character. Her actions should be calculated and expressive of her analytical nature.
7. Anchoring lines could be Mayuri's announcement about Suzuha's dad and her final explanation about the pin. These lines carry the most weight and should be elaborated on.
8. The scene is a mixture of humor and surprise. The word choices and writing styles should reflect this atmosphere.

Roleplay:

Mayuri: *I suddenly raise my hands, trying to catch everyone's attention.* "Actually... Mayushii found Suzu-san’s dad!" *I announce proudly, oblivious to the confused looks around me.*

Okabe: "Huh?" *I blurt out, taken aback by Mayuri's sudden announcement.*

Suzuha: "What!?" *I exclaim, my eyes wide in disbelief.*

Itaru: "Really!?" *I ask, my voice filled with curiosity.*

Mayuri: *I puff out my chest proudly, enjoying the attention.* "Wanna meet him? You do, don't you? Well, he’s here with us today!"

Suzuha: "W-where?" *I stutter, my heart pounding in anticipation.*

Okabe: *I begin to scan the room, my eyes darting from one corner to another, unable to contain my curiosity.*

Mayuri: *I pause for dramatic effect.* "Allow me to introduce you! Suzu-san’s dad is... Drrrrrrrrrrrr..."

Itaru: "Is that a drum roll!?" *I interrupt, unable to contain my laughter.*

Mayuri: "Tada! Suzu-san’s dad is..." *I flash Suzuha a triumphant grin.* "Daru-kun!" 

Kurisu: *I let out a laugh, unable to contain it.* "That joke’s not even logical. It’s impossible for this perv to get married in the first place."

Itaru: "Hey... that kind of hurts." *I say, pretending to be hurt by Kurisu's remark.*

Okabe: "I completely agree with Christina. Daru is fated to become a wizard when he turns thirty." *I say, joining in the teasing.*

Itaru: "You could be nicer about it, guys... but it’s the truth, so I can’t object." *I say, admitting defeat.*

Suzuha: "Um... you know... my dad wasn’t fat." *I say, trying to bring some reason into the conversation.*

Mayuri: "Geez. You’re all so mean to Daru-kun." *I reprimand, feeling sorry for Daru.*

Itaru: "Mayu-shi’s the only one to stand up for me. You’re an angel, Mayu-shi. Do you love me?" *I ask, a hopeful smile on my face.*

Mayuri: "Nope." *I reply, shaking my head.*

Mayuri: "Um, Mayushii’s one hundred million percent sure that Daru-kun is Suzuha’s dad." *I insist, my voice firm.*

Kurisu: "Okay. What’s your proof?" *I ask, my arms crossed in challenge.*

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, thinking hard.* "Um, I was thinking about the letters on Suzu-san’s pin... After staring at it really hard, I noticed the 7 in ’7010’ looked a little weird. It’s not a 7, it’s a 2. The line fell off the bottom."

Suzuha: "R-really?" *I ask, my heart pounding as I stare at the pin again.*

Mayuri: "It’s easy to see on the picture we took!" *I say, pulling out my phone.*

Kurisu: "2010? But that’s this year!" *I exclaim, my eyes widening in realization.*

Okabe: "Then what do the letters mean?" *I ask, my curiosity piqued.*

Mayuri: "That’s easy! Okabe, Shiina, Hashida, Makise. And finally, Amane." *I say, feeling proud of my deduction.*
