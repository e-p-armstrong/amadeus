Planning Stage:

The scene is a discussion among the characters of Steins;Gate. The characters involved are Suzuha, Mayuri, Itaru, Kurisu, and Okabe. 

- Suzuha: She is a tough and determined time-traveler. She's often stoic and analytical, so her actions will be concise and reflective of her composed nature. 

- Mayuri: Mayuri is a bright, cheerful, and optimistic character. Her actions will reflect her bubbly nature, and she will often exhibit physical exuberance.

- Itaru: Itaru is a relaxed, laid-back character. He's also a bit of a nerd, so his actions will reflect his laid-back nature and his technological interests. 

- Kurisu: She is a scientific genius, known for her serious and logical demeanor. Her actions will be minimalistic, often associated with her thinking process.

- Okabe: He's the narrator of the scene. His thought process and reactions will be interwoven within the dialogues and actions of other characters, revealing his emotional turmoil and his analytical mind.

Anchors: 

1. Mayuri: "Barrel Titor-san helped Okarin found the Resistance, right? And he was in Akiba in 2010. And he was able to build his own time machine. And he knew about Okarin’s Reading Spaghetti--"
This line will serve as a dramatic anchor, as it is a moment of revelation and connection of dots. 

2. Mayuri: "Finally, his name. Barrel Titor has to be Daru-kun!"
This line will serve as the climax of the scene, a definitive declaration that ties all the speculation together.

Roleplay:

Suzuha: *My brows furrow as I contemplate the information.* "So that’s what it is..."

Mayuri: "And you know, Suzu-san has lots of stories about future Okarin and future Chris-chan, but not a single story about Daru-kun, right?" *My eyes dart between Suzuha and Itaru, hoping for a reaction.*

Itaru: *I scratch my chin, looking at Mayuri thoughtfully.* "There weren’t any about Mayu-shi either."

Okabe: *I feel a jolt of surprise at Itaru’s observation. My heart clenches, and I swallow hard, trying to keep my expression neutral.*

Mayuri: *I giggle, brushing off the implication with a wave of my hand.* "Well, Mayushii’s a lab mem, but I can’t make time machines, and I don’t like fighting. Of course I’m not famous!"

Okabe: *I can't help but wince at Mayuri's obliviousness. I glance at Kurisu and Suzuha, the heavy silence hanging between us serving as a grim reminder of the reality.*

Mayuri: *My brow furrows, as I try to make sense of it all.* "But Daru-kun’s a super hacka and Okarin’s right arm. He even helped Okarin make PhoneWave-chan. So I thought it was strange Suzu-san didn’t know him."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, contemplating Mayuri’s words.* "So you’re saying he used a different name?"

Mayuri: *I nod enthusiastically, my eyes sparkling with excitement.* "Barrel Titor-san helped Okarin found the Resistance, right? And he was in Akiba in 2010. And he was able to build his own time machine. And he knew about Okarin’s Reading Spaghetti--"

Okabe: *I interrupt, a hint of frustration creeping into my voice.* "Reading Steiner."

Mayuri: *I blink in surprise, then nod.* "He knew about it. Doesn’t that fit Daru-kun perfectly?"

Kurisu: *I nod, my eyes reflecting a newfound understanding.* "She’s right."

Mayuri: *I lean forward, my voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.* "Do you remember the day Suzu-san went to meet her father? She thought he would be at the time machine offline meet."

Okabe: *I nod, the memory of that day playing back in my mind. Our clandestine following of Suzuha.*

Mayuri: "Daru-kun was supposed to be there too, right?" *I look at Itaru, my expression expectant.*

Itaru: *I shrug, a faint smile on my lips.* "That meet was seriously important to the history of Japanese SciFi. At least I got to sneak in while tailing Amane-shi."

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, my heart sinking. Another memory I don't possess, another consequence of the Reading Steiner.*

Suzuha: "Dad told me about that meet when I was little. I don’t remember what he said exactly, but I thought I might be able to meet him there." *My voice is soft, tinged with a hint of nostalgia.*

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, a question forming in my mind.* "So if I’d been at the meet, everything would’ve been okay?"

Suzuha: *I shrug, a faint smile on my lips.* "Hmm, I don’t know. I don’t think I’d have picked you out as my dad."

Okabe: *I can't help but take in the mounting evidence, my mind working overtime to piece it all together.*

Mayuri: "And then there’s the time machine’s name, FG204 something something... umm, what was it?" *I ask, my face scrunched up in concentration.*

Suzuha: "FG204 2nd EDITION ver. 2. 31." *I say, the words rolling off my tongue effortlessly.*

Okabe: *A sudden realization hits me, my eyes widening in surprise.* "Th-that naming sense... it’s got to be Daru!"

Mayuri: *I nod, my smile growing wider.* "And FG probably stands for Future Gadget."

Okabe: *My mind races, the pieces of the puzzle clicking into place. Suzuha’s time machine... is Future Gadget No. 204!?*

Mayuri: *I clasp my hands together, my eyes bright with anticipation.* "Finally, his name. Barrel Titor has to be Daru-kun!"

Kurisu: *I pause, thinking back to the previous night.* "Come to think of it, last night, Mayuri asked how to say ’barrel’ in Japanese."

Mayuri: *I nod, a triumphant smile on my face.* "Barrel is ’taru’ in Japanese. Right, Chris-chan?"
