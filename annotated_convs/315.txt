Okabe: *My eyebrows furrow in confusion, my mind struggling to put the pieces together.* "Taru... Taru... Daru!?"

Suzuha: *I gasp slightly, my eyes widening in surprise.* "It’s a pun!?"

Mayuri: *I giggle, clapping my hands together in excitement.* "Okay, Suzu-san! Say ’Hashida Itaru’ ten times fast!"

Suzuha: *I blink, taken aback by Mayuri's request.* "Wh-why?"

Mayuri: *I wag my finger at Suzuha, a mischievous grin on my face.* "Just say it and find out! Ehehe!"

Suzuha: "HashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaru... HashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaru"

Mayuri: *I point at Suzuha, my smile widening.* "Just now, didn’t it sound like ’Ditor’?"

Kurisu: *I nod, my brows furrowed in thought.* "It did."

Mayuri: "Hashidaitaru. Hashi-daita-ru. Hashi-Ditor-ru. Hashi-Titor-ru."

Itaru: *My eyes widen in disbelief, my mouth hanging open.* "...For reals?"

Mayuri: *I nod enthusiastically, clapping my hands together.* "For super reals♪"

Okabe: *I stare in disbelief, my mind reeling from the revelation. I look at Daru and Suzuha, my jaw dropping.* 

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a smile playing on my lips.* "I think she looks just like her father♪"

Kurisu: *I sigh, rubbing my temples.* "That could just be the placebo effect... but now that you mention it, they kinda do look alike."

Okabe: *I nod, a proud smile tugging at my lips.* "Nice work, Mayuri! You’ll make a great detective one day."

Mayuri: *I blush, my hands fluttering to my chest.* "A d-detective? Ehehe! That’s the first time anyone’s said that."

Okabe: *I chuckle, shaking my head. Despite her ditziness, Mayuri had a unique way of perceiving things.*

Itaru: *I stare at Suzuha, my eyes wide and my mouth dry.* "My... d-daughter? Amane-shi is my daughter?"

Suzuha: *I swallow, my eyes filling with tears.* "Dad..."

Itaru: *I gulp, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Uh... c-c-could you call me Papa instead?"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, crossing my arms.* "For once in your life, don’t be a perv..."

Suzuha: *I choke back a sob, my hands clenched into fists.* "Dad...!"

Okabe: *I watch as Suzuha struggles to hold back her tears, my heart aching for her. I glance at Daru, who seems lost for words.* 

Suzuha: *I take a deep breath, steeling myself.* "I came, Dad. I came to see you... in the time machine you built."

Itaru: *I nod, swallowing hard.* "Yeah..."

Suzuha: *I smile, determination lighting up my eyes.* "I’m going to finish what you started. I promise."

Itaru: *I nod again, my heart swelling with pride.* "Yeah..."

Suzuha: *I reach out, taking Daru's hand in mine.* "Watch over me. Okay?"

Itaru: *I squeeze Suzuha's hand, my voice choked with emotion.* "I’m watching. Of course I am!"

Okabe: *I watch as Suzuha hugs Daru, a lump forming in my throat. It was a touching moment, a father and daughter reunited across time.*

Itaru: "B-by the way, was your mother cute? Request petite girl with cute face and big boobs."

Suzuha: *I laugh, shaking my head.* "Ahaha. That’s a secret."

Okabe: *I smile, relieved to see Suzuha's bright smile once again.* 

Suzuha: "Well! That takes care of everything I wanted to do on this worldline. Guess I should be going."

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback.* "W-wait! You’re going already? Don’t you have more to say to your father?"
