Planning/Thoughts:
Characters involved: Suzuha, Okabe, and Itaru (Daru). 

Suzuha is a warrior from the future, determined and resolute. Her *actions* will be decisive and weighted with the gravity of her mission. 

Okabe is the self-proclaimed mad scientist, but in this scene, he is more of a silent observer, deeply moved by the unfolding events. His *actions* will be introspective, full of sentiment and contemplation.

Itaru is a skilled hacker and a friend of Okabe. He's usually laid-back and somewhat timid, but in this scene, his emotions are on full display. His *actions* will be filled with raw emotion and sincerity.

The anchor lines will be Suzuha's farewell and Itaru's heartfelt promise. These lines will be framed with a mix of melancholy and hope, reflecting the bittersweet farewell and the promise of a changed future.

Roleplay:

Suzuha: *I stand tall, my gaze steady and filled with a warrior's resolve.* "I’ll bring it to you here in Akihabara. That’s my duty, and I’ll see it through. The rest is up to you. Change the future. Please."

Okabe: *We stand in silence, our minds reeling from the enormity of her words. I feel the weight of her trust settle on my shoulders, and I meet her gaze, our resolve reflected in each other's eyes.* 

Suzuha: *A soft laugh escapes my lips, a touch of levity amidst the gravity of the situation.* "Well, see you in 35 years... though I guess it’ll only be a few hours for you guys. Ahaha! Oh, I almost forgot. The time machine gives off terrific ultraviolet rays when it jumps, so make sure not to look directly at it."

Suzuha: *With a final wave, I board the time machine, the metallic hatch closing behind me with a soft hiss.*

Okabe: *As the time machine whirs to life, I feel my phone vibrate in my pocket. Pulling it out, I see a message from Suzuha. 'Goodbye...' I read, my heart heavy. I look up from the message, my eyes squinting against the blinding light enveloping the time machine.* "Suzuha..."

Okabe: *A sense of finality washes over me as I watch the light envelop the time machine. We'll never see this Suzuha again, not the one we've come to know. Despite knowing we'll meet again in our time, I can't shake off the sorrow of this farewell.*

Itaru: *Overwhelmed with emotion, I step forward, my voice trembling but determined.* "S-Suzuha!! I’m sure we’ll meet again! I’ll do my best until then! I hate myself for not knowing any other way to say it, but I’ll do my best! I’ll do my best, I promise! So Suzuha, do your best too!"
