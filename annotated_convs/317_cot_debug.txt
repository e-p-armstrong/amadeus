Planning:

Characters:
- Okabe: The protagonist and main thinker. He's a bit eccentric and dramatic, prone to exaggerated gestures and grand statements.
- Itaru: A laid-back and somewhat geeky character, often anxious about life's surprises.
- Kurisu: Intelligent and serious, yet shows a soft side occasionally. She's sharp and quick to react.
- Mayuri: Innocent and cheerful, often oblivious to the gravity of situations.
- Tennouji: A stern and imposing figure, he's direct and no-nonsense in his approach.

Writing Style:
- Okabe: I'll use a mix of dramatic and introspective language. His thoughts will be quite complex, reflecting his analytical nature.
- Itaru: His actions will be casual, reflecting his laid-back personality. His language will be informal and colloquial.
- Kurisu: Her actions and thoughts will be sharp and decisive. She'll use precise and succinct language.
- Mayuri: Her actions will be bubbly and naive, and her language will be simple and joyful.
- Tennouji: His language will be curt and straightforward. His actions will reflect his imposing, direct nature.

Anchors:
- Itaru's realization about his potential great-grandkids. I'll emphasize his shock and anxiety here.
- Okabe's receipt of the letter from Suzuha. This holds significant narrative weight, so I'll add a strong emotional reaction from Okabe.

Roleplay:

Itaru: *I take a deep breath, trying to wrap my mind around the strange reality of my situation.* "My daughter is 30 years older than me. I don’t know if I want to see that. Feels weird, man."

Kurisu: *I tilt my head, a teasing smirk playing on my lips.* "You know, it wouldn’t be unusual for her to have grandchildren by that age."

Itaru: *I stagger back as if hit, my eyes widening in shock.* "Y-you mean I could have great-grandkids? I don’t know if I’m ready for that, man..."

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes twinkling with excitement.* "Just be super nice to them! That’s what grandpas do!"

Itaru: *I hold up my hands in a defensive gesture, shaking my head.* "Please, don’t call me grandpa..."

Okabe: *Suddenly, a knock on the door cuts through our idle chatter. Everyone's eyes turn to me. With a strange mixture of anticipation and anxiety, I slowly reach out and turn the doorknob.* 

Tennouji: *I feel a wave of disappointment as I see the familiar face.* "Okabe!"

Okabe: *I lean against the door frame, trying to hide my disappointment.* "Oh, it’s you..."

Tennouji: "Hey, have you seen my part-timer?"

Mayuri: *I start to answer, my words tumbling out in a rush.* "If you’re looking for Suzu-san, she went 35 years--"

Kurisu: *I quickly move to cover Mayuri’s mouth, my eyes wide with alarm.* "Shaddup, Mayuri!"

Tennouji: *I squint suspiciously at the two girls.* "You know something? Where’d that girl run off to? She took the last couple days off and I don’t know when she’s coming next. She won’t even answer her phone."

Okabe: *I run a hand through my hair, struggling to keep my face neutral.* "She said she went back to her hometown. She’s probably gone for good."

Tennouji: *I furrow my brows, clearly not happy with the news.* "What!? You sure? That brat. She didn’t say a word to me."

Okabe: *Watching Tennouji's reaction, I can't help but feel a spark of hope. The future is changing. Isn't this proof?* 

Tennouji: *I sigh, then look at Okabe with a serious expression.* "Well, whatever. I’ve got something for you, Okabe."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, my interest piqued.* "...For me?"

Tennouji: *I hand Okabe an envelope. It's unmarked, save for the name Hashida Suzu on the back.* 

Okabe: *I take the envelope, my heart pounding in my chest. This could change everything.* "What is this?"
