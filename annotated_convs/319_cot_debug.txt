Planning:
- Okabe: He is the main character and a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He is dramatic, often lost in his thoughts, and prone to emotional outbursts. His actions and thoughts will be filled with deep introspection and a mixture of despair and determination.
- Itaru: Also known as Daru, he is a skilled hacker and a close friend of Okabe. He is more laid-back and has a light-hearted personality but can be serious when the situation calls for it. His actions will reflect his anxiousness and guilt in the current situation.
- Kurisu: She is a genius scientist and a key member of the lab. She is logical, calm, and often the voice of reason. Her actions will show her attempting to maintain peace and understanding.
- Tennouji: He is the owner of the building where Okabe's lab is located. He is stern and serious. His actions will reflect his confusion and curiosity about Okabe's sudden questions.
Anchor Lines: Okabe's line "Missed something!? Whatever you missed cost your daughter 24 years of her life!" and "Hashida Suzu-san... how did she die?" will serve as anchors, highlighting Okabe's despair, desperation, and determination to find answers.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I clench my fists, my voice trembling with restrained anger.* "Daru... didn’t you fix the time machine?"

Itaru: *I flinch at Okabe's words, my eyes darting nervously as I fumble with my words.* "I... I did... I thought I did... but I mean, that was my first time repairing a time machine. I might have missed something."

Okabe: *My words erupt like a volcano, the anger and despair I've been holding back now unleashed.* "Missed something!? Whatever you missed cost your daughter 24 years of her life!"

Itaru: *My face pales, guilt and regret washing over me.* "I didn’t do it on purpose!"

Kurisu: *I step in between Okabe and Itaru, my voice calm but firm.* "Calm down, both of you. Hashida did everything he could. He doesn’t deserve your anger, Okabe."

Okabe: *I turn to Kurisu, incredulity etched on my face.* "How can you be so calm!?"

Kurisu: *I meet Okabe's gaze, my eyes steady.* "That’s how I am. Sorry. Now calm down."

Okabe: *A low growl escapes my throat, and I clench my fists tighter.* "Gh..."

Okabe: *I know it’s not Daru’s fault. But it can’t end like this. It can’t! I look again at the words scrawled upon the page, every character resonant with despair. I wanted to welcome Suzuha back with a smile. Instead... this. Suzuha is dead, ten years gone. I run to the window and check the street. Mister Braun is outside, closing up shop.* "Mister Braun!"

Okabe: *I rush out of the lab, my heart pounding as I run downstairs.*

Tennouji: *I turn towards Okabe, a puzzled look on my face.* "Okabe! Did you hear? That satellite up and disappeared. Everyone’s talking about it."

Okabe: *I barely register Tennouji's words, my mind focused on one thing.* "Please... I need to know."

Tennouji: *I raise an eyebrow at Okabe, confusion evident on my face.* "Huh? Know what?"

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my voice barely above a whisper, dread coiling in the pit of my stomach.* "Hashida Suzu-san... how did she die?"
