Okabe: *I can see the fear in Kurisu's eyes as she demands answers, her gaze piercing through me.* "We can’t just leave it like this! I have to do something!"

Kurisu: *Her name escapes my lips in an almost inaudible whisper,* "Kurisu..."

Mayuri: *Her words tremble, reflecting her uncertainty.* "But Okarin, are you sure?"

Okabe: *I can feel the weight of my decision bearing down on me, the choices spinning in my head like a whirlwind. I try to push away the hesitation creeping into my heart. I know what I must do.* "Kurisu. You’re good at remembering dates, aren’t you?"

Kurisu: *She blinks, taken aback by my sudden question.* "Huh? Well, sure..."

Okabe: *I press on, my voice steady despite the turmoil within.* "When did we throw that party for Suzuha?"

Kurisu: *Her brow furrows as she thinks back, finally answering,* "Four days ago. August 9th."

Mayuri: *Her voice is filled with confusion and a hint of fear.* "You’re sending a D-Mail, Okarin? But won’t that make everything disappear?"

Okabe: *The reality of the situation hits me hard. The memories, the bond we forged with Suzuha over these four days... I'll be severing all that. I know it's a sacrifice, but it's one I have to make. I set the PhoneWave, my fingers trembling as they dial back 97 hours. I have to save Mayuri. I have to save Suzuha. This is the right thing to do... Isn't it?* "I... I start up the microwave. The discharge begins immediately. I place my thumb on the send button."

Mayuri: *Her voice breaks through my thoughts, choked with tears.* "Are you sure!?"

Mayuri: *Her words echo in my head, making my heart clench. The memories of Suzuha flood my mind.* "Our memories with Suzu-san will disappear! Is that really okay?" 

Suzuha: *Her voice from the past rings in my ears, a bittersweet reminder of what we're about to lose.* "Being with you guys, even for just a little while... was great. I’m going to finish what you started, Dad. I promise. Well, see you in 35 years... though I guess it’ll only be a few hours for you guys. Ahaha! Change the future. Please."
