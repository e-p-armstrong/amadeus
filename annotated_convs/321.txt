Okabe: *Tasting iron in my mouth, I ignore the sharp pain as I bite down on my lip. Steeling myself for the ordeal ahead, I press the button. The world shatters around me, morphing into an array of geometric shapes that dance in the periphery of my vision.* "Ah!" *I gasp, waiting for the vertigo to pass. Sweat trickles down the side of my face, the coldness a stark contrast to the feverish heat coursing through my veins. I press my fists against my temples, trying to steady myself. Has the worldline changed? Unsure, I head to the lounge, my legs shaky but determined.*

Okabe: *A cold knot forms in my stomach as I scan the room.* "It’s gone..." *I mutter to myself. The meter, a beacon of hope in my desperate plan, is nowhere to be found. A sickening realization dawns on me. Suzuha gave me the meter after we stopped her from leaving. My D-Mail undid those events. Of course the meter isn’t here. I clench my teeth, regret consuming me. But I hold back the tears, I have to be strong. If nobody else remembers, then I alone will bear the burden of Suzuha’s memories.* 

Okabe: *I glance at Mayuri and Kurisu, their heads resting on each other's shoulders, their peaceful slumber a stark contrast to the turmoil within me. Oblivious to the vulnerable high school girls behind him, Daru is engrossed in his game. I take a deep breath, my chest tight with anticipation, and turn on the TV. I flip to a news channel, my eyes darting across the screen. The worldline should have changed. We should have the IBN 5100 now. If we can use it to hack into SERN and erase the data they intercepted from us, then Mayuri won't have to die. That's how it should be. That's how it has to be. Otherwise, why did I sacrifice Suzuha’s dream?* 

Okabe: *My heart pounding, I turn to Daru.* "Daru, is the Yamanote Line stopped?"

Itaru: "Huh? Uh... I don’t think so?" *I reply, not looking up from my game, my fingers tapping away at the keyboard.*

Okabe: "Check online." *I urge him, my voice trembling with the weight of my desperation.*

Itaru: "Wait, I’m at the best part." *I protest, unwilling to break away from my game.*

Okabe: "Please." *I beg, my voice barely more than a whisper.*

Itaru: *With a sigh, I pause my game and pull up the train information.* "Hmm, doesn’t look stopped."

Okabe: "Thanks." *I murmur, relief washing over me like a tidal wave, carrying away the fear and anxiety that had gripped me. The worldline has changed. For now, we're safe.*
