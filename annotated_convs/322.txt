Okabe: *I turn away from the window, my gaze heavy with relief and weariness.* "Mayuri. Kurisu." *I call their names, my voice resounding in the still room.*

Kurisu: *I pause mid-chew, cup noodles still in my hand.* "Wait... did you just say my name correctly?" *My voice carries a tinge of astonishment, as if the familiar sound of my name from his lips is a foreign concept.*

Okabe: *I meet her gaze, my eyes steady.* "When you’re done eating, go home. It’s late, so I’ll go with you."

Mayuri: *A bright smile spreads across my face as I set down my cup.* "Okeydokey!"

Kurisu: *I scoff slightly, placing my chopsticks down and crossing my arms.* "I don’t need an escort from you. I can get back by myself."

Okabe: *I ignore her protest, my gaze turning to Daru.* "Just listen. Daru, you too."

Itaru: *I blink in surprise, my fingers pausing over the keyboard.* "Huh? Me too?"

She's here. She's alive. This, standing beside me, engrossed in her game - this is the Mayuri I'd been fighting to save. The Mayuri I'd watched die, over and over again, the image etched into my mind. But now, she's alive. This is the reality I chose, the reality I fought for, at the cost of our memories with Suzuha. I send a silent prayer to Suzuha, thanking her for her sacrifice, hoping that somewhere, somehow, she knows. I decide to seek out Suzuha the next day, to see if she remembers me in this worldline.*

Mayuri: *My eyes lift from the game, a slight blush creeping onto my cheeks as I catch Okabe's intense gaze.* "...Hey, Okarin?"

Okabe: *I blink, drawn from my thoughts.* "What?"

Mayuri: *I fidget slightly under his gaze, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Come on, Okarin... Mayushii gets nervous when you stare at her like that..."
