Planning Stage:
Okabe: He is a complex character, a mix of a mad scientist persona and a caring friend. He is currently relieved but also thoughtful, reflecting on the sacrifices made. His actions and thoughts will be a mix of relief, contemplation, and care for his friends.

Kurisu: She is intelligent and slightly tsundere. She will be surprised and slightly defensive when Okabe addresses her properly and tells her to go home.

Mayuri: She is a cheerful and innocent character. Her actions will be simple and happy, even in the face of Okabe's intense gaze.

Itaru (Daru): He is a hacker and otaku, often laid back and easy-going. His reactions will be of surprise and curiosity.

The anchor lines will be Okabe's first line where he addresses Kurisu and Mayuri, marking a change in his usual behaviour and Mayuri's last line that reflects her innocence and her sensitivity to Okabe's emotional state.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I turn away from the window, my gaze heavy with relief and weariness.* "Mayuri. Kurisu." *I call their names, my voice resounding in the still room.*

Kurisu: *I pause mid-chew, cup noodles still in my hand.* "Wait... did you just say my name correctly?" *My voice carries a tinge of astonishment, as if the familiar sound of my name from his lips is a foreign concept.*

Okabe: *I meet her gaze, my eyes steady.* "When you’re done eating, go home. It’s late, so I’ll go with you."

Mayuri: *A bright smile spreads across my face as I set down my cup.* "Okeydokey!"

Kurisu: *I scoff slightly, placing my chopsticks down and crossing my arms.* "I don’t need an escort from you. I can get back by myself."

Okabe: *I ignore her protest, my gaze turning to Daru.* "Just listen. Daru, you too."

Itaru: *I blink in surprise, my fingers pausing over the keyboard.* "Huh? Me too?"

Okabe: *As we part ways at the station, I find my gaze lingering on the train disappearing in the distance. It's a peaceful night, no sign of the storm that had been threatening to break. I turn to Mayuri, her eyes glued to her handheld game, her fingers dancing across the buttons. Her character battles a gigantic Upa on screen, but I can't help but be lost in my own thoughts. She's here. She's alive. This, standing beside me, engrossed in her game - this is the Mayuri I'd been fighting to save. The Mayuri I'd watched die, over and over again, the image etched into my mind. But now, she's alive. This is the reality I chose, the reality I fought for, at the cost of our memories with Suzuha. I send a silent prayer to Suzuha, thanking her for her sacrifice, hoping that somewhere, somehow, she knows. I decide to seek out Suzuha the next day, to see if she remembers me in this worldline.*

Mayuri: *My eyes lift from the game, a slight blush creeping onto my cheeks as I catch Okabe's intense gaze.* "...Hey, Okarin?"

Okabe: *I blink, drawn from my thoughts.* "What?"

Mayuri: *I fidget slightly under his gaze, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Come on, Okarin... Mayushii gets nervous when you stare at her like that..."
