Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my brows furrowing as I look at Okabe, a hint of concern in my voice.* "Yeah."

Okabe: *I offer a quick nod and a lopsided smile, my eyes betraying my unease.* "Sorry about that."

Mayuri: *I continue to study him, my fingers hesitating over the game in my hand.* "There’s something different about you today, Okarin."

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by her observation, my voice rising in surprise.* "R-really?"

Mayuri: *I nod, my eyes searching his.* "Yeah. What’s wrong?"

Okabe: *I chuckle, trying to brush off her concern, putting on my best mad scientist persona.* "Heh. Nothing’s wrong! And I wasn’t looking at you just now. I was devising new ways to bring chaos to the world. Muhahaha!"

Mayuri: *I give him a skeptical look, my voice soft but persistent.* "Really? You seem kind of tired."

Okabe: *I puff out my chest, injecting a dose of bravado into my tone.* "A mad scientist is never tired. The mighty gray cells of my 170-IQ brain are always performing calculations, day and night!"

Tennouji: *I emerge from the workshop, rubbing my eyes against the morning sun.* "Okabe! You’ve got free time. How about a job? As a special offer, I’ll hire you for one CRT a month."

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, crossing my arms in mock indignation.* "When did Suzuha quit, again?"

Tennouji: *I scratch my head, my brows furrowing in confusion.* "Suzuha? Who the hell’s that?"

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest, my mind racing to make sense of his words.* "I ain’t got time to remember the name of some lazy part-timer who quit after just ten days."

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, clenching my fists at my sides, my voice laced with frustration.* "Damn you and your misleading words..."
