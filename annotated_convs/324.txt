Mayuri: *I emerge from the ticket gate, walking with an unhurried stride towards Okabe.* "Tutturu♪ I didn’t think you’d come all the way to the station to pick me up. Mayushii’s surprised!"

Okabe: *I chuckle, playing along with her innocence.* "I wouldn’t want my hostage to get away."

Mayuri: *I giggle, twirling around in delight.* "Yeah, me neither! So, Mayushii’s really happy. Ehehe♪"

Okabe: *I watch her, her carefree smile tugging at my heartstrings. As she skips ahead of me, I can't help but feel a sense of unease.* 

Mayuri: *I glance back at Okabe, my eyes landing on the bag he's holding.* "So what’s in the bag?"

Okabe: "Mister Braun gave it to me. It’s a device that can measure the divergence of worldlines."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, puzzled.* "Wow, that sounds amazing... what’s a worldline?"

Okabe: *I smile wryly, shaking my head at her innocence.* "Mayuri, you really are a dummy."

Okabe: *My heart clenches as I remember the image of her lifeless body, the memory still fresh in my mind.* "Just a thought, Mayuri, but don’t you think maybe you should stop coming to Akiba for a while? At least until ComiMa ends."

Okabe: *I glance to the side, expecting a response. But Mayuri is nowhere to be found.* "Mayuri!?" 

Okabe: *Frantic, my gaze scans the area until I find her wandering towards a newly-opened shaved ice stand. My heart sinks. Can't she see how worried I am?* 

Kurisu: *I lean against the lab's wall, an iced coffee in my hand, watching Okabe with a scrutinizing gaze.* "So you’re the devoted type, huh?"

Okabe: *I look up from the computer, my search for the elusive IBN 5100 momentarily forgotten.* "What’s that supposed to mean?"

Kurisu: "All of a sudden, you’re treating Mayuri like a princess. Today you went to the station to meet her, you taste tested her lunch, and then you held her hand all the way back to the lab."

Mayuri: *I giggle, clapping my hands together in delight.* "Okarin really loves Mayushii! Ehehe!"
