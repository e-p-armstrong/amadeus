Planning Stage:

In this scene, we have three characters: Okabe, Mayuri, and Kurisu. 

Okabe is a bit eccentric and dramatic, often acting out his 'mad scientist' persona. However, beneath this facade, he's genuinely caring and protective, especially towards Mayuri. This scene shows his worry and anxiety about Mayuri's safety, which should be reflected in his *actions* and *thoughts*. His language would be more formal and grandiose, fitting his character.

Mayuri is a cheerful, innocent, and somewhat air-headed character. She doesn't fully understand the dangers around her, and this naïveté should be reflected in her *actions*. Her *actions* would be more carefree and bubbly, reflecting her cheerful personality.

Kurisu is a more serious and focused character, with a bit of a tsundere side. She's observant and would often have a sarcastic or witty retort ready. Her *actions* would be more restrained and precise, fitting her scientific mind.

Anchor Lines:
1. Okabe: "Just a thought, Mayuri, but don’t you think maybe you should stop coming to Akiba for a while? At least until ComiMa ends."
2. Kurisu: "All of a sudden, you’re treating Mayuri like a princess. Today you went to the station to meet her, you taste tested her lunch, and then you held her hand all the way back to the lab."

Roleplay:

Mayuri: *I emerge from the ticket gate, walking with an unhurried stride towards Okabe.* "Tutturu♪ I didn’t think you’d come all the way to the station to pick me up. Mayushii’s surprised!"

Okabe: *I chuckle, playing along with her innocence.* "I wouldn’t want my hostage to get away."

Mayuri: *I giggle, twirling around in delight.* "Yeah, me neither! So, Mayushii’s really happy. Ehehe♪"

Okabe: *I watch her, her carefree smile tugging at my heartstrings. As she skips ahead of me, I can't help but feel a sense of unease.* 

Mayuri: *I glance back at Okabe, my eyes landing on the bag he's holding.* "So what’s in the bag?"

Okabe: "Mister Braun gave it to me. It’s a device that can measure the divergence of worldlines."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, puzzled.* "Wow, that sounds amazing... what’s a worldline?"

Okabe: *I smile wryly, shaking my head at her innocence.* "Mayuri, you really are a dummy."

Okabe: *My heart clenches as I remember the image of her lifeless body, the memory still fresh in my mind.* "Just a thought, Mayuri, but don’t you think maybe you should stop coming to Akiba for a while? At least until ComiMa ends."

Okabe: *I glance to the side, expecting a response. But Mayuri is nowhere to be found.* "Mayuri!?" 

Okabe: *Frantic, my gaze scans the area until I find her wandering towards a newly-opened shaved ice stand. My heart sinks. Can't she see how worried I am?* 

Kurisu: *I lean against the lab's wall, an iced coffee in my hand, watching Okabe with a scrutinizing gaze.* "So you’re the devoted type, huh?"

Okabe: *I look up from the computer, my search for the elusive IBN 5100 momentarily forgotten.* "What’s that supposed to mean?"

Kurisu: "All of a sudden, you’re treating Mayuri like a princess. Today you went to the station to meet her, you taste tested her lunch, and then you held her hand all the way back to the lab."

Mayuri: *I giggle, clapping my hands together in delight.* "Okarin really loves Mayushii! Ehehe!"
