Okabe: *I furrow my brows, the flickering fluorescent light above casting a harsh glow on my confusion.* "I don’t follow."

Kurisu: *Her hands folded neatly on her lap, she shoots me a questioning glance, her eyes hinting at her curiosity.* "Are you a couple or what? I’ve been meaning to ask."

Okabe: *I chuckle, a dry, humorless sound that echoes around the empty lab.* "Do we look like a couple?"

Kurisu: *Caught off guard, she stutters, her cheeks flushing a soft pink.* "Huh!? Uh... well... umm..."

*I can't help but smirk, wondering what sort of delusions this girl has.*

Mayuri: *Her eyes twinkle with a childish innocence as she chimes in.* "You know, Okarin and Mayushii have been friends since we were little♪ Mwawoohii’s weeally hwawy nawo."

Okabe: *I shake my head, a light chuckle escaping my lips.* "Don’t talk with your mouth full."

Kurisu: *She shifts in her seat, her gaze darting away as she mumbles under her breath.* "So... you’re not a couple. Oh. Well, of course! No one would willingly date Okabe, after all."

Okabe: *I scoff, my arms crossed over my chest in feigned indignation.* "Pff. You disappoint me, Christina!"

Kurisu: *She blinks, her confusion palpable.* "Hah? What are you talking about?"

Okabe: *I can't help but burst into laughter, my voice echoing around the room. I point a finger at her, my grin wide.* "You have finally revealed your true nature. I saw how your eyes lit up at the first hint of romance! You’re nothing but a filthy mainstream girl! I bet you like to eat chocolate with your girlfriends and giggle about the latest celebrity love affair! Absurd! This lab has no need of the puppies and flowers in your head!"

*As the echoes of my laughter die down, a strange feeling washes over me. It feels strange to be spewing this chuunibyou nonsense again, after what I’ve been through. Is my innocence lost forever?*

Kurisu: *She rolls her eyes, her arms crossed over her chest as she fires back.* "What the hell are you on about, you self-proclaimed mad scientist chuunibyou nutcase?"

*A pang of loneliness hits me. It’s been a long time since I argued with Kurisu like this too. After failing to save Mayuri, I sought help from this genius girl. Even though her words were at times harsh, she supported and encouraged me to the end. But now, all of that has vanished along with the time we spent with Suzuha. I silently give her my sincere gratitude.*

Okabe: *I turn away from them, my fingers dancing over the X68000’s keyboard. With a heavy sigh, I glance at the divergence meter sitting on the shelf. The display reads 0. 409431%. What does that mean?*

Suzuha: *Her voice cuts through the silence, her words heavy with meaning.* "The universe is like this piece of yarn. Countless possible worldlines exist side by side, branching out to infinity. When the meter reads over 1%, you’ve made it to the Beta worldline. If you escape the Alpha attractor field and reach the Beta worldline... then the result will change. Reach 1% divergence... and you’ll save Shiina Mayuri."
