Kurisu: *I step into the development room, my eyes quickly scanning the area, noting the hum of the Time Leap Machine.* "Didn’t you say we weren’t going to experiment with the Time Leap Machine?" *I ask, my voice steady but filled with concern.*

Okabe: *I turn to face Kurisu, my fingers drumming nervously on the tabletop.* "This is just in case." *I say, my voice echoing around the empty lab.*

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow at Okabe's vague response, my mind racing with unanswered questions.* "In case what?" *I press, my voice sharper than intended.*

Okabe: *I struggle to answer, my gaze locked on the Time Leap Machine. A silent prayer forms in my mind: Please let Mayuri be safe. Please don’t let anything happen. The door slams open, interrupting my thoughts. My heart freezes as I recognize the men who burst into the lab - the Rounders. I can only watch in horror as they aim their guns at us. A sense of despair washes over me, my worst fears realized. It’s happening exactly the same as before.*

Attacker A: *I stride into the room, my eyes cold and ruthless.* "Hands in the air. Nobody move." *I command, my voice echoing through the lab.*

Mayuri: *I peek out from the hallway, my eyes wide with confusion and fear as I spot the unfamiliar men. I recognize one face among them and my voice trembles as I call out.* "Um... Moeka-san?"
