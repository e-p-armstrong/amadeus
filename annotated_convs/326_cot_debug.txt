Planning Stage:

Characters:

1. Okabe: He's the protagonist, a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He's theatrical, dramatic, and often acts larger than life. However, beneath this persona, he's deeply caring and protective of his friends. His thoughts should be dramatic, filled with a sense of dread, fear, and determination. His actions should be bold and commanding. His anchor line will be his silence in response to Kurisu's question, which will be transformed into an action that reflects his internal struggle and fear.

2. Kurisu: She's a genius scientist who often acts as the voice of reason. She's logical and straightforward, but she also cares deeply about her friends. Her lines should reflect her analytical nature and concern. Her actions should be precise, controlled, and thoughtful.

3. Mayuri: She's a sweet, innocent, and cheerful girl. She's often oblivious to the more serious events happening around her. Her actions should be simple, innocent, and filled with a sense of child-like wonder.

4. Attacker A: He's a faceless villain, an agent of an ominous organization. His words should be cold, ruthless, and threatening. His actions should be intimidating and forceful.

Anchor Lines:

1. Okabe's silence in response to Kurisu's question. This will be transformed into a powerful action that reveals his dread, fear, and determination.

Thematic Direction: 

The scene is filled with tension, suspense, and fear. The writing should reflect this, gradually building up the tension and then suddenly releasing it with the arrival of the attackers. The focus will be on Okabe's internal struggle and fear for Mayuri's safety.

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I step into the development room, my eyes quickly scanning the area, noting the hum of the Time Leap Machine.* "Didn’t you say we weren’t going to experiment with the Time Leap Machine?" *I ask, my voice steady but filled with concern.*

Okabe: *I turn to face Kurisu, my fingers drumming nervously on the tabletop.* "This is just in case." *I say, my voice echoing around the empty lab.*

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow at Okabe's vague response, my mind racing with unanswered questions.* "In case what?" *I press, my voice sharper than intended.*

Okabe: *I struggle to answer, my gaze locked on the Time Leap Machine. A silent prayer forms in my mind: Please let Mayuri be safe. Please don’t let anything happen. The door slams open, interrupting my thoughts. My heart freezes as I recognize the men who burst into the lab - the Rounders. I can only watch in horror as they aim their guns at us. A sense of despair washes over me, my worst fears realized. It’s happening exactly the same as before.*

Attacker A: *I stride into the room, my eyes cold and ruthless.* "Hands in the air. Nobody move." *I command, my voice echoing through the lab.*

Mayuri: *I peek out from the hallway, my eyes wide with confusion and fear as I spot the unfamiliar men. I recognize one face among them and my voice trembles as I call out.* "Um... Moeka-san?"
