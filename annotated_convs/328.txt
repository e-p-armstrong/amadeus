Okabe: *I guide Kurisu out of the lab, my steps heavy with the weight of our situation. We settle on the bench in front of the building, the absence of Suzuha’s bicycle a sharp reminder of our loss.* "What is it? You don’t normally say my name normally."

Kurisu: *I frown at my own words, a hint of confusion creeping into my voice.* "That came out weird."

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my hands clenched tightly in my lap.* "Please... help me."

Kurisu: *Surprise flashes across my face, replaced quickly by concern.* "...Now this is a shock. I never thought I’d hear those words from you. Do you have a fever?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, my eyes pleading.* "No jokes. I seriously need your help."

Kurisu: *I search Okabe's face for a moment, before realization dawns on me.* "You time leaped, didn’t you?"

Okabe: *I nod, my gaze never leaving Kurisu's face.* "How much do you know?"

Kurisu: *I furrow my brows, a hint of uncertainty in my voice.* "How much do I know about what?"

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, bracing myself for her reaction.* "How about Suzuha being John Titor?"

Kurisu: *I blink at Okabe, my mind racing to process this new information.* "Eh!?"

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu gives me a blank stare, her confusion mirrored in my own thoughts. When we prevented Suzuha from leaving on August 9th, she ended up staying until August 13th. But that outcome was changed by my last D-Mail. What happened during those four days on this worldline?* "Have you finished the Time Leap Machine?"

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, puzzled.* "What are you talking about? I finished it yesterday after an all-nighter, remember? When did you leap from?"

Okabe: *I run a hand through my hair, sighing heavily.* "8 PM tonight."

Kurisu: *I lean back on the bench, my mind working overtime to piece everything together.* "Hmmm..."

Okabe: *I start to explain everything. I tell her about Mayuri’s many deaths, and about what happened with Suzuha and Moeka. I also give a summary of what Suzuha told me about the structure of the universe. Kurisu does not appear to doubt my story.*

Kurisu: *I nod slowly, my gaze focused on Okabe.* "So basically, you win if you get the IBN 5100 back."

Okabe: *I nod at Kurisu's summary, a hint of relief washing over me.*

Kurisu: *I tap my fingers on the bench, lost in thought.* "This is just a guess... But maybe you should look at what Amane-san said from the opposite angle. I think the critical change takes place when you get the IBN 5100 and erase the data in SERN’s database. That instant is most likely when you’ll achieve divergence over 1%."

Okabe: *I frown, my mind racing.* "The problem is where the IBN 5100 is now."

Kurisu: *I glance at Okabe, a faint smile on my lips.* "You’ve already found it once. That is, if your memories are real. If you can get back to the worldline where you first obtained it, then isn’t it bound to return to you?"

Okabe: *A spark of hope ignites within me.* "I see... You’re right. The IBN 5100 was at the lab, and then it suddenly disappeared."

Kurisu: *I laugh softly, the tension breaking for a moment.* "You threw a fit about that earlier. I remember thinking, ’Oh god, Okabe’s finally lost his ability to distinguish fantasy from reality.’"

Okabe: *I smirk at Kurisu's teasing.* "You’re such a wannabe American. What do you mean, ’oh god’? Oh, I get it. Chris-chan is a Chris-tian."

Kurisu: *I shoot Okabe a disdainful look, my lips pursing in distaste.* "That’s terrible."

Okabe: *I wince, immediately regretting the poor joke.* "...I regret it too."

Okabe: *I straighten up, pushing aside the momentary distraction.* "So, Christina... let me see if I understand what you’re saying. The changes we made to the worldline -- namely, all of the D-Mails we’ve sent -- must be reversed. That will return us to the worldline where I found the IBN 5100 at Yanabayashi Shrine."
