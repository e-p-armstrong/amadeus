Okabe: *I tilt my head to the side, my brows knitting together in confusion.* Why is she getting mad at me? I just don’t understand her.

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, a faint blush creeping up my cheeks.* "I wish I could remember too... Then I’d always have something to rub your nose in!" *My words come out sharper than intended, my own frustration seeping through.*

Okabe: *I scoff, shaking my head in disbelief.* "You really have an awful personality."

Kurisu: *I narrow my eyes at him, my retort coming out almost instantly.* "You’re one to talk."

Okabe: *With that, I step towards the machine, the gears of time churning beneath my feet. I leap 28 hours into the past. Time leap complete. I find myself back in the lab, as usual. My brain feels like it’s been pinched, a dull throbbing at the back of my skull. I endure the pain as I glance at my watch. It’s 1:47 PM. Kurisu’s almost done with the Time Leap Machine, and Mayuri’s almost done with Lukako’s costume. They should both be done in about 10 minutes. I leave the lab, the sterile scent of machinery giving way to the fresh outdoor air as I sit on the bench in front of the Braun Tube Workshop. I close my eyes, going over the plan in my head. Cancel all the D-Mails that have changed the past so far. Of course, that includes D-Mails sent by people other than me. Specifically, I’m only concerned with the D-Mails that triggered Reading Steiner. We sent several of them as experiments. For example, Operation Urd Stage Two, the LOTO SIX experiment, involved one such D-Mail. But the real problem is what other people sent. Mayuri and Kurisu haven’t sent any D-Mails. Daru sent his past self a strategy to win the Faris Cup, but Reading Steiner didn’t activate, so divergence must not have changed. That leaves three D-Mails to deal with -- those sent by Moeka, Lukako, and Faris. The most problematic is the one Faris sent, which is also the most recent. I have no idea what it said, so I don’t know how to cancel it. Faris’s D-Mail caused a dramatic change to Akiba. All of the moe stores disappeared. That’s my only hint. I’m the only one who remembers how things were before the change, so I won’t get an answer from Faris, even if I ask her directly. But still, I have to at least try. I should get in touch with her. First, let’s try contacting her by phone or mail. Meeting face-to-face would be best, but MayQueen doesn’t exist on this worldline. Meaning I’d have to go to that high-class apartment complex. I should try contacting Faris first. I pull out my phone, my fingers hovering over the screen as I decide to call her. The ring tone echoes in my ears, a haunting reminder of the distance between us. It’s not connecting.*

Okabe: *A sigh escapes me, the sound lost in the bustling city around me.* "Damn!" *The word is harsh, echoing my frustration and the overwhelming weight of my mission.*
