Planning Stage:

Characters involved:
1. Okabe: The protagonist of Steins;Gate. He's intelligent, paranoid, and often dramatic. He has a deep sense of responsibility towards those around him. His actions will be filled with anxiety, urgency, and determination.

2. Butler: Professional, polite, and unyielding. His actions will be formal and restrained.

3. Itaru: A laid-back, somewhat geeky character who's good with computers. He tends to be relaxed and nonchalant, even in stressful situations. His actions will be casual, filled with nerdy references and lingo.

Lines that will be anchors:
- Okabe: "Daru, do you happen to know where Faris is right now?"
- Okabe: "Just tell me where she is! You keep tabs on her at all times, don’t you!?"

Thematic direction: The scene focuses on Okabe's desperate search for Faris. It's filled with tension and urgency. The anchor lines reflect Okabe's desperation and his reliance on his friends.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I lean forward, my hands clutching at the counter as I speak, my voice hoarse with desperation.* "Then where is she now?"

Butler: *I straighten my back, maintaining a professional demeanor.* "I’m afraid I cannot answer that. You may be someone with whom she does not wish to interact."

Okabe: *I slam my hand on the counter, my heart pounding in my chest.* "I’ve been here before, remember!?"

Butler: *I take a step back, unfazed by the outburst.* "Of course, sir. However, I still cannot disclose the location of the young mistress. Please contact her directly."

Okabe: *I sense him trying to end the conversation, my pulse quickens as I rush to get the last word in.* "P-please wait! I’ve been trying to get in touch with Faris, but she’s not returning my calls or emails!"

Butler: *I bow slightly, a polite smile on my face that doesn't reach my eyes.* "Then please try again some other time."

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, my hand clenching into a fist.* "Guh!"

Itaru: *I answer my phone, the sounds of a bustling crowd in the background.* "Yeah? Okarin?"

Okabe: *I glance around, the bustling cityscape a blur around me as I focus on the call.* "Daru, do you happen to know where Faris is right now?"

Itaru: *I scratch my head, trying to make sense of the sudden urgency.* "Faris-tan?"

Okabe: *I pace anxiously, my shoes clicking against the pavement.* "I need to talk to her right now!"

Itaru: *I chuckle, brushing some crumbs off my shirt.* "Right now? That’s not gonna happen."

Okabe: *I stop in my tracks, frustration gnawing at me.* "Just tell me where she is! You keep tabs on her at all times, don’t you!?"

Itaru: *I tilt my head, considering the question.* "I know where she is, sure."

Okabe: *I grip the phone tighter, my voice coming out in a near shout.* "Where!? Where is she!?"

Itaru: *I take a deep breath, trying to calm Okabe down.* "In the UPX assembly hall."

Okabe: *I look up, my heart pounding as I see the UPX building looming over me.* "Why the assembly hall?"

Itaru: *I roll my eyes, surprised at Okabe's lack of knowledge.* "Today’s the finals of the RaiNet AB GC."

Okabe: "RaiNet AB GC?"

Itaru: *I laugh, the sounds of the crowd growing louder.* "Short for RaiNet AccessBattlers Grand Championship, duh. It’s the finals, man. Faris is participating. Faris-tan was the winner of this year’s winter GC, so she’s the defending champion. Just so you know."

Okabe: *I stand still, the realization hitting me like a ton of bricks.* "She’s... in the finals?"

Itaru: *I nod, even though Okabe can't see me.* "I’m here too, spectating. The match has already started, man."

Okabe: *I start moving again, determination filling me.* "I’m headed there now. What floor!?"

Itaru: *I frown, concern creeping into my voice.* "Do you have a ticket?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, even though Daru can't see me.* "No, but I’ll manage!"

Itaru: *I sigh, knowing Okabe's stubbornness all too well.* "I don’t know, man. Security’s pretty tight. Someone posted threats on @channel. Pretty sure you’re not getting in."

Okabe: *I stop, my heart sinking.* "Then you come out. I’m in front of UPX. Can you lend me your ticket?"

Itaru: *I shake my head, trying to reason with him.* "No way. It’ll end at four, so can’t you just wait until then?"

Okabe: *I feel a surge of desperation, my voice echoing in the empty street.* "H-hey! Daru! Daru! Gh...!"
