Planning Stage:

In this scene, Okabe is trying to unravel a mystery about a time-altering event that only he seems to remember. He's desperate to understand and fix it, but is struggling to communicate the situation to Faris, who is currently emotionally distraught after losing a championship match. Okabe is portrayed as analytical and persistent, while Faris is depicted as lively and eccentric, but currently in a state of distress.

For Okabe, I'll use precise, thoughtful language and add actions that reveal his determination and frustration. For Faris, I'll use more whimsical and emotive language, and actions that highlight her current vulnerability and confusion.

The anchor lines for this scene will be Okabe's questions about the time machine and D-Mail, and Faris's response. I will emphasize the desperation and urgency in Okabe's lines, and the confusion and melancholy in Faris's responses.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *As I watch the bald man and his lackeys bristle at my scientific truths, I sense the danger.* "This doesn’t look good." *I decide it's time to avoid a fight and make a hasty retreat.* 

Okabe: *Afterwards, I head to the assembly hall, querying the staff about Faris. With no luck, I try calling Daru, only to be met with disappointment in his voice.* "Maybe she went home already?" *With a sigh, I return to Faris’s apartment building and press the intercom.*

Butler: *After a moment, the butler's voice filters through the speaker.* "May I ask who’s calling?"

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my heart pounding in my chest.* "It’s Okabe. Has Fari... has Rumiho-san returned?"

Butler: "...Just a moment."

Okabe: *I feel a glimmer of hope as the intercom goes silent. Then, with a mechanical click, the door’s automatic lock opens, granting me access to the elevator hall.*

Butler: "Please come up, sir. The young mistress will see you."

Okabe: *With a nod of gratitude to the unseen butler, I hurry into the elevator and head up.*

Okabe: *Once inside the apartment, I see Faris sitting on the sofa, hugging her knees. Her usual vivacious energy is nowhere to be seen.* "Faris! Finally. There’s something I need to ask you."

Faris: "Hmmya..."

Okabe: *I look at her, really look at her. She's a shell of her usual self, drained and tired.* "What happened? You look down."

Faris: *She speaks in a small voice, her words tumbling out in a rush.* "This can’t be happening, nya. Why did Faris have to lose, nyan? If only those guys hadn’t used underhanded tricks on me, nya... They ganged up on Faris... I even promised Papa I’d win... he’s probably disappointed in me, nya... I’m too ashamed to show my face, nya..."

Okabe: *Her words hit me like a punch to the gut. So that's why she's been hiding. I feel a pang of sympathy for Faris, but I don't have time to console her.* "Listen, Faris!"

Okabe: *I reach out, gripping her shoulders. Her eyes blink open, but they're glazed over, empty.* "A couple of days ago, you used the time machine we invented to send a D-Mail. Do you remember that?"

Faris: "Hanya?"

Okabe: *I let out a frustrated sigh. I knew this would be difficult.* "Let’s say, for example, that there used to be tons of stores for anime otaku here in Akiba. And let’s say you used a time machine, and changed that Akiba into the electric town it is today. How would you do it?"

Faris: *She murmurs, her expression blank, lost.* "Time... machine..."

Faris: "Time machine..."
