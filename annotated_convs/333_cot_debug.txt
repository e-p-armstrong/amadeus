Planning Stage:
Characters involved:
1. Okabe: The protagonist and a self-proclaimed mad scientist. His personality is eccentric and dramatic. He often feigns confidence but is easily flustered, especially in emotional situations. He is also highly perceptive and analytical.
2. Faris: She is a playful and optimistic character with a catgirl persona. She frequently uses cat-like expressions and gestures. She is also very persuasive and manipulative.

Their archetypes/personalities will be reflected in their dialogue, actions, and thoughts. Okabe's internal monologue will be analytical and slightly paranoid, while Faris will be depicted as playful and emotional. 

Anchor Lines:
1. Faris: "My head... hurts, nya."
2. Faris: "Even though Faris is trying her bestest to remember for you... You called me a liar... it hurts, nyan."

Thematic Direction: The scene will be emotionally charged, focusing on the confusion, desperation, and emotional turmoil felt by both characters. It will also highlight the underlying tension and uncertainty surrounding the time machine.

Roleplay:
Okabe: *She presses herself against me, catching me off guard.* "W-whoa! What!?" *Her scent fills my nostrils, a pleasant combination of shampoo and something uniquely Faris. I feel her cat ears tickling my nose and I stiffen, unsure how to react to this sudden intimacy. Her eyes, usually filled with playful mischief, now shimmer with desperation.*

Faris: *Her voice is barely above a whisper.* "Is it a real time machine, nya?"

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my throat suddenly dry.* "...Yeah. It’s real."

Faris: *She peers at me, her gaze intense and probing.* "I believe you, nyan."

Okabe: *I'm taken aback by her sudden declaration of trust. She then begins clutching her head, her brows furrowing in pain.*

Faris: "Ugh... ugh... I’m about to remember, nya."

Okabe: "Huh?" *I blink at her in confusion.*

Faris: *Her voice is shaky, but there's a determination in her eyes.* "Faris remembers using the time machine, nyan."

Okabe: "Wha... Really!?" *My pulse quickens at her words.*

Faris: *She nods, her eyes slightly glassy.* "Umm, Faris got on the time machine and it went zoom and..."

Okabe: "What? But you didn’t ride anything, you sent a D-Mail to the past."

Faris: *She shakes her head, her eyes wide and frantic.* "Nyanya! That’s it, nya, I’m starting to remember more and more, nya."

Okabe: *She grips her head tighter, her face contorting in pain. Tears well up in her eyes and my heart clenches at the sight.*

Faris: "My head... hurts, nya." *Her voice is so small, so vulnerable. It's a stark contrast to the usual playful Faris.*

Okabe: "What’s going on here?" *I'm at a loss, my mind racing to make sense of the situation.*

Faris: *She clings to me, her slender frame trembling. Her warmth seeps into me, grounding me in this chaotic moment.* "Kyouma... Faris is... Faris is..."

Okabe: *Her words hang in the air, unfinished and heavy with unspoken fear. I hold her closer, trying to offer some semblance of comfort.*

Faris: "My brains are turning to mush, nya..." *She mumbles into my chest.*

Okabe: "Hang in there! Is there anything I can do?"

Faris: "If I win... If I win, I might remember, nya."

Okabe: "Win? Win what?" *I frown, confused by her sudden shift in topic.*

Faris: "Today’s match, nyan. Against the Viral Attackers, nya. I only lost because of their underhanded tricks, nya. And now my head is all mushy, so I can’t remember anything, nya. Please, Kyouma... I think that if I win the match, I’ll remember everything, nya. So please, nyan, let me use the time machine."

Okabe: "By the way, this isn’t an act, right?" *I look at her skeptically, unable to shake off my suspicion.*

Faris: *Her eyes widen, taken aback by my accusation.* "A-an act? What do you mean, nya?"

Okabe: *I sigh, rubbing the back of my neck. It's just too plausible, considering her manipulative nature.*

Faris: *She looks at me, hurt evident in her eyes.* "You’re awful, nya."

Okabe: *She buries her face into my chest, her body shaking with silent sobs. The guilt gnaws at me.*

Faris: "Even though Faris is trying her bestest to remember for you... You called me a liar... it hurts, nyan." *Her words, muffled by my shirt, hit me like a punch to the gut.*

Okabe: "Ah, no, I’m sorry." *I whisper, my voice filled with regret.*
