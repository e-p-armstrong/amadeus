Faris: *I lean in close, my breath fanning gently across Okabe's ear as I whisper,* "Help Faris win, nyan..."

Okabe: *My heart hammers in my chest, and a shudder ripples through me as I feel a warm, wet sensation on my earlobe. I can feel Faris' teeth brushing against my ear, an electric shock coursing through my body.* "W-wait! I get it! I get it, okay!?" *In a panic, I pull away, my mind racing. That was too close. I could have lost control.*

Okabe: *My voice trembling slightly, I manage to stutter,* "O-okay, Faris. We’ll do it your way."

Faris: *Her eyes widen in surprise, a glimmer of hope flashing in them.* "Fur real, nyan!?"

Okabe: "Yeah. I need you to remember, whatever it takes." *I'm determined, my voice steady now.*

Faris: *She springs forward, her arms outstretched, but I sidestep quickly, causing her to face dive into the sofa.* "Hnnya... why’d you dodge, nya?"

Okabe: "Um... You’re being way too familiar." *I rub the back of my neck nervously, trying to regain my composure. I can't shake the feeling that I'm being played here. But I need to help her win, no matter what.*

Okabe: *With newfound determination, I speak,* "I’m going to leap to this morning and give you some advice that will allow you to win. How’s that?"

Faris: "We’re not sending a mail, nyan?" *She asks, her eyes filled with curiosity.*

Okabe: "Our lab has developed a device for time leaping, or sending your consciousness to the past." *I explain, hoping that she understands the gravity of the situation.*

Faris: "Awesome! So it’s like New Game+, nya?" *She seems excited, but I can't let her get carried away.*

Okabe: "Umm, yeah, that’s it." *I agree reluctantly, knowing I shouldn't play along.*

Faris: "So if Faris uses it to go back to this morning, it’ll solve everything, nya!" *Her voice is filled with hope, but I have to burst her bubble.*

Okabe: "You can’t!" *I blurt out, my tone firm.*

Faris: "Nya!? Why not, nyan?" *She looks at me, confusion clear on her face.*

Okabe: "I can’t let anyone else use the Time Leap Machine." *I explain, hoping she understands.*

Faris: "No fair, nya." *She pouts, clearly disappointed.*

Okabe: "It’s not something to be used lightly. It’s dangerous." *I say, trying to drill the seriousness of the situation into her.*

Okabe: "I’ll be the one responsible for changing the past. Trust me, Faris." *I look at her, my gaze steady and serious.*

Faris: "...Okay, nya." *She finally concedes, her voice soft.*

Okabe: "Guh..." *I let out a sigh of relief, feeling the weight of the world on my shoulders.*
