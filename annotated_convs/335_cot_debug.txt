Brainstorming/Planning:

In this scene, Okabe is trying to convince Faris to take his advice so she can win the upcoming tournament. He has to navigate her quirky personality and her initial disbelief of his time-traveling claims. 

- Okabe: He is a serious and intense character, often overly dramatic due to his chuunibyou personality. However, in this scene, he is more somber and straightforward due to the urgency of the situation. His actions will be more focused and direct, and his thoughts will reflect his determination and concern for Faris's success.
- Faris: She is playful, cheerful, and often speaks in a cutesy, cat-like manner. Despite this, she is also shown to be perceptive and caring. Her actions will often be playful or teasing, and her dialogue will reflect her unique speech patterns.

Anchor Lines:
1. Okabe: "I’m not joking around here! I seriously leapt here from six this evening! I know the outcome of today’s RaiNet GC final."
2. Okabe: "But that’s only because of the opposing team’s interference. So to protect you, I brought you these sunglasses and earplugs."

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I meander through the bustling crowd, my mind a whirlwind of thoughts and doubts. I clutch onto the sunglasses and earplugs I bought on the way here, their physicality grounding me amidst my internal turmoil.* "I wonder if she's right... No, now's not the time to doubt." *I reaffirm to myself, steadying my resolve. The clock is ticking, and I have a mission to accomplish.*

Okabe: *As I approach the participant entrance of the assembly hall, I spot Faris making her way towards me. She's clad in her usual cat ears and maid uniform, a sight that feels strangely out of place in this worldline. Upon noticing me, her eyes widen in surprise.* 

Faris: "Kyouma, what are you doing here, nya?" *She asks, her cat-like tone lilting with curiosity.*

Okabe: "I waited here because I wanted to see you." *I reply, my tone uncharacteristically serious.*

Faris: "Hanya!? A-are you confessing your love for me? I don’t know what to do if you confess right before such an important match, nyan!" *She stammers, her eyes twinkling with mischief.*

Okabe: "D-don’t be ridiculous! Why would I confess to you?" *I retort, my face heating up at her insinuation.*

Faris: "...You’re awfully serious today, nya. Usually you play along more, nya." *She remarks, her playful smile fading slightly.*

Okabe: *I don't have time to play along today.* "Please just listen to me, Faris! This is important for your victory." *I implore, my voice heavy with urgency.*

Faris: "Important? But you don’t even know the rules of RaiNet, nya?" *She counters, her eyebrows furrowing in confusion.*

Okabe: "It’s not about the rules or anything like that." *I respond, my gaze unwavering.*

Faris: "Then what is it, nya?" *She peers at me with questioning eyes, her curiosity piqued.*

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, mustering the courage to relay my message.* "Take these with you." *I extend my hand, offering her the sunglasses and earplugs.*

Faris: "Kyouma... that’s lame, nya..." *She recoils, her eyes flicking between me and the items in my hand.*

Okabe: "It’s not a present. These are countermeasures!" *I retort, my determination unwavering.*

Faris: "Nya?" *She tilts her head, clearly taken aback.*

Okabe: *I hesitate, my heart pounding against my chest.* "Listen good. I came from the future."

Faris: "I know, nya." *She responds nonchalantly.*

Okabe: "What!?" *I exclaim, my heart skipping a beat. How could she possibly know?*

Faris: "And Faris came from space, nya." *She adds, her playful smile returning.*

Okabe: *I shake my head, trying to regain my composure.* "I’m not joking around here! I seriously leapt here from six this evening! I know the outcome of today’s RaiNet GC final."

Faris: "Don’t tell me. Overwhelming victory for Faris--" *She begins, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.*

Okabe: "No. You lose." *I cut her off, the harsh truth hanging heavy in the air.*

Faris: "Nyau..." *She frowns, her enthusiasm quickly diminishing.*

Okabe: *I reach out, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder.* "But that’s only because of the opposing team’s interference. So to protect you, I brought you these sunglasses and earplugs."
