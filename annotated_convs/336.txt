Okabe: *My hands instinctively grab onto Faris's slender shoulders. I can feel her trembling beneath my touch.* "Faris?"

Faris: *I let out a high-pitched cry, pushing Okabe's hands away with a force that takes him by surprise.* "Unyaaaaa! Kyouma, you meanie!"

Faris: *I feel a sudden surge of anger, my words coming out in a burst.* "This is a very important match for Faris, nya! How dare you say I’ll lose nya! You’re being mean! Are you a Viral Attackers spy, nya!?"
