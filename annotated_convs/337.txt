Faris: *I swish my imaginary tail, annoyance flickering in my eyes as I mimic the pout of a displeased cat.* "Why is everyone getting in Faris’s way, nya? I can’t hear myself think, nya!"

Okabe: *I reach out quickly, my fingers closing around her delicate wrist to halt her progress.* "Faris, I told you to wait!"

Faris: *I jerk my hand away from his grasp, my eyes narrowing in a perfect imitation of a threatened cat.* "Paws off!"

Okabe: *My eyes plead with her, my hands reaching out in a futile attempt to convey the urgency of my words.* "I’m begging you, please listen to what I’m saying!"

4℃: *I puff out my chest, my eyes shining with an almost fanatical devotion to RaiNet.* "Hey! Don’t you dare disregard the man closest to the truth of RaiNet."

Okabe: *I turn my gaze towards 4℃, irritation seeping into my voice.* "This is none of your business. Go away."

4℃: *I bristle at his dismissal, my fists clenching at my sides as I take a step closer to him.* "The hell you say! Don’t you know I’m the black nobleman of the RaiNet realm!?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow at his claim, a dry chuckle escaping my lips.* "Weren’t you the black peacock of the RaiNet realm? Get your story straight."

4℃: *I huff, crossing my arms over my chest in a show of defiance.* "I’m the black peacock nobleman. ’Cause black is the symbol of RaiNet."

Okabe: *I glance at the promotional posters adorning the walls, their blue and white motif standing in stark contrast to 4℃'s claim.* "Oh, I get it. You just like to say ’black.’"
