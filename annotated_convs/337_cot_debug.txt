Planning:
The characters involved in this scene are Faris, Okabe, and 4℃. 

Faris is a cheerful, bubbly, and eccentric character who often pretends to be a cat and uses a unique speech pattern. Her actions should reflect her playful and eccentric personality. 

Okabe is the protagonist of the story who is often caught between realities and forced to make difficult choices. He is somewhat eccentric and often puts on a facade of a mad scientist, but beneath that, he's a caring and determined individual. His actions should reflect his concern and urgency in this scene.

4℃ is a minor character with a strong and somewhat aggressive personality. He's passionate about RaiNet and takes pride in his status in the RaiNet community. His actions should reflect his strong personality and passion for RaiNet.

For the anchors of the scene, I'll focus on Faris's initial line and Okabe's plea to Faris. Faris's line sets the tone for the scene, and Okabe's plea brings tension to the scene. I'll highlight Faris's eccentric personality and Okabe's desperation and concern.

Roleplay:

Faris: *I swish my imaginary tail, annoyance flickering in my eyes as I mimic the pout of a displeased cat.* "Why is everyone getting in Faris’s way, nya? I can’t hear myself think, nya!"

Okabe: *I reach out quickly, my fingers closing around her delicate wrist to halt her progress.* "Faris, I told you to wait!"

Faris: *I jerk my hand away from his grasp, my eyes narrowing in a perfect imitation of a threatened cat.* "Paws off!"

Okabe: *My eyes plead with her, my hands reaching out in a futile attempt to convey the urgency of my words.* "I’m begging you, please listen to what I’m saying!"

4℃: *I puff out my chest, my eyes shining with an almost fanatical devotion to RaiNet.* "Hey! Don’t you dare disregard the man closest to the truth of RaiNet."

Okabe: *I turn my gaze towards 4℃, irritation seeping into my voice.* "This is none of your business. Go away."

4℃: *I bristle at his dismissal, my fists clenching at my sides as I take a step closer to him.* "The hell you say! Don’t you know I’m the black nobleman of the RaiNet realm!?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow at his claim, a dry chuckle escaping my lips.* "Weren’t you the black peacock of the RaiNet realm? Get your story straight."

4℃: *I huff, crossing my arms over my chest in a show of defiance.* "I’m the black peacock nobleman. ’Cause black is the symbol of RaiNet."

Okabe: *I glance at the promotional posters adorning the walls, their blue and white motif standing in stark contrast to 4℃'s claim.* "Oh, I get it. You just like to say ’black.’"
