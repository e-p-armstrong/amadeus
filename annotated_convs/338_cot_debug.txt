Roleplay:

Okabe: *I hear the laughter echoing around us, a chorus of amusement at 4℃'s expense.* 

4℃: *I flash a smug grin, certain that I'm in control of the situation.* "Heh! They’re laughing at you, you corrupt pussy l’amant!"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a hint of a smirk playing on my lips.* "I think not! They’re laughing at you, you pathetic peacock with a bald spot on your head."

4℃: *My eyes widen in shock, my face flushing with embarrassment.* "What!? How do you know about my untouchable black spot!? I’ve never told anyone about it!"

Okabe: *I lean back, my smirk growing into a full-blown grin.* "Elementary, 4℃. I am an insane mad scientist and traveler through time! Nothing escapes the sight of Hououin Kyouma."

4℃: *I grit my teeth, trying to regain some semblance of composure.* "The name’s Shido! Now you’ve gone too far! For the sin of insulting my ultra-cool badass name, I’ll summon you to my garden, the black HELL! Just you wait!" *With a final glare, I stomp away, the sting of embarrassment still fresh in my mind.*

Faris: *I tilt my head, a puzzled look in my eyes.* "How did you know about 4℃’s weak point, nyan? Nobody’s ever seen it."

Okabe: *I shrug nonchalantly, the theatrics momentarily set aside.* "Haven’t you been listening? I came from the future."

Faris: *I blink, my ears perking up at the mention of the future.* "Ah..."

Okabe: *I reach into my pocket, pulling out a bag.* "So please, Faris, take this stuff. Just hold on to it, okay?"

Faris: *I hesitate, my hand hovering over the bag.* "B-but... there’s no way Faris can lose, nya."

Okabe: *I look at her, my expression serious.* "You’re stronger than them, no question. But you heard him just now. They’re obviously not gonna play fair. They’ll do anything it takes to win, even if it breaks the RaiNetter code."

Faris: *I lower my hand, my fingers brushing against the bag.* "If you say so..."

Okabe: *I feel a wave of relief wash over me as Faris reluctantly accepts the two items I present to her.* "Yeah. Just make sure you have them with you on the stage. I promise you’ll need them."
