Itaru: *I pump my fists in the air, my voice boisterous and filled with excitement.* "You gotta cheer for Faris-tan too!"

Okabe: *I offer a noncommittal response, my gaze scanning the bustling crowd.* "Yeah..."

Itaru: *As if feeding off the crowd's energy, I start jumping and waving my hands in the air, oblivious to Okabe's anxiety.*

Spectator A: *My voice echoes throughout the hall, my devotion to Faris clear.* "Faris-tan!"

Spectator B: *I shout from the crowd, my admiration for Faris evident in my enthusiastic declaration.* "I love you, Faris!"

Spectator C: *With an excited gleam in my eyes, I join the chorus of cheers.* "Moe moe!!"

Okabe: *I watch as the flash of cameras illuminate the hall, everyone vying to get a picture of the adored catgirl.*

Faris: *My voice rings out, carried by the speakers to every corner of the hall.* "I’m gonna give it my best, everyone! So cheer for me, nyan♪" *I flash an impish smile, turning to the audience in a pose that radiates confidence and charm.*

Okabe: *The entire hall trembles with the roar of the crowd, a testament to Faris's overwhelming popularity. I can't help but marvel at the sight.*

Itaru: *My excitement reaches a fever pitch, my voice rising above the crowd's cheers.* "There it is! Yes! Faris! It’s me! Marry me!"

Okabe: *I watch as Daru loses himself in the excitement, a hint of concern creeping into my thoughts. Despite this, Faris's enthusiasm reassures me.* "How come there are two Viral Attackers, but Faris is all alone?"

Itaru: *I turn to Okabe, surprise etched on my face.* "What? You don’t even know about that?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, not quite familiar with the rules of RaiNet AccessBattlers. Daru's explanation earlier covered only the basics.*

Itaru: *I launch into an explanation, my voice filled with pride and admiration.* "In this tournament, duels take place between two-man teams. But since there’s nobody strong enough to be Faris-tan’s duel partner, she goes alone. Two heads are obviously better than one, but Faris can win despite her handicap! That’s why I love her!"

Okabe: *I furrow my brows, my curiosity piqued.* "These Viral Attackers... what sort of team are they?"

Itaru: *I shrug, my knowledge of the Viral Attackers limited.* "Hmm. I don’t know all the details, but apparently they’re a pretty aggressive team. But other than that, there’s a bunch of suspicious rumors about them. They’ve got a lot of followers, you see. And apparently, they don’t mind using those followers to interfere with their opponents during duels. About half the teams they faced in the championships were no-shows. And that’s not all. Apparently, they even go around beating up otaku in Akiba and Ikebukuro. Long story short, RaiNetters really hate them."

Okabe: *I frown, confusion seeping into my voice.* "Then why haven’t they been disqualified?"

Itaru: *I sigh, frustration tinging my voice.* "Cause there’s no evidence. RaiNetters are mostly kids and otaku. Just a little intimidation from some guys in black, and they clam up."
