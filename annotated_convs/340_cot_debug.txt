He's also very curious and analytical, often trying to understand the situation from different angles. His actions should reflect his analytical nature and his concern for his friends.

Roleplay:

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, adjusting my glasses with a confident smirk.* "You can discuss with your partner what moves to make. It’s harder for the opponent to predict what you’re going to do." *I explain, my hands mimicking the movement of cards on a game board.* 

Okabe: *I cross my arms, a thoughtful frown tugging at my lips as I try to understand the strategy behind the game.* "So basically, the partner just plays a support role."

Itaru: *I chuckle, shaking my head as I lean forward, my eyes sparkling with excitement.* "Well, there’s nothing to worry about. Faris-tan can beat the daylights outta these punks in the blink of an eye." *I say confidently, my faith in Faris unwavering.*

Announcer: *I grab the microphone, my voice booming through the speakers.* "Are both teams ready?" *I ask, my eyes scanning the players for any sign of hesitation.*

Okabe: *I watch as the referee gathers Faris and the two Virals for a coin toss to decide who takes the first turn, my heart pounding in anticipation.*

Announcer: *I take a deep breath, my voice echoing in the silent assembly hall.* "And now, for the RaiNet AccessBattlers Grand Championship Finals--" *I announce, my words hanging in the air as silence falls over the assembly hall, everyone holding their breath in anticipation.*

Okabe: *I can feel the tension in the room, the expectant silence making my heart pound in my chest. The referee’s shout signals the start of the game and the room erupts in cheers. I watch as the duel between Faris and the Viral Attackers unfolds before my eyes. Every time a Link Card or Virus Card is revealed, waves of excitement ripple through the audience. I’m starting to understand just how amazing Faris must be to become champion all by herself. The audience is on the edge of their seats. As best as I can tell, it looks like the Viral Attackers are, true to their name, on the attack.*

Okabe: *I turn to Itaru, my curiosity piqued.* "What sort of strategy does Faris use?"

Itaru: *I shrug, a small smile playing on my lips as I recall Faris's past matches.* "I guess you could say she’s a slow starter. She spends the first half focusing on reading her opponent’s cards. She plays it safe. And instead, she waits until the endgame for a sudden reversal. That’s probably how she’ll play it this time, too." *I explain, my voice filled with admiration and anticipation for the thrilling match ahead.*
