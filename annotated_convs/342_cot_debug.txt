Planning:
In this scene, we have two characters: Itaru and Okabe. Itaru is a laid-back, timid, and tech-savvy character. He is not one for confrontations or dramatic actions. On the other hand, Okabe is the protagonist of Steins;Gate, known for his eccentric personality and dramatic flair. He is also resourceful and determined. Given this, Itaru’s actions will be written in a more reserved, cautious manner, whereas Okabe’s actions will be bold and determined. 

In this particular scene, Okabe is about to leave to find whoever is causing trouble, and Itaru is questioning him. Okabe's line "I’m going to find whoever’s doing this and stop them!" will serve as the anchor for this part, highlighting his determination and resolve. I'll write this line in a passionate, decisive manner. 

Itaru's lines will be tinged with anxiety and concern, reflecting his worry for Okabe's safety. I will add actions that involve fidgeting and expressions of worry.

Roleplay:
Itaru: *My fingers tighten around the edge of my shirt, my voice shaky as I call out to him.* "Hey, where are you going!?"

Okabe: *I turn to Itaru, my back straight, determination flashing in my eyes. I clench my fist, steeling myself for the challenge ahead.* "I’m going to find whoever’s doing this and stop them!" *With that, I stride towards the door, each step echoing my resolve.*

Itaru: *I watch as Okabe walks away, my heart pounding in my chest. I can't help but let out a sigh, my voice trembling with worry.* "But how are you gonna find them in this crowd!?"
