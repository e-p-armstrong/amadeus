Okabe: *I stare at Faris, my heart pounding in my chest like a drum. She's been silent since the match started, her face a mask of concentration. I've done my part, removed the interference, now it's her turn. I wait, anticipating her reversal, praying for a miracle.* "What!?" *I blurt out as she turns her face away, her eyes avoiding mine, as if she's trying to escape from something. Panic surges through me. Is it another laser!?*

4℃: *I smirk, my voice oozing with mockery.* "Hey, Champion. They say your eyes can see into a man’s soul. They say you have the power to read minds, which makes you a cheater even my pure black evil heart can’t abide."

Okabe: *My thoughts race, my mind a whirlpool of confusion. Can she really do that? Can Faris actually read minds? The audience starts to murmur, their whispers echoing my doubts. I try to suppress my imagination, to keep it grounded, but the thought is too enticing. It would explain so much. Her aversion to the laser attacks, her confusing moves, everything.*

4℃: *I point an accusing finger at Faris, my voice growing louder, more triumphant.* "Basically, ya ain’t human. You’re an ugly angel. ’Cause you peek into the heart of any poor sap who talks to you. Everyone, beware! Keep your distance! Or this pussy will steal your every secret by reading your thoughts! And then she’ll blackmail you. Hand over your money? Throw your RaiNet match? What will you demand next!?"

Okabe: *I feel a surge of protectiveness, a need to defend Faris.* "Faris!" *I call out, my voice echoing in the silent room.*

Faris: *I finally speak, my voice barely a whisper, my eyes still avoiding Okabe's gaze.* "...ctory"

4℃: *I lean forward, my eyebrows furrowing in confusion.* "Ah? What was that?"

Faris: *I lift my head, my eyes meeting Okabe's. With a soft smile, I finally respond, my voice full of determination.* "...I use Change Directory. Nya."
