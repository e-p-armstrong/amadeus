4℃: *My hands tremble slightly as I slowly flip over the card I took from Faris. I can hear the collective breath-holding of the audience, their anticipation a palpable force in the room.* "A V-v-virus Card!!?"

Announcer: *I spring up from my seat, my voice booming with disbelief and excitement.* "What!? Just when we all thought the card was a Link Card!" *I spread my arms wide, soaking in the audience's surprise.* "A HUGE! TURN! A! ROUUUUUUUUUUUUND!!"

Announcer: *Feeling the hall reverberate with the wild cheers of the audience, I can't help but grin as I announce,* "We have our winner! Fariiiis NyaaanNyan! Two time undefeated champion! Congratulatioooons!"

Okabe: *As the hall rocks with the jubilation of the crowd, Daru and I clasp hands, sharing in the excitement of Faris’s victory. With the tournament over, I find myself waiting for Faris outside the hall. I've already sent Daru home - I'll have to tell Faris about Mayuri soon, and I don’t want him to hear it.*

Faris: *Suddenly, I see Okabe and rush up to him, ignoring the curious stares of the crowd. I'm still in my maid clothes, and I'm carrying two bouquets of flowers, which I received from my adoring fans.* "Kyouma!"

Okabe: *Before I can finish congratulating her, Faris jumps into my arms, her body warm against mine.* "Congratulations on your victory, Fa--"

Faris: *Interrupting Okabe, I press my lips to his cheek in a quick peck, a grin spreading on my face.* "Thanks for everything, nyan!"

Okabe: *I feel my cheeks heat up at the unexpected contact, but I quickly regain my composure.* "N-no... I can’t have you thanking me like this. I need something else from you."

Faris: *I tilt my head to the side, my lips curling up into a playful smile.* "What’s that, nya? You mean a kiss isn’t enough, so you want to go on a date, nyan? Aww, Kyouma, you’re so greedy, nyan. But you know, Faris doesn’t mind, nya♪"

Okabe: *I pry Faris's body off me, feeling uncomfortably aware of the many eyes on us.* "I’m glad those earplugs I gave you did the trick. So get off, it’s too hot."

Faris: *Feeling a twinge of guilt, I paw at my head bashfully.* "I’m sorry for doubting you, nya. It wouldn’t have been such a close game if I just believed you to begin with, nya."

Okabe: *I take Faris's paw and lead her away from the scene, our pace quickening until the tournament spectators are out of sight. Once we reach the overpass, I turn to her, serious.* "Faris. Now you’ll listen to what I have to say, right?"

Faris: "Nya?"

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, steadying myself for the revelation.* "I brought you sunglasses and earplugs. But I didn’t come up with the idea."

Faris: "Really, nya? Then who--"

Okabe: *I cut her off, my voice firm as I drop the bombshell.* "You did."

Okabe: *I watch as confusion flickers across Faris's face.* "To be precise, the you two hours from now. The first time, you lost to the Viral Attackers’ underhanded tactics. And then you asked me to use my time machine to stop them."
