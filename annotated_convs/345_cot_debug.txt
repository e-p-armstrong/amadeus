Planning:

Okabe is the main character, a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He is often intense, passionate, and dramatic, with a tendency to lapse into internal monologues. His internal thoughts will be filled with analytical observations and dramatic flair, reflecting his eccentric personality. I will emphasize his thought processes, frustrations, and his internal struggle.

Faris is a cheerful, playful, and somewhat flirty character. She usually speaks in a unique, cat-themed mannerism ("nya"). She can be serious when the situation calls for it, but usually maintains her playful demeanor. Her actions will involve playful gestures, flirtatious advances, and whimsical movements. I'll use her actions to showcase her quirky personality and her teasing interactions with Okabe.

The anchors of this scene will be Faris' playful confession about her 'mind-reading' ability and Okabe's internal struggle about the D-Mail. I'll add emotional depth and tension to these moments, emphasizing the playful mystery surrounding Faris and the desperation in Okabe's situation.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I plant my feet firmly on the ground, my hands clenched into fists at my side.* "This was a contract, so to speak. You almost remembered the D-Mail you sent to change the past, even though you should’ve forgotten. You said that you’d remember if you won the RaiNet tournament."

Faris: *I tilt my head, my feline eyes blinking in confusion.* "???"

Okabe: *I step closer, my gaze intense.* "Well? Do you remember? It’s very important, so I need you to try."

Faris: *I bite my lip, my eyes narrowing in thought.* "Hm..."

Okabe: *I watch as Faris stares into my eyes, her gaze probing. She places a finger against her lips, lost in thought. A moment later, a playful smile graces her lips.*

Faris: "Faris was probably pulling your tail, nya."

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback.* "What?"

Faris: *I twirl a strand of my hair around my finger, my voice taking on a teasing tone.* "That Faris was depressed she lost to the Virals, nya? So when she heard about the time machine, she wanted to use it to win, nya. Because if she didn’t, she’d be too ashamed to see Papa, nya... I’m sure she just played along with Kyouma, and said she remembered... that’s what I think, nya... That’s probably what Faris would do, nya."

Okabe: *My heart sinks. I feel a knot in my stomach.* "No way..."

Okabe: *I curse inwardly. I was a fool to trust this catgirl! I should’ve expected this from how she normally acts. I heave a deep sigh and lean on the overpass’s guardrail. The realization hits me hard – all that work was for nothing. I'm still stuck in this warped timeline, with no clue about the contents of Faris’s D-Mail. Faris has forgotten it ever happened, and there's no trace of it in her send history. I clench my fists, feeling lost.*

Faris: *I reach out, gently touching Okabe's arm.* "Kyouma."

Okabe: *I stiffen at her touch. Suddenly, Faris's voice whispers into my ear.*

Faris: "Look into Faris’s eyes, nya."

Okabe: *I turn to her, my brows furrowed in confusion.* "What?"

Faris: *I lean closer, a mischievous glint in my eyes.* "Just look, nya."

Okabe: *I feel Faris's breath tickling my ear, her face just inches from mine. Her proximity makes my heart race. Is she planning to kiss me this time? Her usually playful expression is replaced by a serious one. I swallow hard, and do as I'm told. I turn to Faris and meet her gaze. Our eyes lock. An outsider would mistake us for a couple lost in our own world. This is the closest I’ve ever been to Faris. Her beauty captivates me. Her eyelashes are really long.*

Faris: *I chuckle softly, breaking the intense silence.* "Nervous, nya?"

Okabe: *I stammer, my cheeks heating up.* "O-of course not. I’m busy solving Fermat’s Last Theorem in my head."

Faris: *I giggle, my eyes twinkling with amusement.* "In other words, you’re nervous, nya. The truth is, Faris has only one power, nya."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, intrigued despite myself.* "Your power? Do you mean..."

Faris: *I lean in closer, my voice dropping to a whisper.* "It’s a secret, but I’ll make an exception for Kyouma. Truth is, Faris can read people’s minds, nyan. I call my power Cheshire Break. Whatcha think, nya? Awesome, nyan?"

Okabe: *I reel back in surprise, my eyes widening.* "...I’m an exception? But the Virals knew about it too, didn’t they?"

Faris: *I blink in surprise, my cat-like grin returning.* "I had no idea the cat was out of the bag, nya."
