Plan:
The characters involved in the scene are Okabe, Faris, 4℃, and the crowd around them. Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist and quite dramatic, yet underneath his eccentricities, he has a keen analytical mind. Faris is a playful and energetic character with a penchant for adding "nya" to her sentences and a love for all things cat-related. 4℃ is a rival character, aggressive and confrontational. 

Okabe's actions and thoughts will carry a sense of urgency and concern, while Faris will maintain her playful and carefree nature even in tense situations. 4℃'s actions will reflect his aggressive nature, his dialogue filled with anger and confrontation.

The anchor lines would be Faris' confession about her power and 4℃'s accusation of cheating. These lines will drive the tension and emotion of the scene, and I'll enhance them with descriptive details and reactions.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *My eyebrows furrow in confusion, my mind trying to piece together the puzzle.* "...Wait, so you’ve been using that power at RaiNet tournaments?"

Faris: *A twinkle in my eyes, I nod enthusiastically.* "Of course, nya♪ Faris is an entertainer, nyan. It’s my style to get into a tight spot on purpose so I can make a huge turnaround, nyan. Besides, if I wear sunglasses, I can’t read my opponent’s thoughts, nyan." *I add, tapping my temple as if emphasizing the point.*

Okabe: *An unspoken question lingers in my eyes, a puzzle piece falling into place. So, that's why she didn’t put them on...* 

Faris: *I give him a knowing smile, my fingers gently playing with a lock of my hair.* "It’s because of this power that I knew you weren’t lying."

Okabe: "But you wouldn’t go along with me at all in the beginning, though." *My voice carries a hint of frustration, my hand instinctively reaching for my lab coat.*

Faris: *I giggle, my hand covering my mouth, my eyes sparkling with mischief.* "You just rubbed my fur the wrong way, nya."

Okabe: *A suspicion creeps into my mind, like a cat on the prowl. It feels like she’s tricking me again...*

Faris: "And I can tell you’re not lying now either, nya. Faris used that ’D-Mail’ thing to change the past, nya? I believe you, nya. I wish I could remember... but I’m sorry, nya. I can’t remember, nyan..." *My voice trails off, a hint of sadness flickering in my eyes.*

Okabe: "I see..." *My heart sinks, the weight of our situation pressing down on me. We’ve reached an impasse. I have no choice but to look for some other way.*

Okabe: "...?" *Suddenly, I feel the atmosphere change, as if a cold wind blew through us. I look around and realize that we’re surrounded by people. Are they jealous Faris fans who think I’m her boyfriend!? I shudder at the thought, but I don’t think that’s the case. Then who are they? Moeka’s Rounders!?* 

4℃: "Yo." *I step forward, my black outfit stark against the crowd.*

Okabe: *My eyes narrow as I recognize the man clad in black. Oh, it’s the bald spot guy again. What does he want now? I glance at the men surrounding us, all dressed like 4℃. So are all of these guys Viral Attacker underlings? I notice 4℃’s gaudy white teeth shine.*

4℃: "I’ve got a word with you, champion. Gaia whispered for me to register an objection." *My voice booms, echoing in the silence.*

Faris: "An objection?" *I tilt my head, my eyes wide with surprise.*

4℃: "You damn pussy. The power to read the minds of your opponents? That’s bullshit! I know you were cheating!" *My voice rises with every word, my anger reaching a boiling point.*

Okabe: "She wasn’t cheating! You’re the ones who were cheating!" *I retort, my voice strong and determined.*

Faris: "Faris doesn’t use underhanded tricks like you guys, nya." *I reply, my voice firm and confident.*

4℃: "The hell you say? I, the black nobleman, swear to the god of the elegant evil realm, that I never cheat! Though sometimes I do other things. Okay, you corrupt white Siamese cat? I ain’t gonna accept that defeat. That last Change Directory was a fraud." *I spit out the words, my fists clenched in defiance.*

Okabe: "You don’t have any proof." *I stand my ground, refusing to back down from his baseless accusations.*
