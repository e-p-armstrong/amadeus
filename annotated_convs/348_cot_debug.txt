Planning/Thoughts/Brainstorming:

Okabe is the protagonist and the character through which we experience the story. He's a bit eccentric, often indulging in his 'mad scientist' persona, but he's also deeply caring and protective of his friends. His dialogue should reflect his intelligence and determination, and his actions should show his resourcefulness and care for Faris. 

Faris is a cheerful and playful character, often incorporating "nya" into her sentences and playing up a cat-like persona. However, she's also shown to be quite savvy, especially when it comes to the management of the maid cafe. Her dialogue and actions should reflect this duality.

The anchor lines for this roleplay will be:
1. Okabe: "Haah, haah... If this were MayQueen, we’d have air conditioning, and I could get something to drink..."
2. Faris: "Papa’s such a blockhead, nya... If he left the store to me, it would’ve been the best maid cafe in all of Japan, with mmhmm costumes and hnngtastic maids, nya. It would’ve even pulled customers to Akiba from all the way over in Ueno and Ikebukuro. It’s such a waste, nya."

Okabe's anchor line will be expanded to show his longing for the comforts of the MayQueen cafe and his concern for Faris's wellbeing. Faris's anchor line will be expanded to show her dreams and ambitions for the maid cafe, and her frustration with her father's lack of faith in her.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I swiftly pull out my phone, my fingers flying over the keys as I compose a quick email to Daru.* "We need help. Faris and I are hiding above 'Ramen Tasaburou.' There's nothing useful here, no weapons, no decent hiding spots. The Viral Attackers won't back off, and I can't fight at full strength with Faris nearby. We need a taxi, ASAP." *With a final tap, I send the email off into the ether, hoping Daru gets it in time.*

Okabe: *I let out a sigh of relief, my body sagging against a sack of wheat flour.* "--whew"

Okabe: *I can feel beads of sweat trickling down my face, the heat in here is stifling.* "Haah, haah... If this were MayQueen, we’d have air conditioning, and I could get something to drink... A cold glass of melon soda would be perfect right about now..."

Faris: *Her ears perk up, a look of confusion crossing her face.* "Nya?"

Okabe: *I quickly shake my head, forcing a smile onto my face.* "Oh, nothing..."

Okabe: *I feel a pang of regret as Faris gazes at me, her eyes filled with confusion. I shouldn't have mentioned MayQueen.*

Faris: *She tilts her head, her cat-like eyes narrowing in suspicion.* "How do you know the name of the maid cafe that was supposed to open here, nya?"

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by her question.* "Eh...?"

Faris: *A look of realization crosses her face, and she nods knowingly.* "Oh, I know. We opened up the homepage for a little bit to post maid recruiting information, nyan. Did you see it?"

Okabe: *I nod, trying to keep my surprise hidden.* "...It was supposed to open?"

Faris: *She sighs, her tail swishing in frustration.* "Faris organized the cafe’s plans and passed it through the conference. It was almost a done deal, nyan. But at the last moment, Papa put his paw down, and the plan died, nya. Papa’s such a blockhead, nya... If he left the store to me, it would’ve been the best maid cafe in all of Japan, with mmhmm costumes and hnngtastic maids, nya. It would’ve even pulled customers to Akiba from all the way over in Ueno and Ikebukuro. It’s such a waste, nya."

Okabe: *I take a moment to process her words, my heart aching for the Akihabara I once knew.* "Faris... no, Akiha Rumiho."

Faris: *She looks at me, her eyes wide in surprise.* "Hanyan?"

Okabe: *I meet her gaze, my voice steady and sure.* "You’re the Akiha daughter and heir, so you go to the Akihabara city development conferences too, right?"

Faris: *She blinks, confusion returning to her face.* "Nnya? I don’t attend, nya."

Okabe: *My heart sinks, the realization hitting me like a punch to the gut.* "You don’t? But didn’t you say that..."

Okabe: *I feel a chill run down my spine as I realize that her words may have been from before the worldline changed.*

Faris: *She shakes her head, her ears twitching in annoyance.* "Papa’s the one who goes to the conferences, nya. Why would Faris have to go nya?"

Okabe: *I press on, my mind racing as I try to piece together the puzzle.* "Then, why did you go to the conferences?"

Faris: *She crosses her arms, her voice firm.* "Like I said, I don’t, nya."
