Plan:
- Faris is a playful and energetic character with a love for the otaku culture. She often ends her sentences with "nya" and likes to refer to herself in the third person. Her *actions* will be lively and exaggerated, reflecting her outgoing personality.
- Okabe, on the other hand, is more serious and analytical. He's often lost in his thoughts, trying to make sense of the world around him. His *actions* will be more restrained, and his *thoughts* will be complex and contemplative.
- The anchor lines in this scene will be Faris's revelation about her memories. I will emphasize this with dramatic *actions* and intense emotions.
- I will take the thematic direction of mystery and revelation, focusing on Faris's rediscovery of her forgotten past.

Roleplay:
Faris: *I beam brightly, my pigtails bouncing as I speak.* "Yeah! By the way, we still haven’t found an IBN 5100, nyan."

Okabe: *I furrow my brows, my fingers drumming on the tabletop.* "Has your dad ever sold any or given one away?" *I ponder, recalling a different timeline. In that worldline, Faris’s dad had donated the IBN 5100 to Yanabayashi Shrine. Or was it Faris who did that?*

Faris: *I shake my head emphatically, my eyes sparkling with certainty.* "Never, nya. Papa loves all of the PCs he’s collected, nya. He’d never get rid of one, nya."

Okabe: *My gaze narrows, my mind racing to make sense of this discrepancy.* "Why then did he donate the IBN 5100? And do you have any retro PCs, Faris?"

Faris: *I shrug nonchalantly, twirling a lock of my hair.* "I don’t get Papa’s hobby at all, nya. Faris likes cosplay and anime and cute things, nyan."

Okabe: *I nod slowly, piecing together the puzzle.* "So the moe shops disappeared because you didn’t participate in the city development conferences. That must be what the D-Mail was about. But let’s say you participated in city development ever since you were a child."

Faris: *I giggle, my eyes lighting up with excitement.* "I’d put moe shops all over Akiba, nya. Just visit ComiMa and you’ll see the wonder of otaku power, nya. I’m sure more people would visit Akiba then, nyan."

Okabe: *I lean in, my tone growing serious.* "That aside, if you no longer wanted to participate after participating for all that time... How would you stop yourself in the past?"

Faris: *I tilt my head, my expression turning thoughtful.* "Is this some sorta psychological test, nya?"

Okabe: *I wave my hand dismissively, trying to maintain a casual tone.* "It’s just a hypothetical question." *I watch as Faris ponders this for a while.*

Faris: *I suddenly snap my fingers, a sly grin on my face.* "Hm... a dramatic way would be purrfect."

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback.* "What?"

Faris: *I giggle, clapping my hands together.* "Like you see on TV, nya. Faris is weak to drama, nya. I probably got that from Papa, nyan."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, my mind trying to keep up with her antics.* "Really?"

Faris: *I nod, my eyes gleaming with mischief.* "For example, if Faris got kidnapped or--" *Suddenly, I fall silent. The room is dark, and my expression is unreadable.*

Okabe: *I lean forward, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Faris? Kid...napped?"

Faris: *I clutch my head, a grimace of pain crossing my face.* "Ugh... My head hurts, nya... H-hey, Kyouma... Faris has been feeling funny since coming to this storehouse, nya... Even though I only came here once, back when I was a little kitten... It feels really... nyastalgic... Like I’ve been here... many times, nya..."

Okabe: *I blink, my mind reeling. Is she messing with me again? No, this feels too real.* "What does this mean?"

Faris: *Suddenly, my face lights up. I grab Okabe's arm, my eyes wide with realization.* "Ah... I... remember..."

Okabe: *I stiffen, my breath hitching in my throat.* "Remember what?"

Faris: *I squeeze Okabe's arm, my voice full of excitement.* "I remember, nya!" *The force of my declaration stifles his response.*

Faris: "MayQueen+Nyan²! Kyouma and Daru-nyan were regular customers, nya. And Mayushii worked here too, nya."

Okabe: *My eyes widen, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Really? You really remember that?"

Faris: *I nod, my eyes shining with determination.* "And how Kyouma and Daru talked about the time machine at the store, and how I asked to use it in return for helping find an IBN 5100. And how later, I convinced Kyouma and Daru-nyan it was weird to compare time to a river. And how I took the blood oath to become a lab mem."
