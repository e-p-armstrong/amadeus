Okabe: *I lean in closer, my voice lowering to a whisper as the gravity of the situation sinks in.* "And the D-Mail? Do you remember what you sent?"

Faris: *I let out a sigh, my playful smile fading as I meet Okabe's gaze.* "I remember, but... you said you have to cancel it, nya?"

Okabe: *I nod grimly, my hands balling into fists as I steel myself for what I have to say.* "Yes. I need to undo the changes made to the past by your D-Mail."

Faris: *I recoil, shaking my head vigorously as I press myself against Okabe, my cat-like eyes wide with fear.* "You can’t, nya!"

Okabe: *I feel my heart rate quicken as Faris presses closer, her hot breath fanning against my cheek. I swallow hard, reminding myself to stay focused.* "Please listen, Faris! Mayuri’s life depends on it!"

Faris: *I blink, taken aback by Okabe's urgency. I pull away slightly, my eyes searching his face for answers.* "Eh... Mayushii’s...?"

Viral Attacker A: *I push the door open, my eyes scanning the dim room as I call out.* "Is Faris really hiding in here?"

Viral Attacker B: *I follow closely behind, my voice echoing in the room.* "Someone saw two people who looked like them go inside."

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest as I quickly cover Faris's mouth with my hand, fear coursing through me at the prospect of being discovered.* "...!"
