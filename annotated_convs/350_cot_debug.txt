Planning/Brainstorming:

Characters involved:
1. Okabe: Okabe is a character who often hides his true feelings behind a mask of eccentricity. He is deeply committed to his friends and will do anything to protect them. He tends to be dramatic and flamboyant, but in this scene he is desperate and worried, leading to more restrained and anxious behavior.
2. Faris: Faris is a cheerful and playful character, with a catgirl persona. She often speaks in a cutesy way, but underneath that, she is deeply caring and sensitive. In this scene, she reveals a deep personal pain, and her usual playful demeanor is replaced with seriousness and sadness.
3. Viral Attackers: These are unknown characters who pose a threat to Okabe and Faris. Their presence adds tension to the scene.

Anchoring Lines:
1. Faris: "The wish Faris made with her D-Mail..." - This line reveals the emotional weight of Faris's D-Mail and sets up the reveal of her father's death. This line can be transformed to emphasize Faris's emotional turmoil.
2. Okabe: "!?" - This line signifies Okabe's shock at Faris's reveal and his realization of the gravity of his request. It can be transformed to emphasize Okabe's internal conflict and the moral dilemma he faces.

Thematic Direction:
The main themes of this scene are desperation, moral conflict, and the weight of personal loss. The writing should emphasize these themes, focusing on the characters' inner turmoil and the tension of the situation.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I lean in closer, my voice lowering to a whisper as the gravity of the situation sinks in.* "And the D-Mail? Do you remember what you sent?"

Faris: *I let out a sigh, my playful smile fading as I meet Okabe's gaze.* "I remember, but... you said you have to cancel it, nya?"

Okabe: *I nod grimly, my hands balling into fists as I steel myself for what I have to say.* "Yes. I need to undo the changes made to the past by your D-Mail."

Faris: *I recoil, shaking my head vigorously as I press myself against Okabe, my cat-like eyes wide with fear.* "You can’t, nya!"

Okabe: *I feel my heart rate quicken as Faris presses closer, her hot breath fanning against my cheek. I swallow hard, reminding myself to stay focused.* "Please listen, Faris! Mayuri’s life depends on it!"

Faris: *I blink, taken aback by Okabe's urgency. I pull away slightly, my eyes searching his face for answers.* "Eh... Mayushii’s...?"

Okabe: *I grip Faris's shoulders, my voice steady despite the desperation clawing at my throat.* "If we don’t return the worldline to normal... if I don’t get that IBN 5100, then Mayuri will die. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it’s the truth. So please. I need to send another D-Mail and cancel the one you--"

Faris: *My voice trembles as I cut him off, my eyes welling up with tears that reflect the dim light around us.* "The wish Faris made with her D-Mail..."

Okabe: *I freeze, my words dying in my throat as I take in Faris's teary-eyed expression.* "--!?"

Faris: *I wipe at my eyes, trying to regain my composure as I continue.* "The wish Faris made... ...was to save Papa, who died ten years ago, nya."

Okabe: *I reel back, my mind spinning as I process Faris's words. My breath hitches, the weight of my request crushing me.* "--!?"

Viral Attacker A: *I push the door open, my eyes scanning the dim room as I call out.* "Is Faris really hiding in here?"

Viral Attacker B: *I follow closely behind, my voice echoing in the room.* "Someone saw two people who looked like them go inside."

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest as I quickly cover Faris's mouth with my hand, fear coursing through me at the prospect of being discovered.* "...!"
