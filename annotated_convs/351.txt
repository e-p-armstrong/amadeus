Kurisu: *I grip the phone tightly, my voice straining with urgency.* "Okabe! Can you hear me!? We called a taxi, but it’ll take some time to get there."

Okabe: *I feel a cold sweat trickling down my spine as I respond, my eyes darting towards the menacing figures approaching us.* "You exposed us to the pursuers. They’re right in front of us!"

Viral Attacker A: *I pound my fist into my palm, a sinister smirk spreading across my face.* "Hey, come out!"

Viral Attacker B: *I sneer, my eyes scanning the dimly lit room.* "There’s no point in hiding!"

Kurisu: *I let out a deep breath, my fingers tapping against the phone as I devise a plan.* "I see. Then I’ll lecture you on how to escape. You’re in the same the place you were before, right?"

Okabe: *I press my back against the wall, my heart pounding as I listen to Kurisu's voice. The men are getting closer, but they can't see us in the dark.* 

Kurisu: *I speak quickly, my words clear and precise.* "Scatter the flour and make a break for it. OK?"

Okabe: *I blink in confusion, my gaze shifting to a sack of wheat flour nearby. Scatter the flour?*

Kurisu: *I nod to myself, anticipating his confusion.* "Then switch on the light."

Okabe: *Understanding dawns on me. I grip the phone tighter, my resolve solidifying.* "Roger. Over and out."

Okabe: *I catch a glimpse of something shiny. One of the men is wielding a butterfly knife, the blade glinting ominously.*

Faris: *I gasp, my eyes wide with fear.*

Okabe: *I move quickly, tearing open the sack of wheat flour and scattering it into the air. The room is filled with a cloud of white dust, blocking our view.*

Viral Attacker A: *I choke, my eyes stinging as I try to see through the thick dust.* "What the hell!?"

Viral Attacker B: *I cough violently, squinting through the blinding whiteness.* "I can’t see! Cough cough!"

Okabe: *I seize the moment of confusion, hoisting Faris over my shoulder and sprinting towards the exit. I push her out first, then flip the light switch just before slamming the door shut.*

Faris: *I cough, shaking off the flour from my clothes and hair.* "Khohkhoh, khohkhohkhoh!"

Okabe: *I press the end call button, shoving the phone back into my pocket. But it's too late. They heard it.*

Viral Attacker A: *I grin, my brass knuckles glinting in the light.* "Hey, we found you!"

Viral Attacker B: *I chuckle, my teeth bared in a menacing grin.* "Hehhehhe! You can’t escape!"

Okabe: *My heart sinks as I see the men cornering us. Is this the end?*

Faris: *I feign horror, pointing towards the window.* "Oh no! 4℃ got run over by a car, nya!"

Viral Attacker A: *I whirl around, my eyes wide with shock.* "Wh-what!? 4℃-san!?"

Okabe: *I seize the moment, following Faris as she slips past the distracted men. We race down the stairs, our footsteps echoing loudly.*

Okabe: *I pant, my chest heaving with exertion.* "Nice feint, Faris!"

Viral Attacker C: *I block their path, my face set in a grimace.* "You’re not getting away!"

Viral Attacker D: *I snarl, closing in on them.* "Get them!"

Okabe: *My heart sinks as we're ambushed. We were so close to the lab...*

Faris: *I stop in my tracks, my eyes wide with fear.* "Oh no..."
