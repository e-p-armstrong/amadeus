Planning:

Okabe: Okabe is the central character in this scene, and he's in a great deal of physical and emotional pain. He's being attacked and mocked by a group of 'Virals', but he still manages to keep his sarcastic and defiant demeanor. His actions should reflect his pain and his struggle to maintain his dignity under duress.

4℃: 4℃ is the primary antagonist in this scene. He's physically assaulting Okabe, demonstrating a sadistic enjoyment in causing pain and humiliation. His actions should reflect his aggression and his cruel pleasure in the situation.

Faris: Faris is desperately trying to stop the violence, but her pleas fall on deaf ears. She's scared for Okabe, but also brave in her attempts to intervene. Her actions should demonstrate her fear and her courage.

Faris's Dad: He's the savior in this scene, arriving just in time to rescue Okabe and Faris. His actions should reflect his urgency and determination.

Anchors:
1. Okabe's line, "No... my right hand... my right haaaaand! Please, stop! I don’t want to kill any moooore!" This line is a plea, a desperate call for mercy. It's a moment of vulnerability and horror that should be emphasized.
2. Faris's line, "Stop it, nya! Don’t hurt Kyouma any more!" This line reflects Faris's desperation and fear for Okabe's safety. It's a plea for mercy that goes unheard, adding to the overall tension of the scene.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I clutch at my right hand, pain radiating up my arm.* "No... my right hand... my right haaaaand! Please, stop! I don’t want to kill any moooore!"

4℃: *He looks at me, a cruel grin spreading across his face.* "Hey, what the hell is he doing?"

Okabe: *Suddenly, a sharp pain sears through the top of my head. I wince as a can, thrown by one of the Virals, hits me.* 

Viral Attacker C: *He points at me, his voice filled with contempt.* "Don’t let him trick you! He’s just a textbook chuunibyou case!"

Okabe: *I scoff, struggling to maintain my composure.* "Yeah, like you guys can talk."

Viral Attacker D: *His face hardens, his voice cold and dismissive.* "Whatever! Just kick his ass!"

Okabe: *I draw in a deep breath, steeling myself for what's to come.* "Very well... then prepare yourselves! Releasing restriction si--"

Okabe: *Before I can finish, 4℃ lands a swift kick in my solar plexus, cutting me off.* "Gweh..."

Faris: *Her voice rings out, filled with concern.* "Kyouma!"

Okabe: *4℃ grabs the top of my head, knees me repeatedly, and then finally lets go of my hair. I hit the ground, coughing violently. I raise my arms to protect my face as 4℃ starts laying into me with heavy kicks.*

4℃: *He laughs, a cold, cruel sound.* "Heh! I told you, man! The coldest ice burns!"

Okabe: *Despite the pain, I manage to grit out a response.* "That’s frostbite, you idiot--"

4℃: *His face contorts with rage.* "Why you!"

Okabe: *He starts stomping on me with his booted heels, each blow sending waves of pain through my body.*

Faris: *Her voice is desperate, filled with fear.* "Kyouma!"

Okabe: *All I can feel is pain, overwhelming and all-consuming. I abandon all thought and wait for the storm to pass.*

Faris: *She cries out again, her voice echoing in my ears.* "Stop it, nya! Don’t hurt Kyouma any more!"

4℃: *He spits out his words, his voice filled with contempt.* "Don’t tell me what to do! I only listen to the whispers of Gaia!"

Okabe: *Suddenly, 4℃ grabs my thumb in both hands and starts to twist. The pain is unbearable.*

Faris: *Her voice rises in panic.* "Stop it! Someone, help!"

Okabe: *Suddenly, the sound of a car’s exhaust cuts through the noise. A limousine barrels into the alleyway at terrific speed. Everyone screams and scatters to avoid it. The smell of burnt rubber fills the air, and tire tracks mark the asphalt. The limousine stops right in front my fallen body, and the back door swings open.*

Faris’s Dad: *His voice is urgent, commanding.* "Get inside!"

Faris: *She stammers, her voice filled with relief.* "P-Papa!"

Okabe: *But I can’t even stand up. There’s no strength left in my body, and my vision is blurry. Suddenly, I feel slender arms wrap around my body, pulling me towards the car. The soft scent of citrus tickles my nose.*

Faris: *Her voice is gentle, soothing.* "Hang in there, nya!"
