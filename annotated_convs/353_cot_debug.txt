Planning stage:

Okabe: Our protagonist is a self-proclaimed mad scientist who often puts up a facade of insanity to hide his concern for his friends. He's currently in a situation of guilt and regret for not being able to protect Faris. His *actions and thoughts* will be filled with self-deprecation and inner turmoil. 

Faris: She's a cheerful and playful character, often speaking in a cutesy manner. However, underneath the cheerful exterior, she carries a heavy burden. Her *actions and thoughts* will be a mix of her playful nature and her serious undertones. 

Faris’s Dad: He's a loving father who deeply cares for his daughter, Faris. His *actions and thoughts* will show his affection towards Faris and his gratitude towards Okabe for saving Faris's life. 

Anchor Lines: 
1. Okabe: "I wasn’t able to do anything against those guys. I was pathetic..."
2. Faris: "The wish Faris made... ...was to save Papa, who died ten years ago, nya."

Thematic Direction: The anchor lines will center around the themes of regret, self-blame, and sacrifice. 

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I swallow hard, a bitter taste in my mouth as I reflect on my weakness.* "I wasn’t able to do anything against those guys. I was pathetic..."

Faris’s Dad: *He shakes my hand, his grip strong and reassuring.* "Absolutely not. You saved my daughter’s life."

Faris: *She rushes towards her father, a playful scowl on her face.* "Oh, Papa... I thought I told you not to push yourself since you’ve got important work to do. You should listen to me, nya."

Okabe: *A pang of guilt hits me as I remember our conversation at the ramen shop.* "The wish Faris made... ...was to save Papa, who died ten years ago, nya."

Faris’s Dad: *He looks at his daughter, a soft smile spreading across his face.* "I always keep my promises to you, Rumiho. I made that decision long ago."

Faris: *Her eyes well up with unshed tears, her voice barely above a whisper.* "Papa... thank you, nya."

Faris’s Dad: *As the limousine pulls up to the apartment, he turns to me.* "So you’re looking for an IBN 5100?"

Okabe: *I nod, my voice steady despite the pain wracking my body.* "That’s right. I heard you were an enthusiastic retro PC collector. Do you know anything about it?"

Faris’s Dad: *He chuckles, his eyes lighting up at the mention of his hobby.* "It’s quite unusual for a man your age to know about the IBN 5100. I did have one. I gave it away, though."

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat, a sudden wave of hope washing over me.* "You... gave it away?"
