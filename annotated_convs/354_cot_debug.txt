Planning: 

The scene primarily features Okabe Rintarou, Faris's Dad and Faris, with Okabe as the protagonist and POV character. Okabe is a quirky character, known for his dramatic flourishes, unique mannerisms, and a tendency to overthink. He should be characterized by a sense of theatricality, and his inner turmoil should be evident in his thoughts and actions. Faris's Dad is a businessman, mature and serious; his actions should reflect a sense of dignity and regret for his past actions. Faris is typically playful and energetic, often role-playing as a catgirl; however, in this scene, she's uncharacteristically serious, so her actions should be more subdued and earnest.

The dialogue's emotional weight centers around two main revelations: the connection between Suzuha and the IBN 5100, and the story behind Faris's kidnapping. Okabe's internal struggle with the decision he has to make regarding the D-Mail also adds to the tension. These will be the anchors of the scene.

Roleplay:

Faris’s Dad: *I shake my head, feeling a heavy weight on my heart.* "I don’t think Hashida-san, who entrusted the IBN 5100 to me, could ever forgive me for what I did..."

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Hashida? As in Hashida Suzu?" 

Faris’s Dad: *I nod solemnly, my gaze distant.* "This is an old story... a story from before my company got as big as it is. Rumiho was kidnapped. The kidnapper demanded an unthinkable ransom. Maybe I should have mortgaged the company instead. But at that moment, someone appeared, like a godsend, offering a large sum of money to buy my IBN 5100. I sold it, which gave me enough to prepare Rumiho’s ransom."

Faris: *I blush, feeling a mix of embarrassment and sadness.* "Let’s not talk about that, nya..."

Okabe: *I blink, trying to process everything I've just heard.* "So who was the buyer?"

Faris’s Dad: *I rub my chin, lost in thought.* "Hmm, a French businessman, I believe. I think I still have his contact information. Would you like it?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, my mind spinning with thoughts of the IBN 5100 and its possible whereabouts.* "No, thank you. That won't be necessary." *I clench and unclench my fist, feeling a mix of frustration and despair.*

Okabe: *I hear a knock on the door and look up, my eyes heavy with fatigue.* "Oh, Faris. Still awake?"

Faris: *I nod, stepping inside the room.* "May I come in?"

Okabe: *I gesture for her to sit, a silent invitation.* "Of course."

Faris: *I sit down next to him, my hands folded in my lap.* "...Um. Thanks for earlier. When the Viral gang started chasing me, I was really scared."
