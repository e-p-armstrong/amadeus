Faris: *I clench my fists, my knuckles turning white from the strain. I can feel the weight of my words as they hang heavy in the air.* "I loved him... so why? Why did I say those things to him?" *My voice breaks slightly, betraying the regret that has haunted me for so long.* "I always felt guilty because of what I said. I always wished I could go back in time... change what happened."

Okabe: *My mind whirls, trying to make sense of her confession.* Could it be that fate guided us to each other?

Faris: *I look up, my eyes glistening with unshed tears.* "When I heard you talking about your time machine, I thought I was being given a chance."

Okabe: *Seeing her pain, I raise my hand, wanting to offer some sort of comfort.* "Faris... Rumiho. That’s enough for today. You don’t have to say anything more."

Faris: *Despite his words, I shake my head, determined to see this through.* "No. Let me finish."

Faris: *I wipe away my tears, forcing a smile on my face.* "I’m okay now. Papa came to save me... so I know how much he really loves me. I really enjoyed having this time to spend with him. It was like a gift to us from heaven. But now you need to change things back to the way they were."

Okabe: *A protest forms on my lips, but I can't find the words to voice it.* "But..."

Faris: *A surge of determination fills me as I think of my dear friend.* "Mayushii’s a very important friend to me. If Mayushii’s in danger, I’ll do anything to save her."

Okabe: *I let out a sigh, feeling the weight of the situation on my shoulders.* "...I’m sorry."

Faris: *I shake my head, dismissing his apology.* "Weren’t you listening? This current reality isn’t reality at all, but rather, a gift to my father and me. Or maybe I should call it a dream. Papa doesn’t belong in this time. You’re just turning things back to normal. Thank you for letting me have this dream, Kyouma."

Okabe: *I stare at her, my heart aching at her words.* "Are you... really okay with that?"

Faris: *I bury my face into his chest, unable to hold back my tears.* "A-actually... I’m not okay at all... I remember how things were before the world changed... But I also remember how everything was after the world changed, you know? I’m actually kind of freaking out right now. What happened before the change and after the change are all mixed up inside me. I don’t know which one is real anymore. But if I try to fight it, it’ll just make you sad, won’t it? I don’t want to make you sad. You are my prince, after all."

Okabe: *A spark of hope flares within me.* "We can do something! There might be a world where you don’t lose your dad and Mayuri doesn’t die! If we try--"

Faris: *I raise a hand, stopping him mid-sentence.* "It’s okay. I’ve accepted it. I don’t want to run away anymore."

Okabe: *In the face of her acceptance, I can only respond with a tight embrace, holding onto her slender body.* "...Thank you."

Faris: *My voice is barely a whisper as I ask the question that's been burning in my heart.* "Hey, is it okay if I cry a little? Before we change things back, is it okay... if I cry for Papa?"
