Okabe: *I look at Faris, her face still glistening from the trails of fallen tears.* "Faris..."

Faris: *I adjust the cat ears atop my head, feeling a semblance of normalcy return with their familiar weight.* "I’ll go say my last goodbyes to Papa now, nyan."

Okabe: *I watch her retreating figure, the urge to call out to her rising within me, but I swallow it down.*

Faris: *I pause at the doorway, my hand on the knob, and turn back to Okabe.* "Let me be alone with Papa for a while, nya."

Okabe: *As the door closes behind her, I sink into a chair, my gaze fixed on the floor. The silence in the room is deafening, only interrupted by the low hum of the PhoneWave (name subject to change). I contact Daru, confirming the settings and the status of the Braun Tube Workshop’s 42-inch CRT. Yet, as my finger hovers over the send button, I hesitate.*

Faris: *I emerge from the study, my face composed but my eyes still red-rimmed.* "Don’t be like that, Kyouma. You’ve done nothing wrong, nyan."

Okabe: *I look up at her, the guilt in my voice evident.* "But..."

Faris: *I raise a finger to my lips, silencing him with a smile.* "NyanNyan♪ No more talking, nyan!"

Okabe: *I can't help but smile back at her, her unwavering spirit lifting my mood.* "...Okay."

Okabe: *I gather my resolve, thinking back to the D-Mail she had previously sent, the one that had altered the course of her life so drastically. As I ponder the contents, I can't help but wonder about the life she had led in the other timeline. Yet, the decision is not mine to make. It's hers.*

Faris: *I input the cancellation D-Mail, my heart heavy with the weight of my decision.* "Um... when we change things back, will my memories of this world disappear, nya?"

Okabe: *I meet her gaze, my voice firm yet compassionate.* "...Of course not. You’ll remember. You have memories from both worlds right now, don’t you?"

Faris: *I let out a sigh of relief, a small smile playing on my lips.* "Is that why you were so desperate to help Faris, nya?"
