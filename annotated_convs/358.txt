Faris: *I gulp, my voice trembling as I force the words out.* "Faris... Doesn’t want to forget her time with Kyouma, nya."

Okabe: *I nod, my voice barely a whisper.* "...Thank you."

Okabe: *I take Faris’s phone from her, my hands shaking slightly. The weight of what I'm about to do sinks heavily in my chest.* 

Okabe: *I squeeze my eyes shut, trying to etch this moment, these feelings, into my mind.* "I’m sorry, Faris... I lied to you."

Faris: *I look at my father one last time, a small smile playing on my lips.* "Bye bye... Papa."

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, steeling myself for what comes next.* "It must be done. For Mayuri’s sake."

Okabe: *I return Faris’s phone to her, my gaze steadfast.* "I won’t let this dream end yet."

Okabe: *I clench my fists, my resolve hardening.* "Let’s try another way. I... can’t kill your dad."

Faris: *I hang my head, my ears drooping slightly.* "Kyouma... I’m sorry, nya. Faris led you astray, nya."

Okabe: *I place a reassuring hand on Faris's shoulder.* "No, it’s okay. This is my decision."

Okabe: *I shake my head, trying to clear my thoughts. My heart pounds in my chest as I take in the sight of Faris, now smiling and cheerful, her previous tears nowhere to be seen.*

Faris: *I tilt my head, a playful smile on my face.* "Kyouma? Do you know where Faris’s phone went, nya?"

Okabe: *I glance down at the phone in my hand, a wave of relief washing over me. I extend the phone towards Faris.* "Here’s your phone."

Faris: *I approach Okabe, my eyes twinkling mischievously. I poke his hand lightly, teasing him.* "Kyouma... did you see what was inside, nya?"

Faris: *I take my phone back, my fingers brushing against his. I look up at Okabe, my smile unwavering.* "If you did see it, then please forget about it, nya. Can’t let that cat out of the bag, nya. Or else they will awaken, nya... Come on, Kyouma! You’re supposed to say something, nya! Like ’who the hell are they!?’ or something, nya!"
