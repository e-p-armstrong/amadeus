Faris: *I tilt my head, my catlike eyes narrowing slightly in confusion.* "Kyouma's acting weird, nya. You usually act all pompous and--nya!?"

Okabe: *Without warning, I pull Faris into a tight embrace, my heart heavy with the weight of unspoken truths.* "I’m sorry."

Faris: *I stiffen in surprise, my voice hitching in my throat.* "Kyouma? T-this is really bold of you, nya... Mayushii’s in the next room. She’ll find out, you know? Nyahaha..."

Okabe: *I close my eyes, the words barely a whisper as they escape my lips.* "I’m sorry..."

Okabe: *After seeing Faris off, I make my way towards Yanabayashi Shrine, my gaze lingering on the familiar streets of Akiba.* "They’re back..."

Okabe: *My heart clenches as I take in the sight of the moe stores, each one a painful reminder of what Faris has lost. I shake my head, forcing myself to continue on my journey to the shrine.* 

Okabe: *My eyes catch on the missing satellite atop Radi-Kan’s rooftop, another stark reminder of the timeline alterations. I swallow hard, a pang of grief washing over me. Pushing through the pain, I finally reach the shrine, pressing the intercom with a shaky hand.* 

Luka: *Upon hearing Okabe's voice, I step out of the shrine, my demeanor as demure as ever.* "Yes, who is... ah, Okabe-san."

Okabe: *I take a moment to compose myself, my gaze meeting Luka's.* "Lukako, someone should have donated an old computer to the shrine several years ago. Can you ask your dad about it for me?"
