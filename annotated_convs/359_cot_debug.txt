Planning/Brainstorming:

Characters Involved:
1. Okabe: A mad scientist persona, known for his eccentric behavior and over-the-top speeches, but underneath is a deeply caring individual who is driven by the desire to protect his friends. He carries the burden of time travel and the changes it incurs, often being the only one to remember altered timelines. 

2. Faris: A playful and cheerful character who speaks in a cat-like manner. She's always high-spirited, but in this scene, she's confused by Okabe's sudden change of behavior.

3. Luka: A shy, demure character who is in fact a boy but has the appearance and mannerisms of a girl. In this scene, she appears as a genuine girl due to the alterations in the timeline.

Writing Styles:
For Okabe, I'll use a mix of dramatic and poignant language to reflect his internal struggle and the weight of his actions. Faris's lines will carry an undertone of confusion and surprise, while Luka's will be imbued with her usual timidness and politeness. 

Anchors:
The lines "I'm sorry..." by Okabe will serve as anchors, showing his remorse and guilt over the changes he's made and the impact on Faris's life. I'll write these with a sense of melancholy and depth.

Roleplay:

Faris: *I tilt my head, my catlike eyes narrowing slightly in confusion.* "Kyouma's acting weird, nya. You usually act all pompous and--nya!?"

Okabe: *Without warning, I pull Faris into a tight embrace, my heart heavy with the weight of unspoken truths.* "I’m sorry."

Faris: *I stiffen in surprise, my voice hitching in my throat.* "Kyouma? T-this is really bold of you, nya... Mayushii’s in the next room. She’ll find out, you know? Nyahaha..."

Okabe: *I close my eyes, the words barely a whisper as they escape my lips.* "I’m sorry..."

Okabe: *After seeing Faris off, I make my way towards Yanabayashi Shrine, my gaze lingering on the familiar streets of Akiba.* "They’re back..."

Okabe: *My heart clenches as I take in the sight of the moe stores, each one a painful reminder of what Faris has lost. I shake my head, forcing myself to continue on my journey to the shrine.* 

Okabe: *My eyes catch on the missing satellite atop Radi-Kan’s rooftop, another stark reminder of the timeline alterations. I swallow hard, a pang of grief washing over me. Pushing through the pain, I finally reach the shrine, pressing the intercom with a shaky hand.* 

Luka: *Upon hearing Okabe's voice, I step out of the shrine, my demeanor as demure as ever.* "Yes, who is... ah, Okabe-san."

Okabe: *I take a moment to compose myself, my gaze meeting Luka's.* "Lukako, someone should have donated an old computer to the shrine several years ago. Can you ask your dad about it for me?"
