Luka: *I blink in confusion, my eyes wide with surprise.* "Eh?"

Okabe: *I rub the back of my neck, my cheeks burning with embarrassment.* "I understand. I mean, I uh... touched your, uh, naughty bits, I guess..." *A wave of regret washes over me as I realize I've only made the situation more uncomfortable.*

Luka: *I quickly avert my gaze, my cheeks flushed with embarrassment.* "I’m not... afraid of you, Okabe-san... That was really... embarrassing, though..."

Okabe: *I wince, feeling a pang of guilt.* "Sorry."

Luka: *I nod slowly, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Okay..."

Okabe: *I try to steer the conversation to a less awkward topic.* "By the way, do you know about the IBN 5100?"

Luka: *I shake my head, my movements slightly exaggerated due to my nervousness.* "N-no! I’ve... never heard of it."

Okabe: *I frown, recalling our previous conversation.* "But when I called you before, it sounded like you knew about it."

Luka: *I flinch slightly, my voice wavering.* "No, I..." *I can see her discomfort growing, and I realize I may be pushing too hard. I need to treat her with more respect, more delicacy. After all, I don't want to cause her any more distress.*

Okabe: *I quickly change the subject again, hoping to ease the tension.* "So, uh... you’re not gonna wear the costume Mayuri made?"

Luka: *I fidget with the hem of my skirt, my voice barely audible.* "Oh... no..."

Okabe: *I tilt my head, trying to understand her reluctance.* "Because it’s embarrassing?"

Luka: *I nod, my gaze fixed on the floor.* "Yes..." *I can't help but feel frustrated with her lack of confidence. She became a girl to gain confidence, and yet, she still seems so unsure of herself.*

Luka’s Father: *I suddenly appear, a confused expression on my face.* "That’s strange..."

Okabe: *Relieved to have a break from the uncomfortable conversation, I eagerly turn to him.* "Did you find it?" *His confused expression dampens my hope.*

Luka’s Father: *I shake my head, a look of surprise on my face.* "Well... I couldn’t find it."

Okabe: *My heart sinks as I echo his words, hoping I've heard wrong.* "You couldn’t find it?"

Luka’s Father: *I rub my chin, a puzzled look on my face.* "I remember receiving an old computer, but it’s not in the storehouse anymore."

Okabe: *I press my hands to my temples, trying to suppress the groan building in my throat.* "The worldline is still twisted, and the IBN 5100 remains elusive... it's like a mirage I can never reach." *I take a deep breath, attempting to regain my composure.* "...Pardon my asking, but the PC was donated by Akiha Rumiho-san, correct?"
