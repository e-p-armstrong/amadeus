Planning/Brainstorming:
1. Okabe: He is the main protagonist and the one who drives the story forward. His character is a blend of eccentricity, intelligence, and a deep sense of responsibility. He is usually flamboyant and dramatic, but in this scene, he is awkward and reflective, showing a more serious side to him. His actions will be characterized by hesitation, nervousness, and deep thought.
2. Luka: Luka is a shy and reserved character. He is gentle and quiet, often lacking confidence. His actions will be portrayed as timid, uncertain, and slightly flustered, often accompanied by blushing or averting eyes.
3. Luka's Father: Luka's father is a minor character in this scene. He is portrayed as a kind, but somewhat absent-minded, older man. His actions will reflect his confusion and surprise.

Anchor Line 1: Okabe: "I understand. I mean, I uh... touched your, uh, naughty bits, I guess..."
Anchor Line 2: Okabe: "...Pardon my asking, but the PC was donated by Akiha Rumiho-san, correct?"

Roleplay:

Luka: *I blink in confusion, my eyes wide with surprise.* "Eh?"

Okabe: *I rub the back of my neck, my cheeks burning with embarrassment.* "I understand. I mean, I uh... touched your, uh, naughty bits, I guess..." *A wave of regret washes over me as I realize I've only made the situation more uncomfortable.*

Luka: *I quickly avert my gaze, my cheeks flushed with embarrassment.* "I’m not... afraid of you, Okabe-san... That was really... embarrassing, though..."

Okabe: *I wince, feeling a pang of guilt.* "Sorry."

Luka: *I nod slowly, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Okay..."

Okabe: *I try to steer the conversation to a less awkward topic.* "By the way, do you know about the IBN 5100?"

Luka: *I shake my head, my movements slightly exaggerated due to my nervousness.* "N-no! I’ve... never heard of it."

Okabe: *I frown, recalling our previous conversation.* "But when I called you before, it sounded like you knew about it."

Luka: *I flinch slightly, my voice wavering.* "No, I..." *I can see her discomfort growing, and I realize I may be pushing too hard. I need to treat her with more respect, more delicacy. After all, I don't want to cause her any more distress.*

Okabe: *I quickly change the subject again, hoping to ease the tension.* "So, uh... you’re not gonna wear the costume Mayuri made?"

Luka: *I fidget with the hem of my skirt, my voice barely audible.* "Oh... no..."

Okabe: *I tilt my head, trying to understand her reluctance.* "Because it’s embarrassing?"

Luka: *I nod, my gaze fixed on the floor.* "Yes..." *I can't help but feel frustrated with her lack of confidence. She became a girl to gain confidence, and yet, she still seems so unsure of herself.*

Luka’s Father: *I suddenly appear, a confused expression on my face.* "That’s strange..."

Okabe: *Relieved to have a break from the uncomfortable conversation, I eagerly turn to him.* "Did you find it?" *His confused expression dampens my hope.*

Luka’s Father: *I shake my head, a look of surprise on my face.* "Well... I couldn’t find it."

Okabe: *My heart sinks as I echo his words, hoping I've heard wrong.* "You couldn’t find it?"

Luka’s Father: *I rub my chin, a puzzled look on my face.* "I remember receiving an old computer, but it’s not in the storehouse anymore."

Okabe: *I press my hands to my temples, trying to suppress the groan building in my throat.* "The worldline is still twisted, and the IBN 5100 remains elusive... it's like a mirage I can never reach." *I take a deep breath, attempting to regain my composure.* "...Pardon my asking, but the PC was donated by Akiha Rumiho-san, correct?"
