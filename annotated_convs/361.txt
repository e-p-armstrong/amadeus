Okabe: *My gaze sweeps across the room, taking in the familiar sight of the lab's interior. Two girls are here, Mayuri and Kurisu, each engrossed in their own world. As my eyes land on Mayuri, I can't help but question.* "Who is this ’Karin’?"

Mayuri: *I giggle, my eyes sparkling with amusement. I look up at Okabe, my hands playing with the hem of my shirt as I try to explain.* "Well, ’welcome back’ flows so well into ’Okarin,’ doesn’t it? When you put them together, it’s doubly delicious."

Okabe: *My brows furrow, and I cross my arms over my chest, not quite convinced by her explanation.* "It’s not delicious."

Mayuri: *I puff out my cheeks in a playful pout, my hands resting on my hips as I look at Okabe.* "It’s a greeting I can only use for Okarin, so why not? Ehehe!"

Okabe: *My gaze drifts away from Mayuri, scanning the room once more. Something seems off. Daru's presence is noticeably missing.* "Where’s Daru?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my fingers tapping on my chin as I think.* "Hmm, probably at MayQueen?"

Okabe: "MayQueen..." *I mutter, my mind racing with the implications. So that place is back too. I shake off my thoughts, focusing back on Mayuri.* "So when Faris said she had work, she meant at MayQueen... What about you, Mayuri? You work there too, don’t you?"

Mayuri: *I nod enthusiastically, my eyes wide with surprise at Okabe's question.* "’Course I do! You know that, Okarin. You’re so weird! Mayushii’s taking a break to prepare for ComiMa tomorrow."
