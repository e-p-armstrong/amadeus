Okabe: *As Kurisu's voice fades into the background, an unpleasant sound pierces through my ears. I feel my vision ripple, my flesh and soul momentarily pulling apart. I grip my right wrist, closing my eyes and taking deep, steadying breaths as I wait for my pulse to return to normal.* "Whew..."

Okabe: *Shaking off the lingering discomfort, I plant myself in a pipe chair, my mind whirring with plans and contingencies. I know the sacrifices I've made, the choices I've been forced to confront. I don’t want to sacrifice anyone else. I yearn for the foolish dream of a peaceful worldline. Time ticks away, but the dreaded events don't occur. My preparations are complete.

The familiar sound pierces my ears, my vision ripples, and the sensation of my flesh and soul separating momentarily grips me. I grip my wrist, close my eyes, and take deep breaths, waiting for my pulse to return to normal.* "Whew..."
