Character Personalities/Archetypes:

Okabe: Eccentric, melodramatic, and intelligent. He's also shown to be deeply caring and protective of his friends.

Itaru: Also known as Daru, he's a hardcore otaku, and often acts carefree. However, he can show serious concern when the situation calls for it.

Kurisu: Not in this scene, but important context: She's logical, responsible, but also empathetic and emotional under the surface. 

Plan:
1. Okabe's lines will be filled with determination, fear, and frustration. His *actions* will be dramatic, with a touch of desperation.
2. Daru's lines will show his panic and fear. His *actions* will be hurried and frantic.

Anchor Lines:
1. Okabe's line: "I won’t let you kill Mayuri!" — This will be made into a powerful declaration, a manifestation of Okabe's will to protect his friends at all costs.
2. Itaru's line: "What do I do, Okarin!?" — This will be an expression of Daru's helplessness and panic.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *As Kurisu's voice fades into the background, an unpleasant sound pierces through my ears. I feel my vision ripple, my flesh and soul momentarily pulling apart. I grip my right wrist, closing my eyes and taking deep, steadying breaths as I wait for my pulse to return to normal.* "Whew..."

Okabe: *Shaking off the lingering discomfort, I plant myself in a pipe chair, my mind whirring with plans and contingencies. I know the sacrifices I've made, the choices I've been forced to confront. I don’t want to sacrifice anyone else. I yearn for the foolish dream of a peaceful worldline. Time ticks away, but the dreaded events don't occur. My preparations are complete. I've set the stage, but the question remains: Will the Rounders come on this worldline?*

Okabe: *Just as the uncertainty begins to gnaw at me, my phone rings, jolting me out of my thoughts. It's Daru.* "Hello? Daru?"

Itaru: *His voice comes through in ragged gasps, the panic palpable.* "Haa, ugh, gh, haah..."

Okabe: *A cold wave of dread washes over me.* "Hey, what happened!? Daru!?"

Itaru: *His words tumble out in a desperate rush.* "I’m sor... some guys... came out of nowhere... they took Mayu-shi... I think... they wanted... me... I... ran... but Mayu-shi... What do I do, Okarin!?"

Okabe: *A heavy silence follows his words. It's the Rounders. They've taken Mayuri. My heart pounds in my chest as the grim reality sinks in. A surge of frustration rises within me, but I force it down, focusing on the task at hand. I toss the useless Moad Snake onto the couch, the painstaking preparations amounting to nothing.* 

Okabe: *I march towards the development room, determination burning in my chest.* "I won’t let you kill Mayuri!"

Okabe: *With that vow echoing in the room, I once again prepare to send my memories into the past. The familiar sound pierces my ears, my vision ripples, and the sensation of my flesh and soul separating momentarily grips me. I grip my wrist, close my eyes, and take deep breaths, waiting for my pulse to return to normal.* "Whew..."
