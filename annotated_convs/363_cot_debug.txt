Planning Stage:
- Okabe: The protagonist and a self-proclaimed mad scientist. His persona is eccentric and over-dramatic, though this often hides his deep intellect and caring nature. His *actions* and *thoughts* will be written with a mix of flamboyance and seriousness, reflecting his over-the-top personality but also his growing worry and guilt over the situation.
    - Anchoring lines: "That’s why I’m consulting you, so I can find a way to do this while hurting her the least." and "...If only I hadn’t been so careless. I shouldn’t have let so many people send D-Mails."
- Kurisu: A genius neuroscientist who is rational and pragmatic. She hides her emotions behind a wall of scientific objectivity, but cares deeply for those around her. Her *actions* will be subtle, and her *thoughts* will be analytical, reflecting her scientific mind and her hesitance to display open emotion.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, running a hand through my unkempt hair.* "Yes. I have a difficult problem that requires... delicacy to resolve."

Kurisu: *She raises an eyebrow at me, a small smirk playing at the corners of her mouth.* "Delicacy? That’s like the exact opposite of what anyone expects from you."

Okabe: *I frown, my eyes meeting hers, searching for understanding.* "That’s why I want to ask a girl. Plus, you’re my assistant, so I need you to save my ass this instant."

Kurisu: *She crosses her arms, curiosity piqued.* "Oh, you. Why do you need to ask a girl anyway?"

Okabe: *I lean in, my fingers clasping together as I tell her everything. The time leaps, Suzuha, Faris... and Lukako. It's a tale I've told too many times. But this time, her disbelief isn't as strong as before. Except for Lukako.*

Kurisu: *She leans back, her brow furrowing in disbelief.* "Urushibara-san is actually a guy? That’s totally ridiculous."

Okabe: *I nod, my gaze falling to the floor.* "But it’s the truth. Was the truth."

Kurisu: *She bites her lower lip, thinking.* "So basically, umm..."

Okabe: *I watch her, waiting for her to process the information.* 

Kurisu: *She suddenly looks up, her eyes wide.* "She looked like Hashida?"

Okabe: *A chilling image flashes across my mind, and I grimace in disgust.* "Ugh."

Kurisu: *She shakes her head, her cheeks pale.* "Ugh. Unacceptable! There’s no way such a cute girl was a guy."

Okabe: *I raise a hand, trying to calm her.* "Hey, hold your horses. I never said that Lukako looked like a guy. He actually looked pretty much the same. He was always androgynous, so much you couldn’t help but think he was secreting excess female hormones or something."

Kurisu: *Her eyes wander, lost in thought.* "He looked like she does now?"

Okabe: *I watch her, my hands clasping the can of Dr. P on the table, my grip tightening with frustration.* 

Kurisu: *She suddenly nods, a determined look on her face.* "Acceptable."

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback.* "Anyway. You want to turn her back into a guy?"

Kurisu: *She sighs, rubbing her temples.* "Unless we do, Mayuri dies."

Okabe: *I nod, my heart heavy.* "Mayuri’s life is tied to Urushibara-san’s gender... That’s so crazy it doesn’t seem real at all. Have you come up with a solution?"

Kurisu: *She looks at me, her expression serious.* "Of course. I’ll have Lukako turn back into a guy."

Okabe: *I shake my head, my fingers drumming on the table.* "I don’t know if she’s going to appreciate that."

Kurisu: *I take a deep breath, the weight of my words sinking in.* "That’s why I’m consulting you, so I can find a way to do this while hurting her the least."

Okabe: *I take a swig of Dr. P, the cold liquid doing little to quell my rising frustration.* "...If only I hadn’t been so careless. I shouldn’t have let so many people send D-Mails."

Kurisu: *She places a hand on my shoulder, her voice steady and calming.* "Regret won’t change anything. There’s only one piece of advice I can give."

Okabe: *I look at her, desperate for any kind of solution.* "Don’t say anything to Urushibara-san."

Kurisu: *I frown, my mind racing.* "What do you mean?"

Kurisu: *She leans back, her gaze meeting mine.* "Based on what you’ve told me, you have the advantage this time. You already know the contents of the D-Mail. So you don’t have to tell her -- him? Ex-him? ...You don’t have to tell Urushibara-san. Just send the cancellation D-Mail."

Okabe: *I consider her words, my heart pounding in my chest.* "You mean pose as Lukako and send the mail to her mother myself?"
