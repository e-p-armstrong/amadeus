Okabe: *I ponder, my thoughts echoing in the silence of the lab.* "Just one problem. I don’t know her mother’s pager number."

Kurisu: *I react instantly, my eyebrows knitting together in disbelief.* "What!? Are you an idiot!? Why didn’t you write it down!?"

Okabe: *I shrug, my hands spread out in a helpless gesture.* "I didn’t think I would need it!"

Kurisu: *I click my tongue, rubbing my brow with my fingers, muttering under my breath as I try to think of a solution.* "What if you just ask for the pager number directly? Think up a good excuse."

Okabe: *I shake my head, my eyes filled with uncertainty.* "That’s going to look suspicious..."

Kurisu: *I stare at Okabe, my gaze sharp yet filled with concern.* "What are you so scared of? That’s not the vain and arrogant Okabe I know."

Okabe: *I feel a jolt of surprise at her words.* Vain and arrogant? That was uncalled for. I don’t have time to be Hououin Kyouma now.

Kurisu: *I sigh, my eyes averted as I speak.* "Just make up some nonsense like you always do. I mean, you know how gullible she is, right? ...Wow, I hate myself for saying that. I’m a bad girl."

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu hangs her head, regret clear in her voice.* "Maybe I should just tell her the truth. Sincerity will work better than underhanded tricks... I think."

Kurisu: *I scoff, my lips curling into a half-smile.* "A mad scientist, sincere? That’s a good one. It’s more like you to say ’I’ll brainwash her, muhahaha!’."

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, feeling a wave of frustration.* I’m being serious, dammit! "I will shoulder Lukako’s pain. That’s my responsibility. When I cancel that D-Mail, the fact that she was a girl will be undone. I’m the only one who can carry that burden."

Kurisu: *I nod, my eyes sincere and supportive.* "So what are you talking to me for? Go to her now, and tell her what you told me."

Okabe: *I exhale, feeling the weight of my responsibility.* "Yeah... you’re right." That’s my only choice. As always, there are only a few worshipers at the shrine. I guess that’s how it can keep its dignified silence, even though it’s less than a 10 minute walk from Akihabara Station.

Luka: *I look up from my sweeping, my voice soft and hesitant.* "Ah, Okabe-san..."

Okabe: *I turn to Lukako, my gaze gentle.* "No, that’s okay."

Luka: *I blink, my eyes wide with surprise.* "R-really?"

Okabe: *I nod, trying to maintain a calm façade.* Well, crap. Now that we’re face to face, I can’t bring myself to tell her the truth.

Luka: *I tilt my head, looking at Okabe with confusion.* "Is... something wrong?"

Okabe: *I stammer, feeling my heart pound in my chest.* "W-well..." I recall Lukako’s crying face. She looked very sad when I called her a guy. If possible, I don’t want to make her cry again. No! Why am acting so weak!? I can’t stop here. I swore I would do anything to save Mayuri. And when Lukako said he wanted to be a girl, he probably only said it out of curiosity. If I explain everything properly, I doubt she’ll refuse to become a guy again.

Okabe: *I gather my resolve, looking straight into Lukako's eyes.* "Lukako!"

Luka: *I jump, startled by Okabe's sudden intensity.* "Uh, yes!?"

Okabe: *I reach out, grabbing her by the shoulders and pulling her close. Lukako’s cheeks instantly turn bright red.* "Please listen carefully. The truth is... You used to be a guy."
