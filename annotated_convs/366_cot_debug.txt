Planning:
- Kurisu is a strong, independent, and highly intelligent character. She's analytical, often seen dissecting situations with her scientific approach. However, she also has a softer side, often showing concern for others in her own way. Her actions and thoughts should reflect her analytical mind, using precise and intelligent language. Her movements are calculated and purposeful.
- Okabe is eccentric, dramatic, and highly emotional. He often overthinks situations, leading to bouts of anxiety and confusion. His actions and thoughts should reflect his emotional nature, using dramatic and sometimes exaggerated language. His movements are often bigger and more expressive.
- The anchor lines for this scene will be Kurisu's first line about love being trouble and Okabe's line about Lukako being a guy last week. These lines have significant emotional weight and will set the tone for the rest of the scene.

Roleplay:
Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, my gaze falling to the floor as I contemplate the complexity of the situation.* "Love is trouble." *I sigh, shaking my head as I try to rationalize the chaos of emotions.* "There’s no formula for calculating people’s feelings. Too many unknowns to solve for."

Okabe: *I watch her, a frown tugging at my lips. It's hard to believe that she, of all people, doesn't understand something.* "Has this girl never been in love?" *I wonder, my mind spinning with the implications.*

Kurisu: *I glance up at him, my eyes narrowing slightly in thought.* "The direct approach was a mistake. It’ll be even harder to persuade her now. You should think of another way this time. Like asking her mother directly." *I pause, a hint of amusement flickering across my features.* "Though I’m sure the Urushibara family already thinks of you as the man who made their daughter cry. So they might have their guard up."

Okabe: *I feel a knot forming in my stomach, my heart pounding uncomfortably in my chest.* "Lukako likes me? I don’t want to believe it. I mean, I appreciate the sentiment, but..." *I trail off, my mind reeling with confusion.*

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my palms starting to sweat.* "Um... when do you think I first set off that romance flag?"

Kurisu: *I shrug, my gaze drifting to the side.* "How should I know?"

Okabe: *I chew on my lower lip, my brow furrowing in thought.* "I mean, think about it. Lukako was a guy last week. If he already liked me at that point, then..."

Kurisu: *I cut him off, my voice firm and unyielding.* "That’s just your perspective. From everyone else’s perspective, she was always a girl. It makes perfect sense. Think in terms of the current worldline."

Okabe: *I blink, my mind going blank for a moment.* "R-right. It makes perfect sense. Still..."

Kurisu: *I interrupt his thoughts again, my tone serious.* "Anyway, there’s a bigger problem. Will changing Urushibara-san’s gender to male really bring the IBN 5100 back?"

Okabe: *I nod, my hands clasping together as I try to explain.* "Something is different from the previous worldline. According to Lukako’s father, the IBN 5100 was definitely at Yanabayashi Shrine. Suzuha gave it to Faris’s dad. After he died, Faris donated it to Yanabayashi Shrine... That sequence is the same as on the worldline where I obtain the IBN 5100."

Kurisu: *I tilt my head, my gaze thoughtful.* "So you’re gradually approaching the original worldline. You know, I’ve been thinking. You really shouldn’t be able to change the worldline so easily."

Okabe: *I frown, my mind racing to keep up.* "What makes you say that?"

Kurisu: *I look at him, my expression serious.* "I mean, there are six billion people in the world. It doesn’t make sense that switching a single person’s gender could cause such a huge change in the worldline."

Okabe: *I lean back, my heart pounding in my chest.* "According to Suzuha, taking different actions after a time leap will only change divergence by around 0. 000001%, if at all. But when I canceled Faris’s D-Mail, there was a 0. 05% change."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, my interest piqued.* "0. 05% is pretty big. What did Amane-san have to say about that?"

Okabe: *I meet her gaze, my voice steady despite the nervous energy coursing through me.* "The year 2010 is a major attractor field junction, and the key is whether or not I obtain an IBN 5100."

Kurisu: *I ponder his words, my mind racing to keep up.* "Maybe the divergence meter actually measures your distance to the IBN 5100... In any case, what you’re saying is that all of the D-Mails we sent had an influence on the IBN 5100’s location somehow?"

Okabe: *I nod, my hands clasping together as I try to piece together the puzzle.* "There were also some D-Mails that didn’t activate Reading Steiner."

Kurisu: *I frown, my gaze thoughtful.* "Hmmm. So just cancel the D-Mails that activated Reading Steiner, and the IBN 5100 might come back to you."
