Okabe: *I shake my head, pushing the image of that woman from my mind. My focus, for now, needs to be elsewhere.* "So what should I do about Lukako?"

Kurisu: *I tilt my head, a finger tapping against my chin in thought.* "Well, you tripped a romance flag, so... Hmm..."

Kurisu: *My brow furrows as I ponder, my eyes darting around the room as if searching for an answer.* "...Ah!" *Suddenly, a blush creeps up on my cheeks, and I quickly turn away, trying to hide it.*

Kurisu: *I stutter, my voice barely above a whisper.* "B-by the way, Okabe. Is there... someone you like? Wh-why aren’t you answering?"

Okabe: *I shrug, a nonchalant expression on my face.* "Not really." *Yet, for a fleeting moment, Mayuri’s face floats through my mind. But it's not romantic love I feel for her, more a strong desire to protect.*

Kurisu: *I nod, trying to hide the disappointment in my voice.* "Oh... okay."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, curiosity piqued.* "Why do you ask?"

Kurisu: *I wave my hands dismissively, my voice a little too high-pitched.* "Ah, no, just wondering! There’s no hidden meaning, okay!?"

Okabe: *I chuckle, unable to resist teasing her.* "Why are you mad? Also, your face is red."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms defensively, doing my best to feign annoyance.* "Is not! A-anyway! You should go out with Urushibara-san!"

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by her sudden change in topic.* "...Seriously?"

Kurisu: *I avoid his gaze, my voice barely audible.* "Y-you don’t like anyone else, right? Then answer her feelings, you dummy."

Okabe: *I can't help but chuckle at the name-calling, even though the situation is far from funny.* "Mayuri dies in two days. I don’t have time to play boyfriend."

Kurisu: *I insist, trying to sound more confident than I feel.* "Just go out with her."

Okabe: *I repeat, my voice turning serious.* "...Seriously?"

Kurisu: *I nod, trying to meet his gaze.* "If there’s nobody you like, then there’s no reason not to, is there? Get close and help her work through her feelings. Then she’ll probably tell you what you need to know."

Okabe: *I shake my head, frustration creeping into my voice.* "Mayuri dies in two days. I don’t have time for that touchy-feely stuff."

Kurisu: *Suddenly, my expression turns grave, my next words hanging heavy in the air.* "...Only consider this as a last resort. If you’re willing to hurt Urushibara-san, you can always take the information by force. She’ll forget after the worldline changes, won’t she? In that case, I think it’s a valid option. But only when compared to Mayuri’s death. ...I hate myself for suggesting this."

Okabe: *I nod, my expression equally somber.* "No, you’re right. I need to consider every possible option. But I don’t want to do that if there’s any other choice."
