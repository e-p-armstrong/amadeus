Roleplay:

Okabe: *I glance up from my work, surprised to see Mayuri entering the room, her usual cheery demeanor replaced by a pout.* "You’re early. It’s still eight. Something happening today?"

Mayuri: *I plant my hands on my hips, my gaze stern.* "I’m here to scold you, Okarin!"

Okabe: *Despite the serious tone, I can't help but smile at the sight of her glaring at me, a gesture more endearing than intimidating.* "What did I do?"

Mayuri: *I thrust a finger at Okabe, my cheeks puffing out in indignation.* "You can’t fool me, Okarin. You made Luka-chan cry, didn’t you?"

Okabe: *I feel a pang of guilt, my smile fading quickly.* "H-how did you..."

Mayuri: *I cross my arms over my chest, my brows knitting together in a frown.* "Luka-chan told me. She said you said she was a guy."

Okabe: *I let out a sigh, cursing myself for forgetting how close Mayuri and Lukako are.* "Damn..."

Mayuri: *I take a step towards Okabe, my voice softening.* "Why would you say such a mean thing, Okarin?"

Okabe: "M-Mayuri, it doesn’t involve you. This is a serious, confidential matter involving the Organization--"

Mayuri: *I cut him off, my voice firm.* "It does too involve me. Luka-chan is Mayushii’s friend! If you don’t tell me, we’re not friends anymore, okay? I’m gonna quit being a lab mem!"

Okabe: *Her words hit me like a punch to the gut. This is the first time I've ever seen Mayuri so angry, and I'm at a loss for how to respond.* "Why did you say such a mean thing?"

Okabe: *My mind races, trying to find a way to explain without revealing the grim truth. I did what I had to do to save her, but I can't tell her that. Not when it means telling her she's doomed to die in just two days.*

Mayuri: *I study Okabe closely, my earlier anger replaced by concern.* "...You’re worried about something, aren’t you?"

Mayuri: *I offer him a small smile, my voice gentle as I continue.* "I can tell. I’ve been watching you longer than anyone, Okarin... And yesterday, you talked with Chris-chan for a looong time, didn’t you? If something’s wrong, you should talk to Mayushii too, okay? I want to help too... okay? Now, let’s go apologize to Luka-chan. Will you do that for me? Mayushii will come too, so let’s--"

Okabe: *I interrupt her, my laughter echoing in the room as I throw my head back.* "Heh... heh heh heh, muhahahaha!"

Mayuri: *I take a step back, startled by his sudden outburst.* "O-Okarin?"

Okabe: *I straighten up, my eyes gleaming with a mad light as I fall into my 'mad scientist' persona.* "Come now, Mayuri. Me, worry? Don’t be ridiculous! I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma! I have nothing to worry about! All I have... is the hunger for chaos! Muhahahaha!"

Mayuri: *I watch him quietly, a look of hurt and confusion on my face.* "Okarin..."

Okabe: *Seeing her like this tears at me, but I can't tell her the truth. I can't let her share in my burden, not when it could put her in danger.* "Alright..."
