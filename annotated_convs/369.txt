Okabe: *I run my fingers through my hair, the decision weighing heavily on me.* "I’m going to Lukako’s."

Mayuri: *Her eyes sparkle with concern, her fingers nervously playing with the hem of her dress.* "Really? You’re going to apologize? Then let Mayushii come too!"

Okabe: *I shake my head, my gaze filled with determination.* "No, that will just make it harder." *I put my hand on Mayuri’s shoulder, trying to reassure her.* "Please, take care of the lab while I’m gone."

Mayuri: *Her shoulders droop, a sense of sadness washing over her, but she nods and lets me leave. As I reach the shrine, I find Lukako standing alone in the courtyard, clad in regular clothes instead of her miko garb, seemingly lost in thought. I take a moment to watch her, the wind playing with her hair, the trees swaying gently in the summer breeze. It feels like a scene straight out of a movie.* 

Okabe: *I clear my throat, breaking the silence.* "...Ahem."

Luka: *She turns around, surprise flashing in her eyes before she bows her head in respect.* "You came... Thank you."

Okabe: *We stand there, an awkward silence enveloping us. I can't stand the tension, so I break it.* "What did you tell Mayuri?"

Luka: *She stammers, her voice barely a whisper.* "...S-sorry. But Mayuri-chan’s the only one I could talk to about this."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, curiosity piqued.* "I mean, how much did you tell her?"

Luka: *She looks down, her fingers fidgeting with the hem of her shirt.* "I kept most of it a secret. Especially the stuff about her dying..."

Okabe: *I let out a sigh of relief.* "Do you still think I’m joking?"

Luka: *She shakes her head, her eyes filled with sincerity.* "No, I believe you."

Okabe: *I try to lighten the mood, but end up sounding like Faris.* "Umm, you said you had something important to talk about, nya?"

Luka: *She takes a deep breath, her face turning a shade of red.* "...Um."

Okabe: *I can see her struggling to find the words, her tension starting to affect me.* "What is it, Lukako?"

Luka: *She struggles to form a coherent sentence, her voice shaking.* "I..."

Okabe: *I lean forward, eager to hear what she has to say.* "Y-yes?"

Luka: *She swallows hard, her gaze fixed on the ground.* "...want to ask..."

Okabe: *I nod, trying to encourage her to continue.* "Yes?"

Luka: *Her voice is barely a whisper, her fingers tightly clenched.* "Okabe-san... about what you said yesterday..."

Okabe: *I tilt my head, trying to recall our previous conversation.* "Yeah."

Luka: *She looks up, determination in her eyes.* "I... believe you."

Okabe: *A wave of relief washes over me.* "T-that’s great!"

Luka: *But something about her seems off. She looks like she's on the verge of tears.* "...so, well... In exchange... for becoming a guy again..."

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat. She wants something in return?* "What is it, Lukako?"

Luka: *She struggles to find the words, her voice trembling.* "For today... and tomorrow... We can stop... before Mayuri-chan is in danger..."

Okabe: *I feel my throat go dry. What is she trying to say?* "Go on..."

Luka: *Her voice is barely audible, her face turning a deep shade of red.* "...so... Please be my..."

Okabe: *I lean forward, straining to hear her words.* "...Hm? I couldn’t hear you. One more time."
