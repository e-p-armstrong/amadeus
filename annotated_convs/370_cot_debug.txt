Planning stage:
- Okabe: A bit eccentric and dramatic, his thoughts and actions should reflect this by being overly descriptive and somewhat exaggerated. This is a moment of panic and confusion for him, so his thoughts and actions will be frantic and disjointed.
- Luka: Shy and soft-spoken, her actions should be small and nervous, reflecting her fear and hope in this moment.
- Mayuri: Cheerful and carefree, her actions should be bubbly and energetic, reflecting her innocence and obliviousness to Okabe's panic.
- Kurisu: Serious and intelligent, her actions should be focused and precise, showing her concentration on her work.

Anchors:
- Luka's confession: This is the moment that drives the rest of the scene. The weight of her words needs to be conveyed.
- Okabe's time leap: This is his desperate escape from the situation, showing his inability to handle the situation.

Roleplay:

Luka: *I stutter, my words barely audible as I try to voice my feelings.* "Please be my b...end"

Okabe: *I strain my ears, the blood rushing in my head drowning out her words.* "Speak up. I’ll do anything I can."

Luka: *I swallow, the lump in my throat making it hard to speak.* "Boy...end..."

Okabe: *I blink, confusion washing over me.* "What?"

Luka: *I gather all my courage, my voice shaking as I finally say it.* "P-please be my boyfriend!"

Okabe: *My mind goes blank, the word echoing in my head. The world around me seems to slow down as I try to process what she just said.* "Wh-why?" *I blurt out, immediately regretting my choice of words as I see her flinch.*

Luka: *I lower my head, my voice barely a whisper.* "I... ...like you."

Okabe: *My heart beats loudly in my ears, drowning out everything else. I stare at her, unable to form words. My mind is a whirlwind of thoughts, none of them coherent. I need to escape, to collect my thoughts.* "L-let me think about it! Give me two -- no, five minutes!" *I turn and run, my heart pounding in my chest, my face burning with embarrassment.*

Mayuri: *I greet Okabe cheerfully, unaware of his inner turmoil.* "Okarin! How’d it go? Did you apologize to Luka-chan?"

Okabe: *I try to act normal, my words tumbling out in a rush.* "Uh, yeah. So put the Juicy Chicken Number One in the microwave and nuke it so that the D-Mail’s basically ABC and..."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, confused by his rambling.* "Huwha?"

Okabe: *I start setting up the Time Leap Machine, my hands shaking slightly.* "The microwave was developed by knights of the Rosicrucian Order who used alchemy. Meaning that the sound of the chime is the brainwashing device, while the chime itself actually doesn’t have any meaning at all..."

Mayuri: *I stare at Okabe, my eyes wide with worry.* "Waaah, Okarin’s broken!"

Okabe: *I ignore her, focusing on the Time Leap Machine.* "M-making a tactical retreat."

Mayuri: *I blink, not understanding what he means.* "Retreat...?"

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, preparing myself for the leap. I need to escape, to put as much distance between me and this situation as possible.* "How far do I go? As far as I can. Yeah, that’s it. Far. Far away from here."

Kurisu: *I glance up from my work, annoyed by Okabe's staring.* "Stop staring. You’re distracting me. How many times do I have to tell you?"
