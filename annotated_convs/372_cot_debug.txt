Outline and planning:

The scene involves several characters from the visual novel Steins;Gate, namely Okabe, Kurisu, Luka, and Mayuri. Okabe, the protagonist, is a somewhat eccentric, dramatic individual prone to bouts of laughter and grandiose monologues. Kurisu, on the other hand, is a brilliant scientist with a serious, no-nonsense demeanor, but she occasionally shows a softer side. Luka is a gentle, shy character, often hesitant in her speech and actions. Mayuri is an innocent, cheerful, and slightly naive character, often providing the light-hearted moments in the story.

Given these character traits, I will portray Okabe with a mix of bravado and internal turmoil, Kurisu with a blend of irritation and hidden concern, Luka with a mix of hesitance and hope, and Mayuri with a balance of light-hearted cheer and seriousness.

The first anchor line will be Okabe's line: "Y-you’re actually a guy." This line reveals a pivotal moment in the story and its delivery should reflect the awkwardness and discomfort of the situation. 

The second anchor line will be Luka's line: "P-please be my boyfriend!" This line is loaded with emotion and vulnerability, and it will be crafted to reflect Luka's anxiety and anticipation.

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, my brow furrowing as I stare at Okabe.* "I’m just treating her like a valuable test sub--"

Okabe: *I throw my hands up in exasperation, cutting her off.* "Go back to the lab, you experiment-loving girl!"

Kurisu: *My lips press into a thin line, my eyes flickering with annoyance.* "Yeah, okay. So that’s the thanks I get for going out of my way to help you. I’m gone. You’re on your own now." *With a huff, I turn on my heel, leaving the shrine with squared shoulders, muttering darkly to myself.*

Luka: *My fingers nervously twist the hem of my shirt as I step forward.* "Um... what was Makise-san talking about?"

Okabe: *I draw in a deep breath, my fingers drumming on my thighs.* "Well, basically... Y-you’re actually a guy." *I blurt it out, my heart pounding in my chest. The world outside seems to quieten, the tweeting of small birds the only sound.*

Mayuri: *I push open the door, my eyes scanning the room until they land on Okabe.* "Okarin? There you are!" *I cross my arms over my chest, my lips curving into a disapproving pout.* "Mayushii’s very disappointed in you!" *I point a finger at him, my cheeks puffing out in frustration.* "You made Luka-chan cry, didn’t you? Luka-chan told me. She said you said she was a guy. Why would you say such a mean thing, Okarin?"

Okabe: *I run a hand through my hair, the weight of my actions sinking in.* "...I’m going to see her now, so don’t worry."

Mayuri: *My eyes widen, relief washing over me.* "R-really? Thank goodness. If you weren’t gonna apologize, then Mayushii was never gonna talk to you again."

Okabe: *I bite down on my lower lip, my gaze drifting to my phone.* "Christina! Christina!" *I start yelling towards the development room, the anticipation building as I hear the sounds of someone stirring.*

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, my brow furrowing in concern.* "Is Chris-chan sleeping? She worked all night, so you shouldn’t wake her up."

Okabe: *I clench my fists, determination hardening my gaze.* "Christina! Please wake up!"

Kurisu: *I emerge from the development room, rubbing my eyes sleepily.* "...Oh, shut up."

Mayuri: *I break into a bright smile, my worries momentarily forgotten.* "Chris-chan, tutturu♪"
