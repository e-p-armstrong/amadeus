Okabe: *I take a deep breath, steadying my nerves as I turn to face Luka.* "I’m going to Yanabayashi Shrine. Come with me. It’s time for Operation Christina II."

Luka: *I falter, my words barely more than a whisper, each one taking a toll on me.* "Until... the 15th... We can stop... before Mayuri-chan is in danger... ...so... Please be my... Please be my b...end... Boy...end... P-please be my boyfriend!"

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by the sudden proposition. This is not what I expected, but I have a plan. I just have to stick to it.* "E-excuse me. I need a moment." *I turn my back to Luka, pulling out my phone and dialing Kurisu's number.*

Kurisu: *My voice filters through the phone, laced with amusement.* "Sup, you filthy normal?"

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, my grip tightening on the phone.* "Who’s a normal? Think about how I feel for once. Did you hear what Lukako said just now?"

Kurisu: "No. Fill me in."

Okabe: *I sigh in exasperation, pinching the bridge of my nose.* "You weren’t listening!?"

Kurisu: *A dry chuckle escapes my lips.* "How am I supposed to listen from all the way over here?"

Okabe: "She confessed. Until the 15th. Then back to manhood."

Kurisu: *I hum in understanding, my tone nonchalant.* "Roger. And? Why are you asking me? Just grant Urushibara-san’s wish."

Okabe: *I stutter, my mind racing to find a solution.* "B-but it’s Lukako!"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, a smirk playing on my lips.* "What’s wrong with her? I mean, look how cute she is."

Okabe: *I open my mouth to protest, but no words come out.* "But she’s a--"

Kurisu: *My voice is firm, cutting him off.* "Her being a guy might just be your imagination. From my perspective, she’s always been a girl."

Okabe: *I swallow hard, feeling the weight of her words.* "Gh..."

Kurisu: *I chuckle, ending the conversation abruptly.* "Just give up. Bye."

Okabe: *I stare at the phone in disbelief, my words dying in my throat.* "Ah, wai--" *The line goes dead, leaving me alone with my thoughts. I curse under my breath and shove my phone back into my pocket, steeling myself as I turn back to face Luka.*

Luka: *I watch him anxiously, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Um... were you on the phone... with Makise-san?"

Okabe: *I rub the back of my neck, avoiding her gaze.* "Hm? Oh, yeah..."

Luka: *I lower my gaze, my voice barely audible.* "Oh... You looked like you were having fun..."

Okabe: *I stiffen, feeling a knot forming in my stomach.* "N-nonsense."

Luka: *I take a deep breath, gathering my courage.* "So..." 

Okabe: *I watch her as she fidgets, my heart pounding in my chest. I feel a sense of dread creeping up on me.*

Luka: *I lift my gaze to meet his, my voice trembling.* "Your... answer..."
