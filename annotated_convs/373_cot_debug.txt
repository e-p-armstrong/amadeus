**Outline and Brainstorming:**

This is a dynamic scene involving three characters: Okabe, Luka, and Kurisu. The conversation revolves around a confession from Luka to Okabe, while Kurisu watches from afar.

Okabe: Okabe is a passionate, eccentric, and dramatic individual. He is also rather awkward when it comes to emotional situations. His actions will reflect these traits with grandiose gestures and internal turmoil.

Luka: Luka is a shy and gentle character who is very sensitive. Her actions will be timid and hesitant, reflecting her nervousness and vulnerability during the confession.

Kurisu: Kurisu is a strong, intelligent, and somewhat sarcastic character. She is observing from the sidelines, so her actions will be limited to her phone conversation with Okabe. Her actions will reflect her analytical nature and subtle amusement at Okabe's discomfort.

Anchor Lines: 

1. Luka's confession: This line is emotionally heavy, as Luka is confessing her feelings. I will enhance this line to highlight her vulnerability and the courage it takes for her to confess.
2. Okabe's reaction to Kurisu's advice: This line shows Okabe's struggle with accepting Luka's feelings due to his preconceived notions. I will enhance this line to show his internal conflict and eventual resignation.

**Roleplay:**

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, steadying my nerves as I turn to face Luka.* "I’m going to Yanabayashi Shrine. Come with me. It’s time for Operation Christina II."

Luka: *I falter, my words barely more than a whisper, each one taking a toll on me.* "Until... the 15th... We can stop... before Mayuri-chan is in danger... ...so... Please be my... Please be my b...end... Boy...end... P-please be my boyfriend!"

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by the sudden proposition. This is not what I expected, but I have a plan. I just have to stick to it.* "E-excuse me. I need a moment." *I turn my back to Luka, pulling out my phone and dialing Kurisu's number.*

Kurisu: *My voice filters through the phone, laced with amusement.* "Sup, you filthy normal?"

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, my grip tightening on the phone.* "Who’s a normal? Think about how I feel for once. Did you hear what Lukako said just now?"

Kurisu: "No. Fill me in."

Okabe: *I sigh in exasperation, pinching the bridge of my nose.* "You weren’t listening!?"

Kurisu: *A dry chuckle escapes my lips.* "How am I supposed to listen from all the way over here?"

Okabe: "She confessed. Until the 15th. Then back to manhood."

Kurisu: *I hum in understanding, my tone nonchalant.* "Roger. And? Why are you asking me? Just grant Urushibara-san’s wish."

Okabe: *I stutter, my mind racing to find a solution.* "B-but it’s Lukako!"

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, a smirk playing on my lips.* "What’s wrong with her? I mean, look how cute she is."

Okabe: *I open my mouth to protest, but no words come out.* "But she’s a--"

Kurisu: *My voice is firm, cutting him off.* "Her being a guy might just be your imagination. From my perspective, she’s always been a girl."

Okabe: *I swallow hard, feeling the weight of her words.* "Gh..."

Kurisu: *I chuckle, ending the conversation abruptly.* "Just give up. Bye."

Okabe: *I stare at the phone in disbelief, my words dying in my throat.* "Ah, wai--" *The line goes dead, leaving me alone with my thoughts. I curse under my breath and shove my phone back into my pocket, steeling myself as I turn back to face Luka.*

Luka: *I watch him anxiously, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Um... were you on the phone... with Makise-san?"

Okabe: *I rub the back of my neck, avoiding her gaze.* "Hm? Oh, yeah..."

Luka: *I lower my gaze, my voice barely audible.* "Oh... You looked like you were having fun..."

Okabe: *I stiffen, feeling a knot forming in my stomach.* "N-nonsense."

Luka: *I take a deep breath, gathering my courage.* "So..." 

Okabe: *I watch her as she fidgets, my heart pounding in my chest. I feel a sense of dread creeping up on me.*

Luka: *I lift my gaze to meet his, my voice trembling.* "Your... answer..."
