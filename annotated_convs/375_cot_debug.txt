Plan:

- This scene takes place in a maid cafe and features Kurisu and Okabe, two main characters from the series.
- Okabe is a quirky, theatrical character who often takes on the persona of "Hououin Kyouma," a mad scientist. He's prone to grandiose statements and over-the-top reactions.
- Kurisu is a serious, intelligent young woman who is often exasperated by Okabe's antics. She's also a bit socially awkward.
- In this scene, Kurisu is giving Okabe advice on dating. There's a lot of comedic potential here, with Okabe's over-the-top reactions and Kurisu's straight-laced, awkward advice.
- The two anchor lines will be Okabe's "I am the great Hououin Kyouma..." and Kurisu's advice on dating. The first line encapsulates Okabe's eccentric personality and the second line shows Kurisu's serious, detail-oriented nature.
- I'll be sure to highlight Okabe's theatricality and Kurisu's awkwardness in their *actions* and *thoughts*.

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I cross my arms and look Okabe squarely in the eyes, my tone serious.* "You made this choice to save Mayuri. So I’ll change my way of thinking too. Anyway, do you have any plans for your date tomorrow?"

Okabe: *I rub the back of my neck, feeling a twinge of unease. I still haven't figured out what I'm going to do on this date. I'm doing it to save Mayuri, but the whole thing feels... awkward.* "Date plans. I told Lukako I’d come up with something by tomorrow. So far, I’ve made no progress."

Kurisu: *My brow furrows in concern.* "Well, do you?"

Okabe: *I straighten up, a familiar spark igniting in my eyes.* "T-this calls for Hououin Kyouma..."

Okabe: *I puff out my chest, adopting a dramatic pose.* "...I have only one thing to say, assistant mine. I am the great Hououin Kyouma, a mad scientist with an IQ rivaling that of Isaac Newton himself!"

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, unimpressed.* "And?"

Okabe: *I continue with my mad scientist spiel, gesticulating wildly.* "Naturally, as a mad scientist, I have no interest in this thing mortals call love. My incredible brain is devoted to the destruction of the System that controls the world, and the birth of a new age of chaos!"

Kurisu: *A laugh escapes me before I can stop it.* "You’re obviously a virgin, thank you ver-- ...Hah!? ...P-pretend you didn’t just hear that."

Okabe: *I point an accusing finger at her, my face turning red.* "Damn you, assistant! How dare you point out the truth so bluntly! I won’t forget this insult!"

Kurisu: *I cringe, regretting my words.* "S-sorry..."

Okabe: *I cross my arms, a smirk on my face.* "And what about you!? Your experience must be vast indeed if you think you can lecture me about it!"

Kurisu: *I look away, my cheeks turning red.* "Ugh..."

Okabe: *I notice her discomfort and can't help but feel a small sense of victory.* "That’s what I thought! You spend all your time on research, so you’ve got zero experience, don’t you!? You must’ve been awfully lonely in America, huh!?"

Kurisu: *I snap, my voice coming out louder than I intended.* "Shut up! What’s wrong with being a virgin!? ...Hah!? Ah... awhawha..."

Okabe: *I can't help but laugh at her reaction.* "The genius girl who cried ’virgin’ at the center of Akiba..."

Okabe: *I glance around, noticing a few pedestrians grinning at Kurisu's outburst. I wouldn't be surprised to see it plastered across the blogosphere.*

Kurisu: *I blush fiercely, suddenly desperate to get out of the public eye.* "L-let’s get out of here!"

Kurisu: *Once we're inside the maid cafe, I start rattling off advice, trying to regain some semblance of control.* "What’s important for a first date is to make a good impression. An unclean appearance is out of the question. A haircut is especially important. Long hair looks dirty, so it’s no good. For clothes, you should wear something exactly the right size. Though it may be trendy, especially in Akiba, for young men to wear baggy clothes, it looks sloppy, so it’s not good."

Okabe: *I sit across from her in the cafe, my head spinning from all her advice. Why am I taking dating tips from my assistant, who's also a girl?*

Kurisu: *I continue, trying to ignore the absurdity of the situation.* "On the first date, conversation tends to break due to mutual nervousness. What’s important is to play ’conversation catch’. One-sided conversations aren’t fun for the other side. Girls especially like to talk, so the guy should try to keep the conversation going. Not just by listening. Throwing in appropriate responses is also necessary. Responsiveness gives the girl the impression that you’re really listening to her. Basically, you need to be the opposite of yourself. Anyway, focus on acting normal for now. No more of that idiotic laughter. You’re too heavy-handed with girls. You talk too pompously. You fire off nonsensical delusions."
