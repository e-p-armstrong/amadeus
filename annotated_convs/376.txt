Okabe: *I glance over at Kurisu, who's sitting across from me, engrossed in the pages of the dating manual we'd picked up on our way here. It's a peculiar sight, the two of us, arguably the least experienced in matters of the heart, studying romance as if it were a scientific theorem.* "Who are you calling an American virgin?"

Kurisu: *She lifts her head, her eyes flashing with indignation.* "Who else but you?"

Okabe: *I smirk, poking fun at her discomfort.* "Yeah, sure thing, virgin. There’s a saying. ’A fortress is judged by how many attacks it repulses; a soldier is judged by how many fortresses he takes.’"

Kurisu: *She huffs, crossing her arms defensively.* "That’s not a saying. Don’t look so proud of yourself."

Kurisu: *She looks back down at the manual, her eyes scanning the pages as if seeking refuge in the printed words.* "...You’re right. This is a dumb argument. Anyway, this dating manual actually says some pretty interesting things."

Kurisu: *I watch as she flips through the manual, her slender fingers brushing against the glossy pages.* "Like ’when walking down the street, be sure to put yourself between your date and the road’ or ’whatever you do, don’t make the girl pay for anything’. Okay! For your date tomorrow, make sure you follow all of these rules."

Okabe: *I scratch the back of my head, feeling a mix of amusement and apprehension.* "Can I really be that careful..."

Kurisu: *She doesn't seem to notice my hesitation, her eyes still glued to the book.* "And after that, there’s... carry a clean handkerchief. Spread it out when the girl goes to sit on a park bench."

Okabe: "I’m not her butler."

Kurisu: *She simply shrugs, flipping to the next page.* "But that’s what the book says. When it’s time to eat, avoid fast food of all kinds. Family restaurants are borderline acceptable. Anything else depends on your budget."

Okabe: "Family restaurants are borderline..." *I start thinking about where the family restaurants in Akiba are.*

Kurisu: "Arrive at the meeting place at least 15 minutes early. Tardiness is unacceptable."

Okabe: "15 minutes early..."

Kurisu: "Then you just need to decide where to take her. Movies, art galleries, strolling through town, and food are all safe."

Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, the tension in my shoulders easing slightly.* "I see. It’s easier than I thought." *I let out a soft sigh, a ghost of a smile tugging at the corners of my mouth.* "I was under the impression that a first date required going to a beautiful beach resort, exchanging your first kiss bathed in the light of the setting sun, and stuff like that."

Kurisu: *Her eyes widen, a faint blush spreading across her cheeks.* "Ah, that’s really romantic!" *She quickly regains her composure, though the blush remains.* "...I mean, that’s virgin imagination at full throttle. You’ve read too much manga."

Okabe: "You too."

Kurisu: "Besides, your date’s a minor, so don’t even think about bringing her to a hotel, okay?"

Okabe: "...What do you take me for?" *I can't help but feel a pang of discomfort at the thought. That way lie... forbidden lusts. Not to mention, Lukako’s such an innocent girl. If I brought her to a hotel, she’d probably faint from shock.*

Kurisu: "That just about covers it. Well? Was my lecture helpful?"

Okabe: "You mean the manual’s lecture." *I can't help but smirk, feeling a bit relieved. So, strolling around town counts as a date, huh? In that case, I don’t have to waste money.*

Faris: "Nyanya? Kyouma, are you going on a date, nya?" *She suddenly appears at our table, holding a tray of drinks with a playful grin on her face.*

Faris: "Thanks for waiting! I’ll prepare your iced coffee, nyan♪" *She starts pouring milk and syrup into my coffee, her movements swift and practiced. Kurisu watches this with great interest. I guess this is her first time at a maid cafe.*

Faris: "Is Mayushii the lucky girl, nya?" *She looks at me with a teasing smile, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.*
