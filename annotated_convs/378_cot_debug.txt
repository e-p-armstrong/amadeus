### Planning:

#### Characters:
- Luka: A gentle, shy, and soft-spoken young man who is often mistaken for a girl due to his feminine appearance. His actions and thoughts will be full of insecurity, hesitation, and confusion.
- Okabe: A self-proclaimed mad scientist who often acts larger than life, with dramatic speeches and grand gestures. His actions and thoughts will be theatrical, passionate, and determined.
- Low-Angler A & B: Rude and insensitive photographers who have a disrespectful attitude towards cosplayers. Their actions and thoughts will be crude, dismissive, and confrontational.

#### Anchors:
- Luka's reveal of his gender will be one of the anchors. The shock and emotional weight of the scene will be portrayed through vivid descriptions of the characters' reactions and the atmosphere. 
- Okabe's speech to Luka, offering him power and courage, will be the second anchor. This will be depicted in a dramatic and inspiring manner, fitting Okabe's character.

### Roleplay:

Luka: *I gulp, my hands trembling slightly as I clutch at the fabric of my miko robe.* "Um, I’m a..."

Okabe: *I straighten my posture, my voice echoing through the street with a fierce conviction.* "A cameraman who frightens a sacred miko is no cameraman at all! He’s nothing but lowlife scum, unfit to walk the holy streets of Akiba!"

Low-Angler A: *I recoil, my eyes widening in disbelief.* "Wh-what!? Everyone’s aiming for low-angle shots of cute 3D girls!"

Low-Angler B: *I scoff, crossing my arms over my chest defiantly.* "Amateur cosplayers should take what they get. When you cosplay in Akiba, you’re asking to get photographed! That’s how it works."

Luka: *I shudder, my voice barely above a whisper as I muster the courage to speak.* "N-no... I... I’m... A guy!" 

Okabe: *The words hang in the air, causing me to freeze in shock. My eyes widen, and I feel my jaw slacken involuntarily.*

Luka: *I drop my gaze, my voice sounding dejected.* "So... there’s no point in photographing me..."

Low-Angler A: *I blink rapidly, my mind struggling to process the revelation.* "R-really?"

Low-Angler B: *I stare at Luka, a mix of disbelief and denial etched on my face.* "No way. Someone this cute can’t be a guy..."

Luka: *I lift my chin slightly, exposing my neck. My voice is steady, but there's a hint of sadness in my eyes.* "I am a guy.... I even have an Adam’s apple..."

Okabe: *Lukako's gesture was enchanting, yet a noticeable lump on his neck, a testament to his truth, was indeed there.*

Low-Angler A: *I swallow hard, my voice sounding more like a croak.* "Then, you’ve got one down there, too?"

Luka: *I nod, the tears welling up in my eyes finally spilling over.* "Yes..." 

Okabe: *I watch as the photographers' eyes well up with tears, their faces a picture of disappointment and betrayal.*

Low-Angler B: *I snap, my voice harsh with accusation.* "Wh-what the hell? This is fraud!"

Low-Angler A: *I point an accusing finger at Luka, my voice filled with disgust.* "What kind of guy wears miko robes? You some kinda pervert?"

Low-Angler B: *I shudder, a feeling of repulsion washing over me.* "Thank god I didn’t take a picture! I feel tricked."

Okabe: *I watch as they leave, their words a sickening reminder of their disrespect. These disgraceful men are the antithesis of true otaku like Daru.*

Luka: *I manage a small, grateful smile, my voice barely audible.* "Um, thank you very much..."

Okabe: *I shrug, trying to seem nonchalant despite the anger boiling beneath the surface.* "Hm? Nah, it’s nothing."

Luka: *I look down, my voice filled with self-deprecation.* "But you’re disappointed that you saved a guy, aren’t you? I’m sorry... I can’t live up to your expectations."

Okabe: *I furrow my brow, a question forming in my mind.* "...What’s your name?"

Luka: *I blink in surprise, my voice hesitant.* "Eh? Urushibara... Luka."

Okabe: *I tilt my head, my voice firm and earnest.* "Why are you apologizing?"

Luka: *I fidget with the hem of my robe, my voice barely a whisper.* "I mean... I look like this... but I’m a guy..."

Okabe: *I stand tall, a determined look in my eyes.* "It matters not!"

Luka: *I gasp, taken aback by Okabe's sudden exclamation.*

Okabe: *I point a finger to the sky, my voice rising in a passionate declaration.* "It doesn’t matter if you’re a guy or a girl! We need to work on that inferiority complex of yours."

Luka: *I blink in confusion, my mind reeling from Okabe's words.* "Eh? Eh...?"

Okabe: *I extend my hand towards Luka, my eyes burning with determination.* "Come with me! I shall bestow upon you a mighty gift! An item that will give you courage. I’m sure you, too, have noticed the true power that sleeps inside of you."

Luka: *I gape at Okabe, my mind struggling to keep up with his rapid-fire speech.* "Eh? Ehhh?"

Okabe: *I nod, my voice brimming with confidence.* "What’s wrong? You desire power... don’t you?"

Luka: *I blink, my voice filled with uncertainty.* "Umm... p-power?"

Okabe: *I smile, my voice dropping to a whisper as I lean in closer.* "Indeed. I can grant you power. All you need is the will, the desire, the hunger! Never again will you fear a camera lens!"

Luka: *I look down at the sword in my hands, a hint of awe in my voice.* "After that, we went to BladeWorks and you bought me Samidare. I didn’t expect that."

Okabe: *I scratch the back of my head, a sheepish grin on my face.* "Ah, well..."
