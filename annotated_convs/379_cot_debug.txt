Planning:

- Characters involved:
    - Luka: Shy, feminine, traditionally Japanese. She's in love with Okabe.
    - Okabe: Protagonist, semi-delusional "mad scientist", conflicted with his feelings for Luka.
    - Mayuri: Cheerful, airheaded, Okabe's childhood friend. 
    - Itaru: Okabe's otaku friend, sarcastic, computer geek.

- Stylistic choices:
    - For Luka, I'll focus on subtle gestures that showcase her shy nature and romantic feelings.
    - Okabe will show internal conflict with his thoughts and actions. His confusion and shock will be a big part of his character in this scene.
    - Mayuri's cheerfulness will be conveyed through her dialogue and energetic actions.
    - Itaru's snarky comments and demeanor will be reflected in his actions.

- Anchoring lines:
    - Luka: "Ever since you said those words... I’ve liked you." – This is a big reveal, and will be a pivotal moment.
    - Okabe: "Of course it is. Yes. Of course." – This line will show Okabe's internal struggle and his attempt to accept Luka's feelings.

Roleplay:

Luka: *My cheeks flush a vibrant shade of pink, a warmth spreading across my face. I'm unable to meet Okabe's gaze, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Ever since you said those words... I’ve liked you."

Okabe: *Shock and disbelief surge through me. The words echo in my head, a cacophony of confusion.* Wait a second... Wait a second. Wait a goddamn second! Is she saying what I think she’s saying? But that Lukako was a guy! Does that mean I made the guy Lukako fall in love with me? *My thoughts are a whirlwind, and by the time I escort her back to the shrine, exhaustion weighs me down, both physically and mentally.*

Luka: *I look up at Okabe, a small smile on my lips, my voice barely a whisper.* "Today... was really fun."

Okabe: *I blink, surprised and confused.* "R-really?" *A pang of guilt gnaws at me, as I realize her smile doesn't reach her eyes. I couldn't stop thinking about the time Lukako fell in love with me, so I barely made conversation at all.*

Luka: *I fidget, biting my lower lip.* "So... um..."

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest, anticipation and anxiety wrestling for dominance.* "Wh-what is it?"

Luka: *I gather my courage, my voice barely audible.* "Well... tomorrow..."

Okabe: *My mind races to fill in the blanks, the implications of her words dawning on me.* "Ah... eh?" 

Luka: *I take a deep breath, my voice barely above a whisper.* "I want to be with Okabe-san again... tomorrow."

Okabe: *I force a smile, my heart heavy with mixed emotions.* "T-thanks..."

Luka: *I look at him, my eyes pleading.* "Is that... okay?"

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my voice shaky but firm.* "Of course it is. Yes. Of course."

Luka: *A sigh of relief escapes my lips, and a genuine smile finally reaches my eyes.* "Thank goodness..."

Okabe: *I watch her leave, a mixture of confusion, guilt, and something unidentifiable welling up within me.* Another date tomorrow... Tomorrow...

Mayuri: *I greet Okabe with a cheery wave, my eyes sparkling with delight.* "Tutturu♪ Welcome backarin."

Itaru: *I shoot Okabe a glowering look, my voice dripping with sarcasm.* "Die, you filthy normal."

Okabe: *I enter the lab, greeted by Mayuri's infectious cheer and Daru's resentful snark. I'm too emotionally drained to react.*

Itaru: *I scoff, my tone bitter.* "Since when does a chuunibyou patient like you rate a girlfriend? It’s not right, man."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a curious gleam in my eyes.* "How’d your date with Luka-chan go?"

Okabe: *I shrug noncommittally, my mind still a whirlwind of thoughts.* "Well... Stage Clear, somehow. Probably." 

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, an idea sparking in my eyes.* "ComiMa’s the day after tomorrow, you know? What if you and Luka-chan go as a cosplay couple? Maybe you can persuade her to go, now that you’re her boyfriend. She never says yes to me. And I’ve asked her so many times, too. But if Okarin asks her, then I’m sure she’ll say OK!"

Okabe: *I shake my head, my voice firm.* "I refuse."

Mayuri: *I pout, genuinely puzzled.* "Eh? Why?"
