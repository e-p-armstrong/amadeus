Itaru: *I jump up from my chair, spilling chips over my keyboard.* "Geh!? Okarin, you idiot, those words are an insult to virgins the world over! Apologize! Apologize to the virgins!"

Okabe: *I chuckle, leaning back in my chair.* "Just think about it. All you do is walk, eat, and go home. And the whole time, you have to worry about what your partner is thinking. What’s fun about that?"

Mayuri: *I shake my head, looking at Okabe with a stern expression.* "Don’t say that, Okarin. You’ll make Luka-chan sad." *I suddenly become serious, my usual cheerful demeanor replaced with a solemnity that's rare for me.*

Mayuri: "You know... just being with the person she likes is enough to make a girl happy. That’s all she really needs. Doesn’t being together make boys happy too? If not... that makes Mayuri sad." *I wonder why Okabe would say such things. It makes me feel a little sad thinking about it.*

Itaru: *I laugh heartily, slapping my knee.* "Okarin’s the minority. I mean, dates are a great opportunity for H-scenes."

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, shaking my head in disbelief.* "You’re an idiot."

Itaru: *I lean forward, a gleam in my eyes as I explain my theory.* "Come on! Holding hands and stuff’s pretty H, isn’t it? And when you’re arm-in-arm and her boob hits your elbow, that’s like super mega H! And then at the end of the date, you kiss, right!? Damn you! Death to normals!"

Okabe: *I sigh, rubbing my temples.* "You play too much eroge."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, curiously looking between Okabe and Luka.* "Hey, hey. When did Luka-chan fall for Okarin?"

Okabe: *I pause, trying to remember.* "When? Well..."

Luka: *I blush, fidgeting with the hem of my dress.* "I was really surprised when you said it didn’t matter... but at the same time... it really made me happy. Ever since you said those words... I’ve liked you."

Okabe: *I furrow my brows, deep in thought.* "Something still feels off about her story. I said that Luka’s gender didn’t matter. I remember that clearly. But didn’t I say that because Lukako was a guy?" *I feel a sense of confusion. Something doesn't add up.* "...Right. That doesn’t make sense."

Okabe: *I suddenly realize what's bothering me.* "Now I know what feels out of place. I wouldn’t have said that to a female Lukako. So why does this Lukako remember what I said back then? I recall what happened with Faris."

Faris: *I twirl a strand of my hair around my finger, a playful smile on my face.* "...I remember, nya! The wish Faris made... ...Was to save Papa, who died ten years ago, nya."

Okabe: *A thought crosses my mind.* "Faris regained her memories from before she sent the D-Mail. Could Lukako, too, have remembered the previous worldline, where she was a guy? That would explain everything. However... She remembers that event, and she said she liked me for it, so... Did Lukako like me even when she was a guy? I think I need to check this out."

Okabe: *The next morning, I head to the shrine to meet with Lukako. She’s already waiting in the courtyard. When she sees me, she smiles and waves her hand. Too cute... must... resist...*

Luka: *I greet him with a shy smile.* "Good morning."

Okabe: *I stammer, caught off guard by her cuteness.* "M-morning."

Luka: *I tilt my head, my eyes full of anticipation.* "Um... where are we going today?"

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, preparing myself.* "Before that..."

Luka: *I blink in surprise.* "Yes?"

Okabe: *I make up my mind and throw out the question.* "Do you have any memories of when you were a guy?"

Luka: *I twitch for a moment. And then I hang my head.* "N-no, I don’t..."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, scrutinizing her reaction.* "Really?"
