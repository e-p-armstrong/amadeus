Okabe: *I glance at my wristwatch, frustration bubbling within me.* Damn. That means he won’t join up with us for at least another hour. Couldn’t he forgo the battle just this once? *I sigh, turning my gaze to Lukako who seems out of place amidst the frenzied crowd.* Lukako’s eyes dart from place to place. She’s clearly uncomfortable in the chaotic atmosphere. *I feel a pang of guilt remembering the awkward silence between us during yesterday's incident.* Even on the train ride, we barely spoke to each other. *I scratch my head in confusion.* What’s the point in being a couple if it turns out like this? *I think back to the times when we were just friends.* It was easier to talk when we weren’t supposed to be boyfriend and girlfriend. Lukako seemed to enjoy herself more too. *I look around at the bustling event, second-guessing my decision.* Was it a mistake to bring her to ComiMa? *I look at Lukako, her face unreadable.* Well, Lukako didn’t refuse. Even when I told her we were going to ComiMa, she just nodded obediently.

Mayuri: *I turn to Lukako, beaming with excitement.* "Mayushii will show you around, okay? Um, there’s lots of people, so we’ve gotta be careful. First we’ll go to the cosplay area! And then we’ll go inside!" *I look around, my eyes sparkling with anticipation.*

Okabe: *I watch Mayuri, a small smile tugging at my lips.* Mayuri’s more cheerful than usual. She must be happy to have us here.

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, asking enthusiastically,* "Hey, is there anything you guys wanna see?"

Okabe: *I turn to Lukako, my brows furrowing slightly.* "...Lukako, is there anything you want to see?"

Luka: *I shake my head, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Ah, no..." 

Okabe: *I watch Lukako shake her head, her soft rejection stinging more than I care to admit.* It’s my first time, so... if Okabe-san wants to see something, I’ll go see it...

Okabe: *I lean back, crossing my arms over my chest, trying to hide my disappointment.* "I’m not particularly interested in anything."

Okabe: *I glance at Lukako, her face clouding with disappointment.* Lukako looks unhappy. *I curse myself inwardly.* Crap, I shouldn’t have answered like that.

Mayuri: *I look at Luka, my eyes sparkling with excitement.* "Hey, Luka-chan. If you come to the cosplay area, I’m sure you’ll change your mind about cosplaying!"

Okabe: *I watch as Mayuri talks happily to Lukako.* I’m glad I chose to rely on this ditz who can’t read the mood.

Mayuri: *I continue to babble on, completely oblivious to the tension between Okabe and Lukako.* "It’s not embarrassing at all, see? ’Cause everyone’s having fun! Kaede-chan and Fubuki-chan are there wearing Mayushii’s costumes! I’ll introduce you, okay? You should come tomorrow too! I’ll bring costumes for you and we can cosplay together! I think Okarin would be perfect as Zerosum from Code Jeass. You’ll cosplay if Okarin does it with you, right, Luka-chan? You will, won’t you? Mayushii thinks it’s a great idea!"

Okabe: *I hold up a hand, cutting her off.* "Not a chance."

Luka: *I lower my head, my voice barely audible.* "S-sorry..."

Mayuri: *I blink, my smile faltering slightly.* "Eh? No way..."
