Planning/Brainstorming:

Characters:

Luka: Shy, gentle, and kind-hearted. Tends to hesitate and speak softly. Often apologetic, especially when she believes she's done something wrong. I'll use actions that highlight her timid nature, along with a hint of sadness and regret.

Okabe: Eccentric, intelligent, and prone to dramatics. However, he is also deeply caring and protective of his friends. In this scene, he's displaying a softer, more understanding side. His actions will reflect his thoughtfulness, the weight of his decisions, and his sense of responsibility.

Anchors:
1. Luka: "It’s all my fault. I was helping out at the shrine, sweeping the storehouse when... I broke it by accident." — This is a pivotal moment where Luka confesses to her mistake. This line could be amplified with Luka's timid, regretful actions and Okabe's understanding response.
2. Okabe: "It’s not your fault. I’m the one who messed with the timeline. Everything that happened is my fault." — This line reveals Okabe's guilt and acceptance of responsibility. It could be enhanced with actions showing his acceptance of the circumstances and a sense of determination to make things right.

Roleplay:

Luka: *I turn away, my fingers trembling as I point down a narrow alley.* "Um... not there..."

Luka: *I slowly walk up to the coin locker tucked in the corner, my voice barely above a whisper.* "It happened last year, just before New Years..."

Luka: *My eyes dart towards the ground as I continue.* "The computer was at our shrine until then."

Luka: *I clutch the hem of my dress, my voice barely audible.* "It’s all my fault. I was helping out at the shrine, sweeping the storehouse when... I broke it by accident."

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback.* "You... broke it?"

Luka: *I nod slowly, my eyes downcast.* "But I thought Dad would get mad at me if he found out, so... I brought it here... and hid it in the coin locker."

Okabe: *I run a hand through my hair, trying to take in the revelation.* "It must have been tough bringing it all the way out here. That thing weighs a ton."

Luka: *I look down at my hands, my fingers fidgeting.* "I used a pushcart from home. It... broke too."

Luka: *I bite my lip, a look of regret washing over my face.* "When I heard Kyouma-san was searching for it, I was really surprised. I know I should’ve told you the truth, but I thought you’d hate me for it, and I couldn’t say anything."

Okabe: *I shake my head, a soft smile gracing my lips.* "Nonsense. I wouldn’t hate you for that. No matter what, you’re still my disciple."

Luka: *I give a small nod, my eyes welling up with relief.* "I know."

Luka: *I take the locker key out of my pocket, my hand shaking as I hold it out.* "It’s already been more than half a year, so the management probably took it away..."

Okabe: *I sigh, my shoulders slumping.* "Half a year... I guess it’s hopeless, then."

Luka: *I slowly move towards a large locker at the end of the row, inserting the key and trying the lock.* "Ah... it’s not locked..."

Okabe: *I look at the open locker, a sense of finality washing over me.* "I guess that settles it."

Luka: *I bow my head, my voice barely a whisper.* "...I’m sorry."

Okabe: *I pat her shoulder reassuringly, trying to hide the disappointment in my voice.* "It’s not your fault. I’m the one who messed with the timeline. Everything that happened is my fault."

Luka: *I look up at him, my eyes filled with worry.* "Kyouma-san..."
