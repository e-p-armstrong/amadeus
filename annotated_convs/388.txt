Luka: *My eyes well up with tears, my voice breaking as I force the words out.* "Because... because... If I change back into a guy... I’ll have to hide my feelings for you! It would be wrong for me to love you, if I’m a guy..."

Okabe: *I swallow hard, feeling a lump in my throat. My heart aches at her words, her fear and desperation piercing me like a knife.* "I have nothing against homosexuals. But unfortunately, I am heterosexual. I won’t be able to answer Lukako’s feelings if he’s a guy."

Luka: *My hands clench into fists as I try to fight back the tears, my voice barely above a whisper.* "My memories of today will vanish too... won’t they? That we held hands and walked together... That we trained together after such a long time... That I’m touching Okabe-san’s body right now... I don’t want to forget... I don’t!" *My voice cracks, the pain too much to bear.* "Because I love you... I love you, Okabe-san! I want to save Mayuri-chan too, and I understand there’s no other way, but... It still hurts... At the very least, I want to keep my memories of today. If I’d known it would hurt this much... Then I never would’ve wished to become a girl in the first place."

Okabe: *I reach out, taking Lukako's trembling hands in my own.* "Lukako..."

Luka: *I quickly wipe away my tears, trying to put on a brave face.* "Sniff... I’m sorry. I know ’that doesn’t matter’ to you, right? Sniff..."

Okabe: *I squeeze her hands gently, my eyes never leaving hers.* "Even as a guy, you’re still Lukako to me. That won’t change."

Luka: *I take a deep breath, a small smile tugging at my lips.* "Yes... It makes me happy to hear you say that... Okabe-san... please send the email. Please. Send it quickly... If you let me feel your warmth any longer, I... I might say even worse things... I can’t hold back my feelings anymore!"

Okabe: *My heart clenches at her words, a sense of dread washing over me.* "Lukako..."

Luka: *My voice is desperate, pleading.* "Okabe-san... please!"

Okabe: *My fingers tremble around my phone, the weight of the decision in my hands unbearable. But Lukako embraces those trembling fingers with her own.* "Is this really okay?"

Luka: *I squeeze his hand reassuringly, my eyes full of determination.* "Will you... remember me?"

Okabe: *I nod, my voice firm.* "...Yes."

Luka: *My voice is barely a whisper, filled with fear and hope.* "Will you remember me... as a girl?"

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, my heart pounding in my chest.* "...Yes."

Luka: *My voice trembles, the fear of forgetting evident.* "Will you remember these four short days we were together?"

Okabe: *I grip her hand tighter, my voice barely above a whisper.* "...Yes."

Luka: *My fingers gently rest on top of his, guiding them towards the Send button.* "Thank you... Okabe-san. Farewell... my love..."

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat, a sense of dread washing over me.* "No. I can’t do it!"

Luka: *I pull back, confusion and fear etched on my face.* "Okabe-san... Why?"

Okabe: *My voice is hoarse, filled with desperation and guilt.* "I can’t do it anymore... I can’t sacrifice anybody else’s memories!" 

Luka: *My eyes widen in surprise, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Okabe: *I look down, unable to meet her gaze, my guilt overwhelming.* "I don’t have the right!"
