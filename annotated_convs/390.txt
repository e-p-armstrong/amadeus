Okabe: *I turn to Lukako, my eyes serious and pleading.* "Could you fetch your father for me, Lukako? I need to ask him something about the storehouse."

Luka’s Father: *He nods at me, his eyes squinting slightly in recollection.* "An old computer... yes, I do remember. I’ll go check. Please wait a moment." *With that, he turns and disappears into the storeroom out back, leaving us in the quiet store.*

Okabe: *While he's gone, I stand there, lost in thought. My mind is filled with images of the previous worldline, where the IBN 5100 was missing from the storehouse. I anxiously bite my lower lip, wondering if history is repeating itself. After what feels like an eternity, Luka’s dad returns. His face is etched with worry and defeat. My heart sinks. I know what he's about to say.*

Luka’s Father: *He sighs heavily, his shoulders slumping.* "It’s gone. I couldn’t find it anywhere."

Okabe: *I quickly glance at Lukako’s face, hoping to find some answers. But all I see is confusion. He doesn’t seem to know anything. I let out a sigh of relief, convinced of Lukako's innocence.*

Luka’s Father: "The lock to the storehouse was broken. Someone may have stolen it." *His voice is filled with concern, and he rubs his temples in stress.*

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, my heart skipping a beat.* "Stolen it?" *Could it really have been stolen? The possibility sends a chill down my spine.*

Luka’s Father: "There’s evidence someone dragged something heavy away. That wasn’t there at the end-of-the-year cleaning, and the lock wasn’t broken when I checked last month. I never expected a thief would break in." *His voice is filled with disbelief and regret.*

Luka: *His voice trembles slightly as he suggests,* "Then shouldn’t we report it to the police?"

Okabe: *While they discuss the next steps, I rub my temples, feeling a headache coming on. The situation is more complicated than I had anticipated.* "This isn’t going to work." *I mutter to myself, feeling a wave of disappointment wash over me.*

Okabe: *I start pacing, my mind racing with possibilities. The IBN 5100 is still out of my grasp. There are two D-Mails left to cancel. I can feel it in my gut. If I cancel just one more, the IBN 5100 will be within my reach. But which one should I choose?*

Luka: *He looks at me with concern in his eyes, his voice barely a whisper.* "Um, Okabe-san. I don’t really understand, but please don’t be sad. J-just go ’It matters not!’ like you always do."

Okabe: *I chuckle softly, feeling a small smile tug at the corners of my mouth. Lukako’s words, although slightly misplaced, have a comforting effect.* "You’re using that phrase wrong, you know."
