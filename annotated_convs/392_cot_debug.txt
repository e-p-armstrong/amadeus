Planning: 

The scene is a serious and intense one, taking place between Okabe and Kurisu. Okabe is the protagonist and the character that the player controls. He's eccentric, paranoid, and often puts on a mad scientist persona, but beneath that, he's a truly caring person who goes to great lengths to protect those he cares about. 

Kurisu, on the other hand, is a genius neuroscientist who is initially skeptical and cold but reveals a warmer, more caring side as the story progresses. She's smart, quick-witted, and often the voice of reason against Okabe's eccentricities.

Given their personalities, I'll be using a lot of *actions* that show Okabe's inner turmoil and desperation. For Kurisu, I'll portray her as serious and concerned, her scientific mind grappling with the impossibility of their situation.

The anchors of the scene will be Okabe's revelation about his time leaps and his request for Kurisu to witness Mayuri's death. They carry a lot of emotional weight and dramatically shift the direction of the conversation.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I glance back at Mayuri, waiting patiently in the lab, before leading Kurisu outside.* "So, Christina."

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, an annoyed frown on my face.* "I’m not going to ComiMa."

Okabe: "You said ’again’ just now. We’ve talked like this before, just the two of us?" *I ask, my gaze fixed intently on her.*

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow at him, my tone teasing but not unkind.* "Losing your memory now? Does our little mad scientist have an acetylcholine deficiency?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, my voice taking on a serious tone.* "I’m being serious."

Kurisu: *I narrow my eyes, studying him closely.* "You’re acting weird today. What’s going on?"

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my hands balling into fists at my sides.* "Please. I need to know."

Kurisu: "I mean, yeah. This is like the fifth time you’ve brought me outside to talk about the Time Leap Machine." *I admit, confusion evident in my voice.*

Okabe: "Have we talked about my time leaping?" *I ask, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Kurisu: *Surprise flickers in my eyes before I quickly hide it, replacing it with a glare.* "You’re time leaping?"

Okabe: *I nod, struggling to keep my voice steady.* "More than a dozen times already."

Kurisu: *My eyes widen in shock, my voice rising in disbelief.* "That many!? What the hell are you doing!?"

Okabe: *I let out a heavy sigh, running a hand through my hair.* "I guess I have to explain everything again."

Kurisu: *After he finishes, I lightly pat his arm, my voice full of concern.* "...I think I get it. Don’t wear yourself out."

Okabe: *I pull away, a bitter laugh escaping my lips.* "It’s a disgrace to be comforted by my assistant."

Kurisu: *I throw my hands up in frustration, my voice rising in anger.* "Why are you always like that!? I’m even trying to be nice. You’re really full of yourself, you know?"

Okabe: *I turn away from her, my voice barely above a whisper.* "I don’t need your sympathy. Everything that happened is my fault. I’m just getting what I deserve. ...Come to think of it, every time I explain this to you, I always end up hating myself in the end."

Kurisu: *I reach out to him, my voice softening.* "Okabe..."

Okabe: *I cut her off, my voice firm.* "Don’t worry about me. Worry about Mayuri. Mayuri will probably die tomorrow. I don’t know how it will happen."

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, trying to steady myself.* "Sorry about this, but I want you to be there when she dies tomorrow night."

Kurisu: *I blink at him, my voice barely a whisper.* "That’s why you want me to go to ComiMa?"

Okabe: *I nod, my gaze distant.* "There’s nothing we can do to prevent her death. Just stay close and tell me when it happens. Once I know, I’ll make the time leap."

Kurisu: *I take a step back, my voice shaking slightly.* "I can’t believe there’s nothing we can do. It just doesn’t feel real. But it’s the truth, isn’t it? I can see it in your eyes. ...Are you okay?"
