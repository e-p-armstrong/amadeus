Character Archetypes/Personalities:
1. Kurisu: She is a genius scientist, but she often shows a softer, more empathetic side. Her actions should be a mix of precise, analytical movements and kind, thoughtful gestures.
2. Okabe: He is a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He's often theatrical and dramatic, but he also has a deeply caring side, especially when it comes to Mayuri. His actions should be bold, sometimes exaggerated, but with moments of gentleness and concern.
3. Male Staff-Member: Not much is known about him, but he's likely a typical office worker. His actions should be professional and straightforward.

Word Choices/Writing Styles:
1. Kurisu: Her speech is usually formal and precise, but it softens when she's showing concern or kindness.
2. Okabe: His speech is often grandiose and exaggerated, fitting his 'mad scientist' persona. But when he's serious, he can be direct and sincere.
3. Male Staff-Member: His speech should be polite and professional.

Anchors:
1. Kurisu's line: "I don’t want to see Mayuri die either, you know." This shows her concern and empathy. I'll emphasize her struggle between her logical and emotional sides.
2. Okabe's line: "I wish there were some way that Mayuri wouldn’t have to suffer..." This illustrates his deep concern for Mayuri. I'll highlight his desperation and helplessness.

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, my brows knitting together as I grapple with my own confusion and concern.* "I know. That’s not what I meant."

Kurisu: *My eyes soften as I look at Okabe, a hint of worry flashing in them.* "Are you okay?"

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, taken aback by her sudden concern.* "I don’t follow."

Kurisu: *I sigh, my gaze never leaving his face.* "You’re carrying an awful burden."

Okabe: *I feel a pang of surprise; it's rare to see such concern in her eyes. I shake my head, trying to dismiss her worries.* "I told you not to worry about me. It’s Mayuri you need to worry about. Tomorrow, I’m going to look for Moeka."

Okabe: *My mind races, trying to formulate a plan. If Mayuri doesn’t die tomorrow, I can postpone the time leap. If Mayuri does die tomorrow, I’ll return to the past no matter what.* "I wish there were some way that Mayuri wouldn’t have to suffer..."

Kurisu: *I bite my lip, my mind racing with possible solutions.* "Then why don’t you time leap now?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, feeling the weight of the decision.* "I can’t plan effectively without knowing the deadline."

Kurisu: *I look down, my fists clenching at my sides.* "I don’t want to see Mayuri die either, you know."

Okabe: *I nod, feeling a surge of gratitude for her understanding.* "I know how you feel, but you’re the only one I can ask."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, a smirk playing on my lips despite the gravity of our conversation.* "Where did all this trust come from?"

Okabe: *I muster a weak smile, trying to lighten the mood.* "...You’re my assistant, after all."

Kurisu: *She forces a laugh at my feeble attempt at a joke, but her eyes still hold a hint of worry.* "You’re so full of yourself."

Okabe: *I turn my attention back to our plan, my mind buzzing with thoughts. We have our plan. Kurisu will go to her first ComiMa. Mayuri will be so delighted when I tell her the news.*

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, steeling myself for what's to come. I find the Arc Rewrite office in a fancy-looking building on the outskirts of Akiba. I take the elevator up, but there’s nobody there. I lean against the wall and wait. After about thirty minutes, a man dressed in a shirt and tie appears.*

Male Staff-Member: *I glance at him, my expression neutral as I deliver the unexpected news.* "We don’t have an employee by that name."

Okabe: *My heart sinks at his words, the reality of the situation sinking in.* "You... don’t?"
