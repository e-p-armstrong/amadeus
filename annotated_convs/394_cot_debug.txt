Planning Stage:

Character archetypes/personalities:

- Okabe: A self-proclaimed mad scientist, Okabe is generally over-dramatic and eccentric. However, he is also deeply caring and intelligent. He is currently dealing with a lot of stress and frustration, so his actions and thoughts will reflect this.

- Moeka: A silent and seemingly emotionless woman, Moeka is actually very dependent and fearful. She is currently in a state of panic, so her actions will be characterized by desperation and helplessness.

- Kurisu: A genius scientist, Kurisu is a rational and level-headed person who can also be a bit tsundere. She is currently confused and a bit annoyed, so her actions will reflect this.

Writing styles:

- Okabe's actions and thoughts will be characterized by frustration and determination, with a bit of fear and anger. His language will be straightforward and a bit harsh, reflecting his current emotional state.

- Moeka's actions will be characterized by desperation and helplessness. Her language will be minimal and fragmented, reflecting her current emotional state.

- Kurisu's actions will be characterized by confusion and annoyance. Her language will be rational and a bit sarcastic, reflecting her personality.

Anchor lines:

- Okabe: "Dammit." I will enhance this line to convey Okabe's frustration and despair, showing the weight of the situation and his determination to save Mayuri.

- Kurisu: "So you are with a woman. You’re the worst." I will enhance this line to show Kurisu's annoyance and confusion, and to add a bit of humor to lighten the scene.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I make several desperate attempts to snatch her phone from her grasp, my fingers barely grazing the cold metal each time. But she's quick, too quick, batting my hand away with a strength that belies her frail appearance. I grit my teeth, frustration bubbling up inside me.* "...uugh..." *I hear her let out a soft groan, her eyes still glued to the screen of her phone. Her refusal to cooperate is getting under my skin. I decide to try a different approach.* "If you lend me your phone, I promise to help you search for FB." *I say, my voice laced with a lie. Her response, however, is nothing more than silence.*

Moeka: *I continue to stare at my phone, my fingers trembling as I type another message, another plea for FB to respond. The silence is deafening, the lack of response driving me deeper into despair.* "Why won’t you respond, FB? You’re the one who recruited me..."

Okabe: *I watch her, my heart hardening against the sight of her tears. Why should I feel pity for her? It's Mayuri who deserves sympathy, not her. I swallow back the bitter words threatening to spill from my lips, and instead let out a frustrated sigh.* "...Dammit."

Okabe: *I check my phone, noticing Kurisu's name flashing on the screen. I move to the entrance, making sure to keep Moeka within my sight as I answer.* "Hello?"

Kurisu: *I let out a sigh of relief as I hear Okabe's voice.* "Finally. Where are you?"

Okabe: *I glance back at Moeka, her figure hunched over her phone.* "...Sorry, I’m busy."

Kurisu: "Is it a woman? You’re with a woman, aren’t you?"

Okabe: *I can't help but let out a dry chuckle at Kurisu's accusation.* "Is that the first thing that comes to mind? You really are a mainstream girl."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes at his response, my annoyance growing.* "Shut up. You promised you’d help with the PhoneWave, remember? Or is your lab mem number just for show?"

Okabe: *I feel a pang of guilt at her words, but I push it aside.* "Get Daru to help. I can’t do it today."

Kurisu: *My confusion turns into suspicion as I ask,* "...What are you doing? Where are you?"

Okabe: *I hesitate for a moment before answering.* "Kiryu Moeka’s apartment."

Kurisu: *I let out a scoff, my annoyance reaching its peak.* "So you are with a woman. You’re the worst."
