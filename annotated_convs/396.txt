Okabe: *My grip tightens around Moeka's neck, her face contorting in pain. I can feel her weakening, her futile attempts to escape growing feebler. I push harder, ignoring the sting of guilt and the sickening sensation of power. Her phone is in my hand now, wrestled from her feeble grip.* 

Moeka: "Gehh, gehhehuggehgehoh--"

Okabe: *I quickly let go of her, stepping back and putting distance between us. She doubles over, coughing violently, her hand outstretched towards me. Her phone. She wants her phone back. I ignore her, my focus on the screen, on the string of FBs. I erase them, my fingers stumbling over the unfamiliar device.*

Moeka: "Gehohgehoh, bi...na..."

Okabe: *My head snaps up at her voice, finding her staggering to her feet. She's like a zombie, refusing to stay down. I bolt, slamming the door behind me and pressing my body against it. She's trying to open it, her feeble attempts shaking the doorknob. I ignore it, focusing on the phone in my hand. I just need to send the D-Mail, to undo what she did. To save Mayuri. I can feel the victory within my grasp.* "Fate won’t have Mayuri this time! Victory will be mine!"

Kurisu: "This is Makise."

Okabe: "Get ready for a D-Mail!"

Kurisu: "Okay, but what’s that noise!?"

Okabe: "I’m having a little trouble here."

Kurisu: *I let out a breath I didn't realize I was holding.* "So you didn’t kill her. Good job!" 

Okabe: *I quickly relay Moeka's address to her, my back still pressed against the door.*

Kurisu: "It’s ready."

Okabe: "And Mayuri?"

Kurisu: "Still here. She’s at the Braun Tube Workshop trying to get the manager to turn on the CRT."

Okabe: "You didn’t tell her anything, did you?"

Kurisu: "About her death? Of course not."

Okabe: "Good. Don’t hang up yet."
