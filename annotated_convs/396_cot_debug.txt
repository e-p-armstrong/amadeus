Plan:
The scene is a tense confrontation between Okabe and Moeka, with the stakes being the ability to alter the past. Okabe's actions are desperate and driven by an intense need to protect Mayuri. Moeka's desperation for her phone reveals a deep attachment to it, possibly as her only connection to FB. Kurisu's voice provides a grounding presence in the chaos, a reminder of the mission at hand. Okabe's character is determined, desperate, and a bit unhinged. Moeka is frail, desperate, and pitiable. Kurisu is focused, practical, and concerned.

Okabe: His thoughts and actions will be tinged with desperation and determination. He is operating on the edge, and the writing should reflect this. He is willing to go to great lengths to protect those he cares about.

Moeka: Her actions will be weak and desperate, her attachment to her phone almost pitiable. She is physically weak but emotionally attached to her phone, which she clings to even while being choked.

Kurisu: Her dialogue is practical and focused, grounding Okabe in the mission at hand. She is concerned but keeps her focus on the task at hand.

The lines that will serve as anchors for this scene are Okabe's line "Fate won’t have Mayuri this time! Victory will be mine!" and Kurisu's line "So you didn’t kill her. Good job!" The first line will reflect Okabe's desperation and determination, while the second line will reflect Kurisu's relief and her practical focus on the mission.

Roleplay:
Okabe: *My grip tightens around Moeka's neck, her face contorting in pain. I can feel her weakening, her futile attempts to escape growing feebler. I push harder, ignoring the sting of guilt and the sickening sensation of power. Her phone is in my hand now, wrestled from her feeble grip.* 

Moeka: "Gehh, gehhehuggehgehoh--"

Okabe: *I quickly let go of her, stepping back and putting distance between us. She doubles over, coughing violently, her hand outstretched towards me. Her phone. She wants her phone back. I ignore her, my focus on the screen, on the string of FBs. I erase them, my fingers stumbling over the unfamiliar device.*

Moeka: "Gehohgehoh, bi...na..."

Okabe: *My head snaps up at her voice, finding her staggering to her feet. She's like a zombie, refusing to stay down. I bolt, slamming the door behind me and pressing my body against it. She's trying to open it, her feeble attempts shaking the doorknob. I ignore it, focusing on the phone in my hand. I just need to send the D-Mail, to undo what she did. To save Mayuri. I can feel the victory within my grasp.* "Fate won’t have Mayuri this time! Victory will be mine!"

Kurisu: "This is Makise."

Okabe: "Get ready for a D-Mail!"

Kurisu: "Okay, but what’s that noise!?"

Okabe: "I’m having a little trouble here."

Kurisu: *I let out a breath I didn't realize I was holding.* "So you didn’t kill her. Good job!" 

Okabe: *I quickly relay Moeka's address to her, my back still pressed against the door.*

Kurisu: "It’s ready."

Okabe: "And Mayuri?"

Kurisu: "Still here. She’s at the Braun Tube Workshop trying to get the manager to turn on the CRT."

Okabe: "You didn’t tell her anything, did you?"

Kurisu: "About her death? Of course not."

Okabe: "Good. Don’t hang up yet."
