Planning Stage:

Characters Involved:
1. Okabe: He is a self-proclaimed mad scientist with a dramatic and flamboyant personality. However, in this tense situation, his worry and desperation might shine through, toning down his usual theatrics. His thoughts would be analytical and frantic, trying to figure out the problem at hand.
2. Kurisu: She is a rational and intelligent scientist. She is generally calm and composed, but can show concern for others. Her actions would be precise and her thoughts would be logical.

Word Choices/Writing Styles:
Okabe's thoughts would be detailed and analytical, his actions desperate yet determined. His dialogue would contain his usual dramatic flair but subdued due to the tense situation. Kurisu's actions would be calm and calculated, and her thoughts would be rational and logical. Her dialogue would be straightforward and matter-of-fact.

Anchor Lines:
1. Okabe: "The worldline didn’t change!"
2. Okabe: "What a pain!"

Thematic Direction:
The thematic direction would lean towards the struggle of trying to change the worldline and the frustration when the efforts don't work. The anchor lines would emphasize the desperation and frustration of the characters, as they scramble to come up with a solution to their problem.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I feel a strange calm washing over me, no vertigo, no dizziness. Nothing. My ability, Reading Steiner, didn’t activate.* "What? Why?" *I question aloud, my voice echoing in the empty corridor.*

*I rack my brain for answers. Why didn’t the worldline change? Did the PhoneWave fail to function? The uncertainty gnaws at me. I bring my own phone back to my ear, the cold device offering no comfort. Kurisu is still on the line, her silence a stark contrast to the chaos in my mind.*

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest as I demand,* "Well!?"

Kurisu: *Her voice is calm, a steady rock amidst the storm.* "Did you send it?"

Okabe: *The impatience in my voice is palpable.* "Yes. Did it work!?"

Kurisu: "The discharge is occurring as normal."

Okabe: *Hope flares within me.* "So it worked, right?"

Kurisu: *With an air of certainty, she affirms,* "Definitely."

Okabe: *The calm gives way to confusion, the reality crashing down on me.* "The worldline didn’t change!"

Kurisu: *Her voice reflects her confusion.* "You mean it failed? Why?"

Okabe: *I scramble for answers, my mind racing.* "Maybe the message wasn’t enough to persuade Moeka to change models."

Kurisu: "Could we have sent it to the wrong date?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, even though she can't see me.* "It’s July 31st. I’m sure of it."

Kurisu: "Check when the original D-Mail arrived. Maybe her reaction will change if the new one arrives just after that."

Okabe: *I groan, the weight of the situation pressing down on me.* "What a pain!"

*The pounding on the door has ceased. Did she finally give up? No, she wouldn’t give up. Does she plan to climb out the window and loop around? But we’re on the second floor. That would be quite a feat. I should still have some time left.*

Kurisu: "Try sending different messages. If that doesn’t work, I’ll adjust the timer."

Okabe: *A small smile tugs at my lips at her determination.* "You’re a lifesaver. What’s going on there? Is Mister Braun freaking out?"

Kurisu: "I can hear him shouting from below. Hashida and Mayuri are trying to calm him down, but who knows how long that’ll last. I don’t think there’s much time left."

Okabe: *I put my phone into my pocket without hanging up. I change the message and send another D-Mail. ...But still, nothing happens. I make another one. Send. ...No good. Why? What am I doing wrong? I’d like to ask Moeka, but if I go back inside now, she’ll probably just attack me. Which reminds me, she’s been awfully quiet. What is she doing now? Maybe she really did go out the window. I look around. I don’t see her anywhere. Think. Why didn’t the D-Mail work? I wipe the sweat from my brow. My entire body is soaked. It must be the adrenaline. What if Moeka changed addresses when she got a new phone? I take out my phone.* "Are you there?"

Kurisu: "Still not working?"

Okabe: *I let out a sigh of defeat.* "I tried two more times, but nothing."

*I frantically consider my options as I stare hard at Moeka’s phone. The walkway is dim, but Moeka’s gaudy purple phone shines in the faint light. Wait. I take another good look at the phone. There’s something wrong here. What is it?*

Kurisu: "Okabe? What’s wrong?"

*Gaudy purple. Latest model. Removable LCD screen. Model number GG01. My eyes tell me there’s nothing wrong. I saw this phone when Moeka sent her D-Mail, and many times before. She was never without it. It’s the same. Nothing has changed.*

Okabe: *The realization hits me like a punch to the gut.* "Nothing... changed?"

Kurisu: *Her voice is filled with confusion.* "Huh? What hasn’t changed?"
