Planning:
- Okabe: Our protagonist, a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He's highly intelligent, eccentric, and has a flair for the dramatic. His actions will reflect his analytical mind, and his thoughts will be filled with speculations and deductions. 
- Moeka: A shy, introverted character with an obsessive attachment to her phone. Her actions will be quiet and subdued, reflecting her withdrawn personality.
- Kurisu: A tsundere character, she's a scientific genius who often tries to hide her concern for others behind a mask of indifference or irritation. Her actions will have a mix of frustration and reluctant concern.
- Anchors: Okabe's realization about the IBN 5100's location and his conversation with Kurisu about her worrying for him. These moments give us insight into Okabe's detective-like deduction and the complex relationship between Okabe and Kurisu.

Roleplay:
Okabe: *The gears in my mind turn rapidly, connecting dots and analyzing patterns.* "What was the designated location?" *I ask, my voice steady despite the turmoil in my mind.*

Moeka: *Her voice is a mere whisper, barely audible.* "The coin locker... in front of Daibiru..."

Okabe: *I'm lost in my thoughts, trying to piece together the puzzle.* The coin locker in front of Daibiru... it all comes together. The realization hits me like a thunderbolt. The lies, the deception, everything adds up. I was a pawn in her game. I can feel the bitter taste of regret in my mouth. *I suppress the urge to laugh at my own foolishness, maintaining a poker face.* 

Moeka: *Her sobs break the silence, soft and pitiful.* 

Okabe: *I sigh deeply, lifting myself off her. I lean against the wall, stretching my aching limbs.* "I’m using your phone." *I announce, pulling out Moeka's phone from my pocket.*

Okabe: *I watch as Moeka slowly rises. She wipes away her tears, fixes her hair and clothes. Her wavy hair acts as a curtain, hiding her face and her emotions from me. She doesn't protest or retaliate, just stands there, lost and defeated.*

Okabe: *I navigate through her phone, searching for the damning evidence. My fingers move with practiced ease, despite the tension thrumming through my veins. After what feels like an eternity, I find it. The D-Mail. The root of all this chaos.*

Okabe: *My phone rings, breaking the tense silence. I answer, hearing the familiar voice of my lab partner.* "You at the lab?" *I ask, my voice carrying a hint of relief.*

Kurisu: "Haah... don’t worry me like that... idiot..." *I can hear the relief mixed with frustration in her voice.*

Okabe: *A small smile tugs at my lips, despite the circumstances.* "What, were you worried about me?" *I tease, my tone light.*

Kurisu: *There's a pause, followed by a flustered denial.* "I-I mean, you set off an obvious death flag. I’m surprised you’re still alive!"

Okabe: *I can't help but chuckle at her reaction. Even in the face of danger, our banter remains the same. A slice of normalcy in this whirlwind of chaos. I turn my attention back to the task at hand, ready to set things right.*
