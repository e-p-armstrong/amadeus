Character Analysis and Planning:

1. Kurisu: She is a highly intelligent, logical, and serious individual who often takes on the role of the rational, level-headed voice of reason in the group. She has a direct, no-nonsense way of communicating, often getting straight to the point. Her actions should reflect this straightforwardness, her curiosity, and her dedication to scientific discovery.

2. Okabe: He's an eccentric, larger-than-life character who often puts on a facade of a mad scientist, but he's also deeply caring and fiercely protective of his friends. He's the one who usually takes the initiative in their experiments. His actions should reflect his passionate, impulsive, and sometimes desperate nature.

Anchor Lines:
1. Okabe: "No, there’s no way! I know what Moeka’s message said. This D-Mail should have canceled it." - This line captures Okabe's desperation and frustration, as he struggles to make sense of why their plan isn't working.
2. Kurisu: "The person who reads the D-Mail chooses whether or not to act accordingly. Kiryu learned that the IBN 5100 was at the shrine. Though the cancellation mail came right afterward, I guess she ignored it and went anyway." - This line is an important realization moment, where Kurisu points out a critical flaw in their plan.

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I glance around the lab, the hum of machinery creating a steady rhythm in the background.* "I’m standing by at the lab."

Okabe: *With a heavy sigh, I run a hand through my hair, trying to shake off the tension.* "Set up the machine. I’m sending another D-Mail."

Kurisu: *I arch an eyebrow, my gaze flicking to the machine.* "Destination?"

Okabe: *I pause, a lump forming in my throat as I contemplate the gravity of what I'm about to do.* "...July 31st, 11 AM."

Kurisu: *I repeat the date and time under my breath, my mind already working to calculate the necessary parameters.* "11 AM on the 31st..."

Okabe: *As Kurisu works, I start typing the D-Mail, my fingers moving swiftly over the keys, the message a desperate plea: Do NOT go!! Not @shrine! It’s a trap! I address the mail to the PhoneWave (name subject to change).* 

Kurisu: *I glance at Okabe, a nod of affirmation escaping me.* "Okay, all set."

Okabe: *I draw in a deep breath, steeling myself for what's about to come.* "Alright, activate it."

Kurisu: *Without hesitation, I reach for the switch, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Activated."

Okabe: *I press the send button, the familiar whir of the machine echoing in the lab. I wait for the onset of Reading Steiner, bracing myself for the vertigo that usually accompanies it.*

Kurisu: *I glance at Okabe, my brows furrowing as I notice the confusion etched on his face.* "...Well?"

Okabe: *I grit my teeth in frustration, the familiar sensation of Reading Steiner ominously absent.* "Nothing. Why won’t it change!?"

Kurisu: *I tilt my head, a frown tugging at the corner of my lips.* "Another mistake?"

Okabe: *I shake my head vehemently, my voice rising in desperation.* "No, there’s no way! I know what Moeka’s message said. This D-Mail should have canceled it." *Why isn’t it working? What the hell’s wrong this time?*

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, deep in thought.* "What did the first D-Mail say?"

Okabe: *I draw a deep breath, recounting the content of the first D-Mail.* "That the IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine. I tried to cancel it by telling her it’s a trap, but it didn’t work. I’ll try to phrase it differently."

Kurisu: *A sudden realization flashes across my face.* "Wait. We went through this with the LOTO SIX experiment, remember?" *The LOTO SIX experiment... Okabe sent himself the winning numbers, but the past him didn’t buy the ticket. Instead, he gave the winning numbers to Lukako.*

Okabe: *I nod, the memory of the LOTO SIX experiment clear in my mind.*

Kurisu: *I look at Okabe, my voice firm as I explain.* "The person who reads the D-Mail chooses whether or not to act accordingly. Kiryu learned that the IBN 5100 was at the shrine. Though the cancellation mail came right afterward, I guess she ignored it and went anyway."

Okabe: *I rub my temples, a sense of dread settling over me.* "Maybe she didn’t believe the cancellation mail. Or maybe she was so diligent she decided to check it out even when told not to." *I glance at Moeka. She’s still hanging her head, but her tears have run dry. I wonder if she’s listening.*

Kurisu: *I sigh, frustration creeping into my voice.* "Damn. Even when told it was too risky to go to the shrine, she went anyway..."

Okabe: *A spark of determination flares within me.* "We need a more persuasive message. Something that will prevent her from going to the shrine."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, curiosity piqued.* "Like what?"

Okabe: *I chew on my bottom lip, contemplating our options.* "What if I send a D-Mail to myself on July 30th? Could I beat her to the IBN 5100?"

Kurisu: *I shake my head, doubt clouding my face.* "Were you even interested in the IBN 5100 then?" *When did Okabe start caring about the IBN 5100? He can’t remember. Fine. That’s out. So how does he convince Moeka to listen?*

Okabe: *A sudden realization hits me, like an electric shock running through my brain.* "...FB."

Kurisu: *I blink, taken aback by the sudden outburst.* "What?"

Okabe: *I clench my fist, determination seeping into my voice.* "Moeka’s handler. She’s obsessed with FB. If the mail comes from FB, she’ll do whatever it says."

Kurisu: *I frown, a question looming on my lips.* "Do you have FB’s phone?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, the grim reality of our situation sinking in.* "No. They haven’t even met. We don’t know where FB is."
