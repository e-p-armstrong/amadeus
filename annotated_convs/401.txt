Okabe: *I watch Moeka, her fingers flying over her phone's keypad in a flurry of activity, her brow furrowed in concentration.* "So... time for another stakeout," *I announce, my voice a mix of determination and trepidation.*

Okabe: *I guide Daru to set up a wireless infrared camera on the telephone pole down the street, his nervous sweat glistening under the pale streetlights. We park a couple of blocks away and watch the video feed, every pixel a potential clue.* 

Okabe: *The next day, Tennouji leaves for work on his moped, the engine's purr fading into the morning haze. He returns after sunset, his silhouette a lone figure against the dying light. There's no sign of his daughter, Nae, or his wife. Something finally happens early Sunday morning.* "It’s them!" *I exclaim, my heart pounding against my ribs as I recognize the figures appearing on the screen.*

Okabe: *Moeka doesn't show much of a reaction, her face as unreadable as ever. I thought she knew them. I ask, but she denies ever meeting them. It seems this worldline’s Moeka has been cut off completely.*

Okabe: *As the morning sun begins to peek over the horizon, Tennouji comes outside and loads the IBN 5100 into the station wagon. The men get in and drive away, leaving a trail of dust in their wake.*

Moeka: "What now?" *Her voice is barely a whisper, lost in the hum of the city waking up.*

Okabe: *The station wagon's tail lights disappear in the distance. We decide to follow it, our pursuit ending at Narita International Airport.* "Tennouji’s wife might be FB," *I muse, my mind racing with possibilities.*

Okabe: *We are back in Akiba. As we start walking towards Tennouji’s house, my phone buzzes with an incoming call. Kurisu's name flashes on the screen. I answer it, her voice a sharp contrast to the quiet night.*

Kurisu: *I can hear the annoyance in her voice, a rare crack in her usually composed demeanor.* "I thought I asked you to keep me posted."

Okabe: "I’ve been busy," *I respond, my gaze fixed on Tennouji’s house looming in the distance.*

Kurisu: "Busy. Right." *Her voice drips with sarcasm. I can almost see her rolling her eyes.*

Okabe: *I can't help but chuckle at her reaction.* "Were you worried about me?"

Kurisu: "O-of course not! Why should I care what you’re up to? It’s just... Mayuri was really worried. I don’t want to see her sad. So at least give her a call, okay?" *Her voice softens, a gentle plea breaking through her hardened exterior.*
