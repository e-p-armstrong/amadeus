Okabe: *I find myself lost in thought, staring at Moeka's forlorn figure.* "This may just be wishful thinking. We’ll never know FB’s true intentions. But I want to believe that Tennouji did care for her, that there was a place for Moeka somewhere. ...What am I doing? Why am I trying to comfort Moeka? Maybe I’m just soft."

Kurisu: *Startling me out of my contemplation, Kurisu urgently calls out to me.* "Okabe! We need to send the D-Mail now." *The seriousness etched on her face pulls me back to reality.*

Kurisu: *Her gaze pierces mine, a sobering reminder of the situation we're in.* "Miss this chance, and you could be in a lot of trouble."

Okabe: *My eyes meet hers, acknowledging the shared understanding between us.* "Your goal is to save Mayuri, not take revenge on SERN. Right? ...I don’t want anyone else to be hurt because of the machine we built."

Okabe: *I sigh, conceding to the truth in her words.* "...Yeah. You’re right."

Okabe: *I glance at FB's phone in my hand, my mind racing with the implications of our next move.* "Do you think Daru’s still in the lab?"

Kurisu: *She quickly pulls out her phone, her fingers tapping swiftly against the screen.* "I’ll try calling."

Okabe: *As Kurisu contacts Daru, I turn my attention back to the message I'm about to send. It feels wrong to manipulate Moeka like this, but I remind myself that it's for the greater good.* "I’ll send the same message I tried to send earlier from Moeka’s phone. Only this time, it will be from FB’s phone. When Moeka sees it, she’ll believe it to be an order from FB. Knowing her dependence on FB, she’ll obey without question. It makes me sick to be taking advantage of Moeka’s vulnerabilities like this. How am I any different from FB?"

Kurisu: *She ends the call and turns back to me, her expression neutral.* "He said he’ll be there in five minutes."

Okabe: *I nod, acknowledging her update.* "So we just wait until then."

Kurisu: *Her gaze shifts to the side, a hint of uncertainty crossing her features.* "By the way, something weird happened back there."

Okabe: *My attention snaps back to her, a sense of unease creeping over me.* "Her... who?"

Kurisu: *She bites her lip, clearly wrestling with an unpleasant memory.* "Nae-chan. She ran out the back door. When I called her to stop... our eyes met."

Okabe: *I feel a cold shiver run down my spine at her words.* "She saw her father die... and ran away."

Okabe & Kurisu: *Our heads jerk towards the door at the unexpected sound.* "Wha!?"

Okabe: *Fear grips me as I see Moeka reaching for the door.* "Wait! Don’t--"
