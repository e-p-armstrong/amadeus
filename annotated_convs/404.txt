Nae: *I look straight into Okabe's eyes, my voice cold and devoid of any warmth.* "Okabe Rintaro."

Okabe: *A chill runs down my spine, my heart pounding against my ribcage.* "Nae, what...?" *I can barely get the words out, my voice barely a whisper.* 

Nae: *A sinister grin spreads across my face.* "I’ll come for you in fifteen years. I hope you spend them quivering in terror. Aha! Ahaha!" 

Okabe: *I watch in horror as Nae casually discards the knife and leaves, her chilling laughter echoing around the room. The sound of her footsteps slowly fading away, leaving us in a deafening silence.* 

Okabe: "Wh-what the hell was that? A demon?" *I stutter, my mind racing to make sense of what just happened.* "Was she possessed?" 

Okabe: *I feel my entire body shaking uncontrollably, my fingers trembling as I force them to move.* "W-what about Moeka!?" 

Kurisu: *I snap out of my shock, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Calm down!" *I shout, trying to bring Okabe back to reality.* 

Kurisu: *I quickly pull out my phone, my fingers flying over the keys.* "Check on Kiryu-san! I’ll call an ambulance. No, wait! Before that... Maybe you should just send the D-Mail." 

Okabe: *I feel a rush of anger at Kurisu's calmness, but I know she's right. I force myself to move, rushing over to Moeka's side.* "Moeka!" 

Okabe: *Even though she's my enemy, even though she killed Mayuri, I can't help but feel a pang of sympathy.* "Hang in there!" 

Okabe: *I shout desperately, my voice echoing around the room.* "Can you hear me!? Moeka!"
