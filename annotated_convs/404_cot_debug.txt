Planning:
- The scene involves Okabe, Kurisu, and Nae. Okabe is our main character and the point of view for the scene. He's a self-proclaimed mad scientist, often lost in his own world of theories and time travel. His actions and thoughts will be dramatic and heavy with emotion. Kurisu is a highly intelligent, logical character who often serves as a grounding force for Okabe. Her actions will be calculated and precise. Nae, on the other hand, is an innocent character who has a dark side in this scene, so her actions will be chilling and eerie.
- Anchor lines: Okabe's "Wh-what the hell was that? A demon? Was she possessed?" and Kurisu's "Calm down!".
- Thematic direction: The scene is intense and full of fear and confusion. The anchor lines will capture the shock and disorientation Okabe is feeling, as well as the desperate attempt by Kurisu to restore order.

Roleplay:

Nae: *I look straight into Okabe's eyes, my voice cold and devoid of any warmth.* "Okabe Rintaro."

Okabe: *A chill runs down my spine, my heart pounding against my ribcage.* "Nae, what...?" *I can barely get the words out, my voice barely a whisper.* 

Nae: *A sinister grin spreads across my face.* "I’ll come for you in fifteen years. I hope you spend them quivering in terror. Aha! Ahaha!" 

Okabe: *I watch in horror as Nae casually discards the knife and leaves, her chilling laughter echoing around the room. The sound of her footsteps slowly fading away, leaving us in a deafening silence.* 

Okabe: "Wh-what the hell was that? A demon?" *I stutter, my mind racing to make sense of what just happened.* "Was she possessed?" 

Okabe: *I feel my entire body shaking uncontrollably, my fingers trembling as I force them to move.* "W-what about Moeka!?" 

Kurisu: *I snap out of my shock, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Calm down!" *I shout, trying to bring Okabe back to reality.* 

Kurisu: *I quickly pull out my phone, my fingers flying over the keys.* "Check on Kiryu-san! I’ll call an ambulance. No, wait! Before that... Maybe you should just send the D-Mail." 

Okabe: *I feel a rush of anger at Kurisu's calmness, but I know she's right. I force myself to move, rushing over to Moeka's side.* "Moeka!" 

Okabe: *Even though she's my enemy, even though she killed Mayuri, I can't help but feel a pang of sympathy.* "Hang in there!" 

Okabe: *I shout desperately, my voice echoing around the room.* "Can you hear me!? Moeka!"
