Roleplay:

Moeka: *With the last of my strength, I manage to whisper,* "I had... nothing... except FB... The only... place... I belonged... I would... kill... to protect it... You’re right... to hate me... I’m... so...rry..."

Okabe: *I feel her hand growing colder in mine, the life slowly draining away. A strange calm settles over me, and I find the words coming to me without thought.* "I forgive you." *I speak them aloud, unbidden. The truth of them resonates within me. This Moeka, the one dying in my arms, has not killed Mayuri on this worldline. And yet, she offers an apology with her final breath. How can I not answer her?* "I forgive you."

Okabe: *I repeat the words, as if to convince myself of their meaning. I know they won't heal the wounds, won't mend the broken hearts. I don't even know if I truly mean them. But Kurisu's words echo in my mind. My goal is to save Mayuri, not avenge her. And so, here, now...* "I forgive you."

Okabe: *I watch as the pain fades from Moeka’s face. Her eyes, once filled with fear and regret, slowly close. A single tear slips down her cheek, and her hand, once tightly gripping mine, slips away. She is no longer breathing. I gently lay Moeka to rest on the cold floor, placing her purple phone in her lifeless hands.*

Kurisu: *I call out to Okabe in a weak voice, my heart heavy with the weight of the situation.* "...Okabe."

Kurisu: *I gather my strength, forcing practicality over my emotions.* "I think you should send the D-Mail. Everything’s ready at the lab."

Okabe: *My voice is barely a whisper, the reality of Moeka's death still raw.* "Yeah..."

Okabe: *A heavy sigh escapes me. Despite Moeka and FB being gone, Mayuri's fate remains unchanged. The universe still demands her death.* "Hey, Christina. When I send the D-Mail and change divergence, do you think Moeka’s fate will change?"

Kurisu: *I ponder his question, my gaze focused on the floor.* "Based on the attractor field model you spoke of... She’ll be more likely to live if divergence exceeds 1%. ...Sorry. I wish I knew what to say."

Okabe: *I shake my head, a sad smile tugging at my lips.* "Don’t worry about it."
