Planning:

Okabe: He's the protagonist, a self-proclaimed mad scientist who usually hides his true feelings behind a mask of eccentricity. He's caring and protective towards his friends. In this scene, he is conflicted and anxious about the information he's just learned, and there's a sense of urgency and tension. His *actions* will reflect his conflicted state, and his *thoughts* will be analytical, trying to make sense of the situation.

Moeka: She's a shy, quiet woman who is also a Rounder, working for SERN. Her *actions* will be minimalistic and subtle, reflecting her quiet personality.

Tennouji: He's not physically present in this scene, but his words haunt Okabe. His line will be integrated into Okabe's *thoughts*.

Nae: She's a young girl who, in another timeline, was turned into a murderer by Okabe's actions. Her line will be integrated into Okabe's *thoughts*.

Kurisu: She's a genius neuroscientist and Okabe's love interest. She's usually calm and collected, but in this scene, she's worried about Okabe. Her *actions* will reflect her concern, and her *dialogue* will be logical, trying to reassure Okabe.

Anchor lines: Okabe's line "What do you mean? Your supervisor? You mean FB?" will be enhanced to reflect his shock and realization. Also, Kurisu's line "Don’t worry about it, Okabe. Send the D-Mail right now. That’ll solve everything." will be amplified to portray her concern and desperation.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I watch as Moeka settles herself on the tatami mats, her movements subdued, not questioning my presence. She pulls out her purple phone and I can't help but stare as she begins typing a mail, her fingers dancing across the screen with an urgency I had almost forgotten about. I lean in closer, my heart pounding as I read the mail. It's as if we were just discussing the IBN 5100 moments ago...* "What do you mean? Your supervisor? You mean FB?" *I question, my voice a mix of shock and realization.*

Moeka: *She freezes mid-action, her eyes wide open, a gasp escaping her lips.*

Okabe: *A wave of relief washes over me at the confirmation of FB's existence, but it's quickly replaced with fear. I can't forget that he is my enemy. But right now, I am more intrigued by what Moeka implied. Did FB cancel her mission to retrieve the IBN 5100? I recall Tennouji's last words,* "Doing your duty sets you up for disposal. So we’re more like cattle than dogs." *A shiver runs down my spine. Could it be that he canceled her mission to prevent their elimination? But that wouldn't be enough to cheat death, would it? They are still doomed.*

Okabe: *Suddenly, Nae's words echo in my mind,* "I won’t forgive you, until I kill you with my own hands." *I instinctively cover my ears, trying to drown out that innocent yet hate-filled voice. I remember the girl I turned into a murderer. I bite my lip hard, the taste of iron filling my mouth. But that worldline has been undone, hasn't it? I shake my head, trying to clear it. I need to focus on the present. If the plan worked, the IBN 5100 should be back in my possession. And if that's the case... I don't need to stay on this worldline.*

Kurisu: *Her voice breaks my train of thought,* "...Okabe?"

Okabe: "Wasn’t there something strange about that girl?" *I ask, my mind still stuck on Nae.*

Kurisu: "That girl... you mean Nae-chan?" *She asks, her eyebrows furrowing in confusion.*

Okabe: *I simply nod in response.*

Kurisu: *She seems to understand,* "...She was like a different person."

Okabe: "What did she mean, she’ll kill me in fifteen years?" *I question, my anxiety evident in my voice. What was she implying? Does she know something?*

Kurisu: *She places a comforting hand on my shoulder,* "Don’t worry about it, Okabe. Send the D-Mail right now. That’ll solve everything." *She urges, her voice filled with concern.*

Okabe: *I pocket FB’s phone,* "I can’t pretend I didn’t see that." *I say, my voice firm. Nae’s crime is partly my responsibility. And I need to know what she meant when she promised to kill me fifteen years from now.*

Okabe: "I’m time leaping. Back to the lab." *I announce, determination set in my voice.*

Kurisu: *She sighs but I choose to ignore it,* "Our enemy? But..."

Okabe: *She glances at Moeka, then leans in to whisper into my ear,* "Isn’t she our enemy?"

Okabe: "...It’s about 7 AM, right?" *I ask, trying to change the topic.*

Kurisu: "Huh? Well, yeah, but where did that question come from?" *She asks, her confusion evident in her voice.*
