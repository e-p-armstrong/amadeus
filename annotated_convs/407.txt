Okabe: *I struggle to keep my voice steady, the pain in my arm a stark reminder of the situation.* "So you kill Moeka... but what comes next?"

Nae: *I blink, caught off guard.* "Next?"

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, the bitter taste of regret filling my mouth.* "Are you gonna repeat those fifteen years all over again?"

Nae: *I shrug nonchalantly, my voice devoid of any emotion.* "Hmph. What do I care about those fifteen years? There’s nothing for me there..." *With a final icy glance, I release my grip on Okabe's arm, my hands smeared with his blood.*

Nae: *I turn my back to him, my heart heavy with a hollow victory.* "I don’t need anything from you now. Just wait in fear and regret, Okabe Rintaro. Until I come for you in fifteen years."

Okabe: *I watch as she disappears into the darkness, powerless to stop her.* "Hahaha..." *A dry, hollow laugh escapes my lips, the absurdity of it all crashing down on me.*

Kurisu: *I rush towards Okabe, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Okabe!" *The sight of his bleeding arm sends a wave of fear through me.*

Kurisu: *I kneel in front of him, my hands trembling slightly.* "What happened!? Are you okay!?"

Okabe: *I glance at her, offering a weak smile to mask the pain.* "The phone..."

Kurisu: *I quickly hand him the phone, my mind racing with worry.* "I brought it, but..."

Okabe: *I take the phone from her, my fingers clumsily typing out a message.* "Calm down... I’m gonna send the D-Mail now."

Kurisu: *I nod, trying to steady my breathing.* "R-right. If the worldline changes, then this wound will go away."

Okabe: *I finish the message, my mind heavy with the weight of what's to come.* "Hey... why do you think Tennouji didn’t kill Moeka?"

Kurisu: *I blink, taken aback by his question.* "What do you mean?"
