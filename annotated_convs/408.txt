Okabe: *With a rush of adrenaline, I barge into the room. I feel the tension in the air lessen as the hour of Moeka’s death passes with no sign of Nae. The worldline has changed.* "What do you mean? FB told you to stop..." *My voice trails off, my eyes locked onto Moeka, who's right in front of me.*

Moeka: *Startled by my sudden outburst, I freeze, my phone clutched tightly in my hand.* "...!"

Okabe: *A wave of relief washes over me as I realize that FB is still alive, but it's quickly replaced by a chilling sense of fear. He is my enemy. Yet, I can't help but be intrigued by Moeka's words. Could it be that FB canceled her mission to retrieve the IBN 5100?*

Tennouji: *Looking at Okabe, I let out a weary sigh.* "Doing your duty sets you up for disposal. So we’re more like cattle than dogs."

Okabe: *Tennouji's words echo in my mind as I ponder over the possibilities. Perhaps he canceled her mission to avoid their elimination. Could he have been trying to save Moeka?* 

Nae: *My voice, usually soft and gentle, is now filled with venom.* "Live in fear and regret, Okabe Rintaro. Until we meet again in fifteen years."

Okabe: *Nae's voice, filled with hatred, haunts me. That innocent girl turned into a murderer because of me. The thought makes me bite my lip, hard enough to draw blood. But I won't let fear or regret consume me. Not anymore. That worldline has been undone. With a deep breath, I pull myself together and start my journey back to the lab. On my way, I pass by the Braun Tube Workshop. Through the window, I can see Tennouji, lounging in front of a powered-on CRT, engrossed in the sports pages. He's still alive, and his daughter, Nae, has no reason to hate anyone now. A sigh of relief escapes me as I climb the stairs to the lab, where only Kurisu awaits.* "Have you been to Kiryu Moeka’s apartment?"

Kurisu: *Interrupted in the middle of my browsing, I look up at Okabe, a confused expression on my face.* "...Huh? Moeka-san’s apartment? Never."

Okabe: "Oh, okay. It doesn’t matter. Just wondering." *With that, I make my way to the development room, my eyes fixed on the Time Leap Machine in the middle. But what catches my attention are the shelves.*

Okabe: *A triumphant grin spreads across my face as my eyes land on a large, familiar cardboard box.* "It’s here!" *Inside the box is the IBN 5100, the legendary retro PC that fate had stolen from me. Its return signifies the end of a long, grueling battle. We can save Mayuri!* "Daru! Daru! Where’s my super hacka!?" *I can barely contain my excitement, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Kurisu: *Startled by Okabe's sudden burst of enthusiasm, I look up from my screen.* "Uh, he’s not here. He went to ComiMa, remember?"
