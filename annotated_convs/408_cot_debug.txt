Character personalities and writing styles:
1. Okabe: Okabe is a complex character who often masks his emotions. His thoughts are deep and analytical. He's an eccentric individual who takes on a dramatic, flamboyant persona of "Hououin Kyouma," a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He often uses peculiar phrases and expressions. His actions and thoughts will be written in a detailed, introspective manner.
2. Moeka: Moeka is a shy, introverted woman with a dependence on her phone and FB. She often expresses herself in short, abrupt sentences. Her actions will be small and hesitant, showcasing her timid nature.
3. Tennouji: Tennouji is a stern, serious character with a hidden softer side. His actions will be firm and decisive.
4. Nae: Nae is innocent and naive, but in this context, she's filled with hatred. Her actions will be contrasting, showcasing her innocence and her newfound hatred.
5. Kurisu: Kurisu is a highly intelligent, tsundere character. She's often defensive, but also shows concern for others. Her actions will be a mix of aloofness and subtle care.

Planning and brainstorming:
I'll start with Okabe's entrance and his thoughts on the changed worldline. I'll focus on his relief and fear regarding FB. Okabe's line "What do you mean? FB told you to stop..." will be an anchor. I'll convey his desperation and confusion in this line. The scene where Okabe finds the IBN 5100 will be another anchor, showcasing his triumph and relief. 

Roleplay:
Okabe: *With a rush of adrenaline, I barge into the room. I feel the tension in the air lessen as the hour of Moeka’s death passes with no sign of Nae. The worldline has changed.* "What do you mean? FB told you to stop..." *My voice trails off, my eyes locked onto Moeka, who's right in front of me.*

Moeka: *Startled by my sudden outburst, I freeze, my phone clutched tightly in my hand.* "...!"

Okabe: *A wave of relief washes over me as I realize that FB is still alive, but it's quickly replaced by a chilling sense of fear. He is my enemy. Yet, I can't help but be intrigued by Moeka's words. Could it be that FB canceled her mission to retrieve the IBN 5100?*

Tennouji: *Looking at Okabe, I let out a weary sigh.* "Doing your duty sets you up for disposal. So we’re more like cattle than dogs."

Okabe: *Tennouji's words echo in my mind as I ponder over the possibilities. Perhaps he canceled her mission to avoid their elimination. Could he have been trying to save Moeka?* 

Nae: *My voice, usually soft and gentle, is now filled with venom.* "Live in fear and regret, Okabe Rintaro. Until we meet again in fifteen years."

Okabe: *Nae's voice, filled with hatred, haunts me. That innocent girl turned into a murderer because of me. The thought makes me bite my lip, hard enough to draw blood. But I won't let fear or regret consume me. Not anymore. That worldline has been undone. With a deep breath, I pull myself together and start my journey back to the lab. On my way, I pass by the Braun Tube Workshop. Through the window, I can see Tennouji, lounging in front of a powered-on CRT, engrossed in the sports pages. He's still alive, and his daughter, Nae, has no reason to hate anyone now. A sigh of relief escapes me as I climb the stairs to the lab, where only Kurisu awaits.* "Have you been to Kiryu Moeka’s apartment?"

Kurisu: *Interrupted in the middle of my browsing, I look up at Okabe, a confused expression on my face.* "...Huh? Moeka-san’s apartment? Never."

Okabe: "Oh, okay. It doesn’t matter. Just wondering." *With that, I make my way to the development room, my eyes fixed on the Time Leap Machine in the middle. But what catches my attention are the shelves.*

Okabe: *A triumphant grin spreads across my face as my eyes land on a large, familiar cardboard box.* "It’s here!" *Inside the box is the IBN 5100, the legendary retro PC that fate had stolen from me. Its return signifies the end of a long, grueling battle. We can save Mayuri!* "Daru! Daru! Where’s my super hacka!?" *I can barely contain my excitement, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Kurisu: *Startled by Okabe's sudden burst of enthusiasm, I look up from my screen.* "Uh, he’s not here. He went to ComiMa, remember?"
