Okabe: *I stride across the lab, feeling the weight of the moment as if it's tangible.* "Daru! Christina!" 

Kurisu: *I jerk awake, my heart pounding from the sudden shout.* 

Okabe: *I raise my hands, setting the stage for my proclamation.* "It’s time for the final phase of Operation Verthandi!" *I pause, expecting a reaction, but their blank stares only fuel my determination.*

Okabe: *I point at Daru, the excitement bubbling up within me.* "The IBN 5100, Daru!"

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, his sudden enthusiasm catching me off guard.* "...Yeah?"

Okabe: "Listen to me, man! We have an IBN 5100!" *I insist, my voice echoing through the lab.*

Itaru: "Of course we do. You’re the one who found it, Okarin." *I say, trying to bring him back down to earth.*

Okabe: "Yes! Yes I did! I found it at Yanabayashi Shrine!" *I declare, the memory of the discovery still fresh.*

Itaru: *I shake my head, chuckling under my breath.* "...Have you been drinking too much soda?"

Kurisu: *I rub my eyes, my patience worn thin.* "Let me sleep, for crying out loud. I was up all night."

Okabe: *I turn to Daru, ignoring Kurisu's complaint.* "A question, Daru. Have you researched how to use the IBN 5100?"

Itaru: "Huh? Well, yeah, I guess. Can you believe I did it while preparing for ComiMa? I’m like a saint or something. They’d knight me for this in England." *I smirk, playing along with Okabe's theatrics.*

Okabe: *I laugh, clapping Daru on the back.* "Then we shall call you Sir Super Hacka!"

Itaru: *I cringe, shaking my head.* "Hell no."

Kurisu: *I groan, massaging my temples.* "Will you guys shut up? You’re giving me a headache."

Okabe: *My mind races, the potential of the situation dawning on me.* "Hear me, lab mems! Our long struggle has at last reached its climax! Ragnarok is at hand! Now we must deliver the decisive blow. With the power of the IBN 5100, we shall crack SERN’s most secure database and destroy it from the inside! Through the cowardly apparatus known as Echelon, the enemy has acquired precious intelligence on our activities. Now they plot to steal our sacred time machine, upon which rest the hopes and dreams of all mankind! Beneath its scholarly trappings, SERN is a hive of scum and villainy, of men who would sacrifice innocent souls in their quest to rule all space and time. But now we are poised to crush them with the Hammer of Justice! And when we do, they will know once and for all by whose hand the wheel of fate truly turns! When the sun sets upon the battlefield, the foul System that rules the world will crumble! And from the flames, a new age will rise! An age of glorious, unfettered Chaos!" *I roar, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Kurisu: *I snap, my patience finally breaking.* "Argh! Shut up! What are you talking about!?"

Itaru: *I shrug, a wry smile tugging at my lips.* "Nobody can know the darkness in Okarin’s heart..."

Kurisu: *I glare at Okabe, my frustration boiling over.* "First, get your character straight! What kind of mad scientist talks about the Hammer of Justice?"

Itaru: "I guess he just got caught up in the heat of the moment. Maybe he regrets it now." *I muse, trying to lighten the mood.*

Okabe: *I wave them off, my focus unwavering.* "Come on, guys! Stop complaining and get ready!"

Itaru: *I blink, taken aback by his sudden change in tone.* "Get ready?"

Okabe: "To crack SERN! Weren’t you listening?" *I challenge, my gaze burning with determination.*

Kurisu: *I hesitate, my rational mind wrestling with the reckless idea.* "Uh, I don’t think that’s a good idea."

Okabe: *I scoff, dismissing her caution.* "When did you become a goody two shoes? Where’s your ambition!?"
