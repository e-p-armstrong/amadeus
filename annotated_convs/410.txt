Okabe: *I clench my fists, fighting the urge to grind my teeth. My gaze locks onto Kurisu, a mix of desperation and determination painting my features.* "That’s not the problem!" 

Okabe: *My voice echoes in the room, each word a testament to the countless hours, the sleepless nights, the sacrifices made.* "It’s taken me so long -- so long -- just to reach this point! This is my chance to escape the Alpha worldline and save Mayuri. I won’t let anyone get in my way. Anyone!" 

Kurisu: *She looks at me, her eyes searching for something in my face, her voice barely above a whisper.* "Okabe..."

Itaru: *Daru shifts uncomfortably, his glasses reflecting the dim light of the room as he looks at me.* "W-why so serious, man?"

Okabe: *My gaze drops to the floor, my voice taking on a bitter edge.* "I’ve got good reason. To them, only half an hour has passed since the Time Leap Machine was built. But to me, many days have passed since this ordeal began."

Okabe: *I bow my head deeply, my hands gripping the edge of the table.* "Please! Please, hear me out." *The weight of the world rests on my shoulders, the threat of Mayuri's death and a dystopian future looming over me.*

Itaru: *Daru claps me on the shoulder, a wide grin on his face as he thrusts his thumb skyward.* "I-it’s not like I’m cracking for you or anything, okay!?"

Kurisu: *She groans, rolling her eyes as she leans back in her chair.* "Oh god..."

Okabe: *My tense features soften as laughter bubbles up within me.* "Sir Super Hacka (tsundere version) is here to save the day. I couldn’t have asked for a better right-hand man." *As Daru hooks the IBN 5100 to his PC, I take a deep breath, preparing to lay out our situation once again.*

Okabe: *My voice is steady, each word carefully chosen as I explain our predicament.* "This all happened because of the very first D-Mail I sent to Daru. SERN intercepted that D-Mail with Echelon and figured out what it meant, then sent their Rounders after us. They will kill Mayuri, kidnap us, and steal the Time Leap Machine."

Okabe: *I take a moment, my gaze lost in the past.* "I tried to save Mayuri, but nothing worked. Every worldline converged on the same result, just as attractor field theory said they would."

Itaru: *Daru chuckles, adjusting his glasses.* "You know, if this is all in your head, I think you’ve got a career as a light novel author ahead of you."

Okabe: *I lock eyes with him, my voice firm.* "It’s true. All of it. To prevent Mayuri’s death... we need to escape from the Alpha worldline. And I think we can do that by canceling all of our changes to the timeline so far. That should return us to the Beta worldline, the worldline that existed before I sent that first D-Mail. There’s just one more step. We need to erase the first D-Mail from SERN’s database."

Kurisu: *Kurisu sips her coffee, her gaze thoughtful as she considers my words.* "Fascinating."

Itaru: *Daru turns to her, eyebrows raised in surprise.* "You believe him, Makise-shi?"

Kurisu: *She shrugs nonchalantly, her gaze still on me.* "In theory. I’d like to see objective data, but that’s obviously impossible."

Okabe: *I grin at her, a spark of hope igniting within me.* "Relax. Your Time Leap Machine worked perfectly."
