Plan/Thoughts/Brainstorming:
- Okabe: Protagonist, a bit dramatic and eccentric, but very intelligent and kind. His actions should reflect his inner turmoil and concern for his friends. Anchoring lines will be his realization and subsequent reaction to a horrifying truth.
- Kurisu: Intelligent and stubborn, with a curious streak. Her actions should reflect her determination and curiosity about the situation at hand.
- Itaru (Daru): Laid back and relaxed, very tech-savvy. His actions should reflect his ease with the technology they're dealing with, as well as his casual manner. 

First anchor line will be Okabe's realization moment, where he connects the dots about the first D-Mail. The theme will be realization and fear, with a focus on Okabe's internal struggle.

Second anchor line will be Kurisu's last line. The theme will be confusion and concern, with a focus on Kurisu's growing worry about Okabe's mental state.

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I cross my arms, my gaze fixed on Okabe, my tone steady and unyielding.* "Besides, we were already planning to crack SERN’s database, weren’t we? Fine. Let’s see what’s in there. If the mail data exists, then it’s proof that what you said is true."

Itaru: *I lean back in my chair, a smug smile creeping across my face.* "So what you’re saying is, ’don’t think, feel.’ Got it."

Kurisu: *I raise an eyebrow, looking slightly baffled.* "Uh, you lost me."

Okabe: *I chuckle, shaking my head at Itaru's misinterpretation.* "What he meant to say was, ’don’t think, do.’"

Itaru: *I push away from the desk, my large body seeming to take up the entire room. I stretch my arms above my head, the joints popping as I sigh in relief.* "Done bridging them. I need to tinker with the settings a little, but we should be up and running in about ten minutes."

Okabe: *I nod, my mind already racing ahead to what we might find.* "Alright."

Kurisu: *I look at Okabe, my expression serious.* "So the first D-Mail started everything... Was that the one you showed me at ATF? The one that said I died or something."

Okabe: *I swallow, my gaze fixed on the floor as I remember that terrible day.* "Right. I found you dead at Radi-Kan and sent Daru an email. Daru happened to be experimenting on the PhoneWave (name subject to change) at the time, so the discharge phenomenon occurred and the mail... was..." *My voice trails off, and a shiver runs down my spine as realization hits me. My heart pounds in my chest, the blood roaring in my ears. My hands ball into fists, my knuckles white as I grapple with the horrifying truth. The first D-Mail... the one that started it all...* "...!"

Kurisu: *I look at Okabe, my heart pounding in my chest. His sudden silence and the look of terror on his face send a shiver of fear through me. My stomach drops, a sick feeling of dread washing over me.* "What?"
