Okabe: *I scratch the back of my neck, avoiding her gaze.* "What are you going to do now? Head straight home?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to one side, considering.* "Actually, I was thinking of going to the lab."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, trying to sound casual.* "Need something?"

Mayuri: *I shake my head, a playful smile tugging at my lips.* "Not really, but it’s been a while since I got to relax with Okarin. I’m a little hungry, so I’ll buy some Juicy Chicken Number One on the way."

Okabe: *I stifle a groan, attempting to mask my unease with a shrug.* "Back to the lab, then."

Mayuri: *I glance at him curiously, a question forming in my eyes.* "Hey, Okarin. Why did you come with Mayushii today? You’ve never come with me to ComiMa before. You’re not interested in moe, right?"

Okabe: *I chuckle awkwardly, trying to deflect her question with humor.* "I like robot anime."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head again, not quite satisfied with his answer.* "So why did you come with me today?"

Okabe: *I hesitate, my mind racing for an acceptable answer.* "Well..."

Mayuri: *I wait patiently, my eyes filled with innocent curiosity.* "Well?"

Okabe: *I struggle to maintain a calm facade, forcing a casual smile.* "...I just felt like it."

Mayuri: *I blink at him, my smile fading slightly.* "Oh..."

Okabe: *Frantically, I cast around for a new topic, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Lukako..."

Okabe: *I rush to fill the silence, my words tumbling out in a rush.* "I thought maybe you’d managed to get Lukako to cosplay, so I came to laugh at him. Too bad he didn’t come."

Mayuri: *I nod, a faint smile returning to my face.* "Yeah... Luka-kun would be super popular if he did come, though. People would take his picture and post it all over the internet, then everyone in the world would see how cute he is! And after he became a superstar, Mayushii would see him on TV and think, ’wow, he’s gone so far...’"

Okabe: *I chuckle, a genuine smile tugging at my lips.* "It’s scary ’cause it’s true."

Mayuri: *I pause mid-step, turning around to face him.* "...Okarin?"

Okabe: *I blink at her, caught off guard.* "Huh?"

Mayuri: *I take a deep breath, my eyes shining with gratitude.* "Thank you for today."

Okabe: *I furrow my brows, confused by her sudden thankfulness.* "Why are you thanking me?"

Mayuri: *I giggle, clapping my hands together in delight.* "Ehehe! Well, like I said, this is the first time Okarin’s ever come to ComiMa with me. It made Mayushii really happy♪"

Okabe: *A sigh of relief escapes me, and I manage a small smile.* "Ah, but you know what would make me even happier? If you cosplay next time!"

Mayuri: *I gasp, my eyes lighting up at the idea.* "Really? You’ll cosplay for me?"

Okabe: *I chuckle, shaking my head in amusement.* "Only if you cosplay too. Lukako too... and Christina, of course. Convince them to cosplay first. If you manage that, then I, the great and insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, will grace ComiMa with my august presence."
