Okabe: *I steel myself, my heart pounding in my chest like a war drum.* "...Then prepare yourself. What I’m about to tell you is the absolute truth. And it could also be... your death sentence."

Kurisu: *I blink in surprise, my eyes widening slightly.* "...eh?"

Okabe: "Remember what I told you before? When we delete the D-Mail from SERN’s database, we’ll reach the Beta worldline, where Mayuri doesn’t die."

Kurisu: "And where SERN doesn’t take over the world, right. Everyone lives. Everyone is free. You made it sound perfect." *I say, my voice steady, my gaze firm.*

Okabe: "Perfect? It’s anything but. I showed you the first D-Mail, didn’t I? The one that started it all. On the Beta worldline, the events described in that D-Mail actually happened." *I feel the weight of my words, the gravity of what I'm about to reveal.*

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my throat dry as a desert. I grip the edge of the table until my knuckles turn white.* "Kurisu. On the Beta worldline... You die on July 28th. And according to the attractor field model, nothing can prevent that from happening. If I want to save Mayuri, I have no choice... but to let you die!"

Okabe: *I glance at Kurisu, my heart aching. She’s staring out across the cityscape, her eyes look distant. I see neither fear nor sadness in her face. She seems... accepting.*

Kurisu: "Hey, Okabe. How credible do you find this attractor field model?" *I ask, my voice calm, my eyes still fixed on the cityscape.*

Okabe: "Credible?"

Kurisu: "It’s all secondhand info from John Titor -- from Amane-san, isn’t it? I get that it’s the accepted model in 2036. But how exactly did scientists prove the existence of attractor fields?" *I question, my mind racing with possibilities.*

Okabe: "Are you trying to say the model may be wrong? But I know for certain that convergence exists. I’ve experienced it firsthand." *I retort, my voice firm, my gaze intense.*

Kurisu: "Even if they’re right about convergence... What about the relationship between worldlines?"

Okabe: "The moment I change worldlines, everything is reconstructed. Past, present, and future." *I explain, my hands gesturing as I speak.*

Kurisu: "But that’s just from your perspective, Okabe. Once you go to the Beta worldline, the ’me’ that your brain perceives will die. In other words, your perspective will have chosen the worldline where I die instead of the one where I don’t. However... Why can’t the world your brain perceives be different from the world my brain perceives?" *I argue, my fingers tapping against my thigh as I speak.*

Okabe: "So you’re saying worldlines are independent?"

Kurisu: "Like trains, maybe." *I suggest, a spark of hope in my eyes.*

Okabe: "Trains?"

Kurisu: "Um, let me give you an easy example..." *I say, pulling out my phone and starting to fiddle with it.*

Kurisu: "If I want to take the train from Akiba to Yokohama, which route should I use?" *I ask, my gaze focused on the screen of my phone.*

Okabe: "I didn’t know you were a railfan."

Kurisu: "It’s just an example. Geez. You choose to take the Yamanote Line to Tokyo Station, then transfer to the Tokaido Main Line for the rest of your trip." *I explain, my tone matter-of-fact.*
