Okabe: *I fumble with my phone, my eyes darting between the screen and Kurisu.* "Oh, yeah. It’s Mayuri."

Kurisu: *She gives a small nod, her eyes never leaving mine.* "Answer it. I don’t mind."

Okabe: *I press the green button, bringing the phone to my ear.* "...Hello?"

Mayuri: *Her voice comes out soft, almost hesitant.* "Ah..."

Okabe: *I furrow my brows, concern seeping into my voice.* "Mayuri?"

Mayuri: *She exhales, a small sigh that sends a chill down my spine.* "Yeah..."

Okabe: *My heart clenches as I see Mayuri’s face on the screen, devoid of its usual brightness for some reason.* "What’s wrong?"

Mayuri: *Her voice trembles as she speaks, her words piercing my heart.* "Um, I heard from Daru-kun that Okarin’s been acting kinda strange. Mayushii was so preoccupied with ComiMa, she didn’t really notice... Even though she usually notices right away when Okarin’s not happy... I’m sorry, Okarin."

Okabe: *I feel a lump in my throat, the words I want to say stuck in my chest.* "Don’t apologize. You’ve done nothing wrong."

Mayuri: *There's a pause before she speaks again, her voice barely above a whisper.* "Um, did something happen? Okarin?"

Okabe: *My heart feels heavy, my secret weighing on me like a boulder.* "I can’t tell her. I can’t. I’ve kept it a secret from her all this time. That’s the way it has to be." *I muster the strength to answer her, my voice sounding more confident than I feel.* "There’s... nothing wrong."

Mayuri: *She chuckles, but there's no joy in her laughter.* "Oh... You know, you used to talk to Mayushii about a lot of things, remember? Like, umm, the Organization’s four leaders. Their names are Back Turkish, Virginian Burp, Balloon Drag Queen, and Wide-eye Gore, right?"

Okabe: *I can't help but crack a smile at her mistake, the memories flooding back.* "...Black Tortoise, Vermilion Bird, Blue Dragon, and White Tiger."

Mayuri: *She giggles, her voice a bit brighter now.* "Yeah, that! You know, it was really fun talking to Okarin about stuff like that... But now... Um, Okarin? If Mayushii’s a burden... just say so, okay?"

Okabe: *My heart drops, her words hitting me like a punch to the gut.* "What!? I never...!"

Mayuri: *She laughs, the sound almost too cheerful for the heavy conversation.* "Ehehe. I’m hanging up now. If you feel like talking to Mayushii about anything, just call okay? Tutturu♪"

Okabe: *I stare at the screen, the call ended abruptly. She hung up on me.*

Kurisu: *She breaks the silence, her voice steady.* "What did Mayuri say?"

Okabe: *I feel a pang of guilt, my hesitation causing the ringtone to cut off.*

Kurisu: *She scoffs, her eyes narrowing in disappointment.* "You’re such a wimp. I’m disappointed in you."

Okabe: *I clench my fists, my voice barely a whisper.* "Aren’t you afraid of dying?"

Kurisu: *She raises an eyebrow, her gaze unwavering.* "Did you not hear what I just said?"

Okabe: *I start to respond, but an email interrupts me. I don’t want to argue with Kurisu any more, so I open my phone to break the conversation.* "I heard, but--"

Okabe: *I scroll through the email, my heart pounding in my chest.* "How are you a burden!? Don’t say things like that, dammit! Why is she only serious at times like this!?"

Kurisu: *She looks at me, her eyes filled with understanding.* "A burden, huh..."

Okabe: *I nod, my voice firm.* "I’ve never felt Mayuri was a burden. Not once."

Kurisu: *She gives a small nod, her voice soft yet firm.* "Then you should tell her that."

Okabe: *My mind races, doubts and fears swirling around.* "Maybe it wasn’t a good idea to leave Mayuri in the dark. She never looks like she’s thinking anything. And yet, she saw my doubt? Either way, I can’t tell her the truth."

Kurisu: *She calls my name, her voice steady and calm.* "Okabe."

Okabe: *I look up to see Kurisu sigh, then glare at me.*

Kurisu: *Her words hit me hard, her stern yet caring nature evident.* "The old you wouldn’t have worried about anything. Anyway, you should go see Mayuri. I’m sure she has a lot to say."
