Planning:
Okabe: Okabe is the main protagonist and the one who is constantly battling with his thoughts. He is torn between saving Mayuri or Kurisu. He is a dramatic character but in this scenario, he is more contemplative, introspective and haunted by his past failures. His thoughts will be heavy and melancholic, filled with regret and indecision. His actions will be subtle, reflective of his inner turmoil. 

Mayuri: Mayuri is the childhood friend of Okabe and a cheerful, bubbly character. She is naive and innocent, often oblivious to the grimmer realities surrounding her. She is fond of Okabe and the lab members, and her actions will be filled with warmth and joy. She will be expressive, her actions including light gestures and movements, showcasing her childlike innocence. 

The anchor line will be Mayuri's reminiscence of the past, which will be made more poignant and emotional. 

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I clench my fists, my nails digging into my palms. The pain is a stark reminder of the reality I'm facing.* "I’ve failed so many times to save her. I’ve watched her die again and again. Everything I’ve done has been to prevent that from happening." *I bite my lip, a bitter taste filling my mouth. The rawness of my emotions is almost tangible, a specter haunting me.* "And yet, have the memories of those deaths been tormenting her as she sleeps? I still have a terrible decision to make. Do I save Mayuri? Or do I save Kurisu?"

*I let out a sigh, the weight of my choice bearing down on me.* "There’s no perfect ending here. I can’t save them both. It’s one... or the other. If I choose Kurisu, then Mayuri’s dreams will become reality. I don’t want Mayuri to feel any pain." *I cast my gaze downwards, my vision blurring.* "Until now, I’ve thought only of saving her. That is my goal. But at the same time, I can’t let Kurisu die." *My thoughts are a whirlwind, crashing against the walls of my mind, each one hitting the same dead end.* "Again, my thoughts hit the same dead end."

*I glance towards Mayuri, her figure a silhouette against the sky.* "Mayuri hasn’t noticed me yet. She’s still staring at the sky, just as she was on the day I took her hostage. She’s talking to her grandmother in heaven."

Mayuri: *I clasp my hands together, a wide smile blossoming on my face.* "Oh, right! We have a lot more lab mems now, you know! There’s Chris-chan, Moeka-san, Luka-kun, and Feris-chan. There’s also Suzu-san, but she moved away. That makes eight of us. It’s really amazing."

Okabe: *I let out a soft chuckle, my gaze softening.* "On this worldline, they all became lab mems. However, not a single one of them has sent a D-Mail."

Mayuri: *I sway slightly, my eyes twinkling with excitement.* "You know, it was just Okarin and Mayushii at first. Back then, Okarin seemed kinda bored most of the time. But now, he’s having so much fun."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a small smile tugging at the corner of my lips.* "Is that how she sees it? Well... she’s not wrong. She really does know me, doesn’t she."

Mayuri: *I giggle, my hands flitting in the air as if trying to catch invisible bubbles.* "And that makes Mayushii happy too! It’s so busy, but it’s really exciting. Especially now that Chris-chan is here. She’s really smart, you know. She got a paper published in a famous magazine! Mayushii really admires her. She even made a time machine! Oh, but can’t forget Okarin and Daru-kun helped too."

Okabe: *I watch as Mayuri falls silent, her gaze becoming distant. She stands still, her eyes locked onto the sky.* "What could she be thinking?"

Mayuri: *I lower my gaze, my fingers tracing patterns on my skirt.* "But you know, sometimes I remember... Back when it was just the two of us. When Mayushii had only just become Okarin’s hostage. I’d go to the lab after school, but Okarin wouldn’t be there. So I’d tidy up the room, and decorate it with cute things. Then Okarin would finally show up a little later. Mayushii would say ’welcome back’. But instead of saying ’I’m back,’ Okarin would say ’Good work,’ like a big boss or something."

*My voice drops to a whisper, my eyes gleaming with nostalgia.* "Every day, we’d spend a few hours just hanging out, doing nothing, and then we’d go home together. We didn’t talk much, but it wasn’t bad. We were just there... together, you know? We’d sit next to each other on the sofa. Okarin would work on his big plans, and Mayushii would read manga or play games. And sometimes we’d have a snack together. It was so nice and relaxing... I never wanted to leave. I’d start feeling like a real hostage, and I’d laugh ’ehehe’ to myself. Then Okarin would turn to me and say..."

Okabe: *I find myself lost in the memories, the past resurfacing like the echo of a song long forgotten.* "I remember... It was four months ago. Still spring. The lab wasn’t as lively as it is now. It was an isolated bubble of slow-moving time."

*I glance at Mayuri, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Did something good happen?"
