Okabe: *I chuckle to myself, my eyes darting around our surroundings with a playful spark.* "Ah, it must have been an illusion. We could be under attack from Illusion Conductor, one of the Organization’s feared agents."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head slightly, my expression one of innocent concern.* "Oh... gotta be careful, then. But you know, I’m sure that Mr. Illusion Kidhugger--"

Okabe: *My laughter fades into a stern correction, my finger pointing at her in a mock reprimand.* "Conductor. Not Kidhugger."

Mayuri: *I nod, my eyes wide and earnest.* "I’m sure he’s not a bad guy."

Okabe: *I sigh, leaning back and staring into the distance, lost in thought.* It was nothing. Just meaningless chatter to pass the time.

Mayuri: *I twirl a lock of hair around my finger, my gaze lost in the clouds.* "I felt so happy there. So happy I could cry. I wanted to stay like that forever." *I quickly look at Okabe, my eyes wide and pleading.* "Ah! But that doesn’t mean I don’t like how things are now, okay?"

Okabe: *I watch as Mayuri shakes her head in denial. She finally stops looking up at the sky, and bows her head instead.*

Mayuri: *I wring my hands together, my voice barely above a whisper.* "You know, I haven’t talked to Okarin much lately. Maybe Mayushii’s getting a little lonely."

Okabe: *I rub the back of my neck, my gaze dropping to the ground.* It’s true. I haven’t had time to talk to her lately. But that’s because I’ve been fighting to prevent her death. To keep her dreams from coming true. All so that Mayuri will keep smiling. I never again want to see her cry like she did on the day her grandmother died.

Mayuri: *I look at Okabe, a small frown on my face.* "But you know, I don’t want to be a burden on Okarin."

Okabe: *I stiffen at her words, my heart aching.* That word again. Burden. I’ve never thought of her as a burden.

Mayuri: *I huddle into myself, my voice quivering.* "Mayushii’s just one big nuisance, isn’t she... Um, Granny?"

Okabe: *I watch as Mayuri lifts her face once more.*

Mayuri: *I bite my lip, my gaze pleading.* "...I can’t stay like this forever, can I?"

Okabe: *I jump up, my voice loud and defiant.* "Of course you can!"

Mayuri: *I blink in surprise, my mouth forming a small 'o'.* "Huh?"

Okabe: *When I finally speak to Mayuri, she turns my way with a surprised expression. Her face is so soft, so innocent. Slowly, her lips curve into a smile.*

Mayuri: *I beam at Okabe, my eyes sparkling.* "It’s Okarin♪ Wow, how’d you know I was here?"

Okabe: *I cross my arms over my chest, a smirk playing on my lips.* "I always know where my hostage is."

Mayuri: *I giggle, my hands clasped together.* "Hostage..."

Okabe: *I lean towards her, my voice dropping to a whisper.* "You cannot escape my grasp. Not ever."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a small frown creasing my brow.* "Oh... But don’t wear yourself out, okay? Mayushii’s a little worried."

Okabe: *I straighten up, my gaze stern and unyielding.* "...Hououin Kyouma is not so weak as to require your concern. When the time comes, I’ll tell you everything."

Mayuri: *I blink at him, confusion clouding my features.* "...Huh?"

Okabe: *I reach out and squeeze her shoulder gently, my voice softening.* "So stay with me until then, like you always have."

Mayuri: *I nod, my lips curving into a small smile.* "...Okay."

Okabe: *I watch as Mayuri stands up and turns to the grave once more. As an offering, she leaves a brand new white lily, as well as some dango dumplings.*

Mayuri: *I turn to Okabe, my hands outstretched.* "Let’s head back, Okarin."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a playful grin on my face.* "Shouldn’t we get some dango for ourselves first?"

Okabe: *I remember back when we used to visit the cemetery together, it was part of our daily routine to eat dango on the way back.*

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes wide and bright with anticipation.* "Ehehe! Of course♪"
