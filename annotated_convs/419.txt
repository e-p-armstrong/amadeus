Okabe: *My heart races as I spot Kurisu lying in the middle of the roof, her limbs spread wide as if she's making a snow angel. An image of her, covered in a pool of blood, flashes through my mind, chilling me to the bone. Is she alright? I break into a run, each step echoing my rising panic, but before I can reach her, she suddenly sits up and turns to face me.* "...Okabe."

Kurisu: *I sit up abruptly, my heart pounding in my chest. I was lost in my thoughts, and his sudden appearance caught me off guard.* "...Okabe."

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat as I let out a breath I didn't realize I was holding.* "You’re alive..."

Okabe: *I feel like an idiot for stating the obvious. To my relief, she doesn’t seem to have heard me. Instead, she busies herself with combing her disheveled hair with her fingers. I let out a silent sigh, my shoulders sagging with relief.*

Kurisu: *I force a small, strained smile, my fingers automatically moving to comb through my hair.* "Right. I forgot I might run into you here."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a hint of curiosity creeping into my voice.* "What were you doing?"

Kurisu: *I hesitate, my gaze dropping to the floor as I consider my answer.* "...Thinking."

Okabe: *My heart clenches at her words, and I swallow hard, my mouth suddenly dry.* "Oh..."

Okabe: *I can't help but wonder if she's been thinking about her death. I keep my thoughts to myself, though, and settle into silence. The tension is palpable, and the silence only makes it worse.*

Okabe: *With a forced smile, I break the silence.* "Looks like I’m in your way, so I’ll just go."

Kurisu: *I nod slowly, unable to meet his gaze. There's a lump in my throat that I can't seem to swallow.* "...Oh, okay."

Okabe: *As I'm about to leave, I feel something cold land on the tip of my nose. When I look up, raindrops start landing on my forehead. A sudden shower...* "Hey. It’s raining."

Kurisu: *I blink in surprise, looking up at the sky as the rain starts to fall.* "Huh? Oh, yeah."

Okabe: *Before I can react, the rain turns into a downpour, soaking us to the bone. I can't help but let out a surprised yelp.* "Whoa!"

Kurisu: *I scream in surprise, my heart pounding as the rain drenches me.* "What the hell!?"

Okabe: *Finally inside the building, I catch my breath, shaking the water off my clothes.* "That’s what you get for tempting the sky gods."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes at his comment, wringing the water out of my hair.* "You should’ve warned me sooner. Even my underwear’s soaked."

Okabe: *I chuckle, unable to resist the opportunity to tease her.* "Same here. I bet you’re glad it’s dark, huh?"

Kurisu: *I glare at him, my cheeks burning despite the cold.* "What do you mean?"

Okabe: *I can't help but grin at her reaction.* "If the lights were on, I’d be able to see everything."

Kurisu: *I gasp, my eyes widening in shock.* "...!"
