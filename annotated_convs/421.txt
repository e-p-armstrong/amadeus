Kurisu: *I frown, my fingers struggling to thread the needle.* "It’s wet, so it’s kinda hard to thread."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, my gaze fixed on the small sewing kit in her hands.* "...Did you really just happen to have that on you?"

Kurisu: *I shrug, trying to keep my voice steady.* "Get over it already. Is it really so wrong for me to have a sewing kit?"

Okabe: *I scratch my chin, a smirk playing on my lips.* "It’s not wrong. It just seems like you planned for this."

Kurisu: *I roll my eyes, my fingers continuing their dance around the fabric.* "So you’re saying I brought it with me because I somehow knew your coat was going to get ripped. Uh-huh. Ridiculous. And before you get the wrong idea, I’m not fixing your coat because I want to or anything, okay?"

Okabe: *I chuckle, leaning back against the wall.* "Nice tsundere line."

Kurisu: *I sigh, my eyes narrowing.* "Don’t mock me. You just happened to tear your clothes, and I just happened to have a sewing kit handy when you did. It’s coincidence. That’s all."

Okabe: *My smirk fades, replaced with a thoughtful frown.* "Coincidence... Hey... you didn’t time leap, did you?"

Kurisu: *I laugh, the sound echoing in the small room.* "So now you’re saying that I went back in time for the sole purpose of repairing your stupid lab coat. Uh-huh. Ridiculous. Ridiculous! There. It’s so important I said it twice. Comprendes?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, my lips curling into a half-smile.* "You’re right. If you had time leaped, you would’ve brought a towel, not a sewing kit."

Kurisu: *I shoot him a glare, my fingers finally tying off the thread.* "What’s that, sarcasm? All you do is complain."

Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu bites the thread, then hands me my coat. My fingers brush against hers as I take it.* "Thanks."

Kurisu: *I look away, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Um, by the way... it was dark, so I couldn’t really see. If it turns out bad, it’s not my fault. It was dark. That’s all. Oh, and I hope you like the color. Because I have no idea which thread I used."

Okabe: *I examine the stitches, my heart pounding in my chest.* "It’s... random?"

Kurisu: *I shrug, a small smile playing on my lips.* "Black, red, or pink. Those are the three possibilities."

Okabe: *I gulp, my fingers tracing the newly-sewn stitches.* "Let’s just hope it’s not pink..."

Kurisu: *I sneeze, my body shivering from the cold.* "Achoo!"

Okabe: *I frown, my gaze softening.* "Cold?"

Kurisu: *I nod, wrapping my arms around myself.* "I guess."

Okabe: *I take off my coat, holding it out to her.* "Take my coat."

Kurisu: *I look at the coat, then at Okabe.* "But it’s wet."

Okabe: *I shrug, my hand still outstretched.* "Well, yeah, but..."

Kurisu: *I look away, the silence filling the room. My mind races, searching for something to say, anything to break the silence.* "...Have you made your decision yet?"

Okabe: *I freeze, my heart pounding in my chest. I know what she means, and that's why I can't answer.*

Kurisu: *I hug my knees to my chest, my voice trembling.* "Sigh... You still haven’t made up your mind? You like Mayuri, don’t you?"

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by her sudden question.* "What?"

Kurisu: *I look into the darkness, my voice barely above a whisper.* "It’s probably just my imagination, but lately, I’ve been seeing things. Like a strange sort of deja vu. In these visions, you’re fighting to save Mayuri all by yourself. You never give up, no matter how much it hurts."
