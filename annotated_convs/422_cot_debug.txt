Planning stage:

Kurisu is a brilliant, determined young woman who is also a bit tsundere. She tends to be analytical and rational, but she can be vulnerable and emotional when dealing with the subject of the potential loss of her life or the lives of her friends. Her actions and thoughts will be a mix of scientific analysis, emotional reactions, and attempts to hide her fear and vulnerability. 

Okabe is a bit eccentric, often adopting the persona of a mad scientist, but he's also deeply caring and protective of his friends. He's currently dealing with a lot of guilt and fear about the potential consequences of his time travel experiments. His actions and thoughts will reflect his struggle to stay strong and make difficult decisions, his concern for his friends, and his determination to find a solution.

Anchor lines:
1. Kurisu: "Then you come to me for help. You’re so desperate, so earnest, that I just have to do what I can. N-not that I’m doing it for you, okay!? I just want to save Mayuri, that’s all. Anyway, these images are stuck in my head, like memories."
2. Kurisu: "You asked me if I wasn’t afraid. ...Of course I’m afraid. Maybe I’ll disappear. Maybe I’ll be left behind all alone. Or maybe only you will disappear and everything else will stay the same. The world will continue, and nobody will even know that you existed. I’ll go back to America as if nothing ever happened. Maybe... maybe... maybe! I feel hopeless, just thinking about all the possibilities. But even so!"

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I cross my arms over my chest, my gaze dropping to the floor as I struggle to articulate my thoughts.* "Then you come to me for help. You’re so desperate, so earnest, that I just have to do what I can. N-not that I’m doing it for you, okay!?" *I quickly avert my eyes, trying to hide the blush creeping up my cheeks.* "I just want to save Mayuri, that’s all. Anyway, these images are stuck in my head, like memories."

Okabe: *I can't help but nod in understanding, my fingers unconsciously curling into fists as I reflect on her words.* 

Kurisu: *I let out a sigh, running a hand through my hair as I stare blankly at the wall.* "I tried self-analysis. Maybe I’m mistaking dreams for reality, projecting my hopes and fantasies... I don’t know. But there’s one thing I do know. You have to save Mayuri."

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my heart heavy in my chest.* "...Aren’t you afraid?"

Kurisu: *I snort in amusement, a bitter smile tugging at the corners of my lips.* "You know, it kinda feels like we’re trapped in an ancient ruin."

Okabe: *I frown, puzzled by the sudden shift in topic.* 

Kurisu: *I glance around the dark, empty stairwell, my hands gripping the railing a little tighter.* "Like the world ended... And we’re the only two people left. I’ve been thinking. Say you go to the Beta worldline, and everyone else goes with you. What if I can’t go with you? What if I’m the only one left behind? Would the entire world become like this place? It’s just a theory... but I can’t help but wonder."

Okabe: *I struggle to find the right words, my mouth opening and closing a few times before I finally manage to speak.* "I..."

Kurisu: *I cut him off sharply, burying my face in my knees.* "Don’t make promises you can’t keep!"

Okabe: *I flinch at her harsh tone, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Kurisu: *I raise my head, my eyes welling up with unshed tears as I glare at him.* "You asked me if I wasn’t afraid. ...Of course I’m afraid. Maybe I’ll disappear. Maybe I’ll be left behind all alone. Or maybe only you will disappear and everything else will stay the same. The world will continue, and nobody will even know that you existed. I’ll go back to America as if nothing ever happened. Maybe... maybe... maybe! I feel hopeless, just thinking about all the possibilities. But even so!"

Okabe: *I'm taken aback by her outburst, my mouth going dry as I stare at her in silence.* "Kurisu..."

Kurisu: *I suddenly shiver, wrapping my arms around myself as I try to ward off the cold.* "Jesus, it’s cold!"

Okabe: *I watch her in the dim light, her shoulders shaking as she struggles to keep herself composed.*

Kurisu: *I let out a frustrated sigh, my fingers digging into my arms.* "It’s because of these wet clothes! This sucks. Anyway, enough of this nonsense. It’s nothing but conjecture. Baseless. Worthless. I want to cut open my skull and excise the part of my brain that comes up with these delusions."
