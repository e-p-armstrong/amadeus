Okabe: *I swallow hard, the words catching in my throat.* "But..."

Kurisu: *Her voice is firm, resolute.* "No buts. My answer won’t change. Save Mayuri."

Okabe: *The impact of her words hits me like a punch to the gut. I look away, clenching my fists so tight that my nails dig into the flesh of my palms.* "Are you telling me to give up!? To abandon you!? I could never do that!"

Kurisu: *Her voice echoes around me, a chilling command.* "You can, and you must! There’s no other way."

Okabe: *My voice cracks, the raw desperation seeping into my words.* "No! You’re our friend! I won’t abandon you!"

Kurisu: *My name rings out, sharp and clear.* "Okabe!"

Kurisu: *She suddenly drops to her knees, her fingers clutching at my collar. I can feel her desperation, her resolve. Her eyes bore into mine, hard and stern.* "Is there another solution? There isn’t, is there? I don’t want to live if it means sacrificing Mayuri! If you don’t save her, I’ll never forgive you!"

Okabe: *Her words pierce me, leaving me breathless.* "Guh..."

Okabe: *I hate this choice with no right answer. I hate the universe for being so cruel. And most of all, I hate myself for forcing Kurisu to speak these words when she is the one with the most to lose. Tears well up in my eyes, but I bite my lip and hold them back.* "But you’re right here! Why does it have to be this way!?"

Kurisu: *Her voice is a whisper, barely audible.* "Okabe..."

Okabe: *I tightly embrace her slender body. Her clothes are still wet from the rain, but all I feel is warmth radiating from the core of her being.* 

Kurisu: *Her voice is softer now, almost a whisper.* "Thank you. I know you’re hurting for me. But you’ve done enough. I’m fine, so just think about Mayuri, okay?"

Okabe: *I press my face into her hair, my voice barely a whisper.* "I won’t give up. Ever!"

Kurisu: *She suddenly pushes me away, her face hidden behind her hair. But her fists are trembling. Her body exudes raw fury.* "...Kuh!"

Kurisu: *Her voice is filled with a mixture of anger and disbelief.* "This is ridiculous! You... motherfucker!"

Okabe: *I stumble back, taken aback by her outburst.* "Whoa!"

Kurisu: *She advances on me, her words tumbling out in a torrent.* "I said I was fine! What do you mean you won’t give up!? Are you stupid? Wanna die? Are you trying to be a hero, you chuunibyou wackjob? Don’t make promises you can’t keep! Your stupidity is infuriating! Why can’t you just do as I say!?"

Okabe: *I open my mouth to respond, but the words die in my throat.* "I..."

Kurisu: *Her voice rises, her words sharp and biting.* "What’s the problem, huh!? If you weigh the options logically, saving Mayuri is the only--"

Okabe: *I interrupt her, my voice filled with defiance.* "Fuck logic!"

Kurisu: *She stares at me in shock, her mouth opening and closing as she struggles to find words.* "...!"

Okabe: *My voice echoes around us, the sound of my own desperation.* "I’m not God! Maybe I got close, but that’s not me! I can’t decide who lives and who dies anymore!"
