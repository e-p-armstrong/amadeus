Planning Stage:

Okabe: A young man caught in a terrible situation, tormented by his choices and their consequences. He is torn between saving his childhood friend, Mayuri, or his newfound love, Kurisu. His *actions* and *thoughts* will reflect his weary, tortured state — his body language will be slumped, his thoughts conflicted and desperate.

Kurisu: A brilliant scientist who is in love with Okabe, but understands the gravity of the situation. She's practical and pragmatic, but also deeply caring and concerned for Okabe. Her *actions* and *thoughts* will show her concern for Okabe, her practicality, and her hidden sadness.

Anchor lines:
1. Okabe: "I’ve hurt people... lots of people... just to save Mayuri. And yet, I don’t even feel guilty anymore. I feel like I’m losing my humanity."
2. Kurisu: "Look at yourself, Okabe. You look like you’ve aged a decade. Your heart can’t take it anymore. You don’t need to beat yourself up like this. Just accept the truth. Like I said, you can’t stay here. Go to the Beta worldline. Go to the world where Mayuri doesn’t die. Not just for your sake, but for mine as well."

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I spin around, my heart pounding in my chest at the unexpected sight of her.* "Why..." *I manage to stutter out, confusion etching lines of tension across my face.*

Kurisu: *Ignoring my question, I narrow my eyes at Okabe, fixing him with my signature glare.* "Time leaping is just running away," *I state firmly, my voice steady despite the tremor in my heart.*

Okabe: *I flinch at her words, my gaze falling to the floor. I rub my temples, feeling a headache beginning to throb.* "I’ve hurt people... lots of people... just to save Mayuri. And yet, I don’t even feel guilty anymore. I feel like I’m losing my humanity." *The words tumble out, raw and laced with self-loathing.*

Kurisu: *I frown at his confession, my chest tightening.* "Then why are you hesitating now?" *I challenge, my voice softening despite myself.*

Okabe: *I sigh, running a hand through my unkempt hair.* "...Maybe because my insurance, the Time Leap Machine, isn’t effective. Or maybe I just haven’t mastered it yet. Maybe I haven’t tapped into its full potential."

Kurisu: *I shake my head, a bitter smile tugging at the corners of my mouth.* "Running only makes it hurt more," *I say, looking away from him. I lean against the cool wall, my arms crossed over my chest.*

Okabe: *I glance up at her, noticing her distant gaze.* "Is Kurisu running too? From what?" *I wonder aloud, a sense of dread settling in my stomach.*

Kurisu: *I let out a soft sigh, my smile fading.* "Look at yourself, Okabe. You look like you’ve aged a decade. Your heart can’t take it anymore. You don’t need to beat yourself up like this. Just accept the truth. Like I said, you can’t stay here. Go to the Beta worldline. Go to the world where Mayuri doesn’t die. Not just for your sake, but for mine as well." *My voice is calm, but my hands clench into fists at my sides.*

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my gaze dropping to the floor. She's right. There's no perfect world where both Kurisu and Mayuri live. Memories of Kurisu flash before my eyes, bringing a lump to my throat.* 

Kurisu: *With a heavy heart, I reach out to touch his shoulder, offering him a small, sad smile.* "Thank you. I know you’re hurting for me." *The words hang in the air between us, a silent testament to our shared pain and the impossible choices we face.*
