Planning:

Okabe is an eccentric and melodramatic character who often sees himself as a mad scientist battling against an evil organization. He is also prone to bouts of intense emotion and deep thought. His *actions* will reflect this, being often exaggerated and dramatic but also capable of intense focus and sincerity. His *thoughts* will be complex and introspective, often brooding over his actions and their potential consequences. 

Kurisu, on the other hand, is a highly intelligent and pragmatic woman with a tsundere personality. She often hides her true feelings behind a veil of rationality and scientific curiosity. Her *actions* will be calculated and precise, but occasionally betray a deeper emotional undercurrent. Her spoken words will typically be direct and to the point, but with occasional hints of vulnerability and affection.

The anchor lines of this roleplay scene will be Okabe's "So, once more," and Kurisu's "Time is going by too fast. I could really use a word with Einstein right now..." These lines signify a turning point in their relationship and reflect the theme of fleeting moments and the relativity of time.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my hands trembling slightly at my sides.* "S-sorry to disappoint you."

Kurisu: *She blinks in surprise, her mouth forming a small 'o'.* "...eh?"

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest as I force myself to maintain eye contact.* "That wasn’t my first kiss."

Kurisu: *Her eyes narrow, a blush spreading across her cheeks.* "W-why you... You’re just a cherry boy!"

Okabe: *I clench my fists, feeling a mix of frustration and embarrassment.* "Shut up, virgin."

Okabe: *I glance away, my mind wandering to past events.* I remember playfully kissing Mayuri in elementary school. And just a little while ago, I forcibly kissed Moeka to silence her. But that was on another worldline, and now it never happened, so... I guess it doesn’t count?

Kurisu: *Her expression softens, her gaze dropping to the floor.* "So it wasn’t your first..."

Okabe: *I nod, trying to maintain a casual facade.* "Right. So it only left a weak impression. Probably not enough to become a long-term memory."

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, my heart pounding in my chest.* I’m lying, of course. I’ve never felt such an intense kiss as that. The shock was like a lightning bolt to the brain. But still, I’m lying. Because if I miss this opportunity, I’ll never be able to touch Kurisu again. This is my last chance.

Okabe: *I force a smile, trying to keep the mood light.* "So, once more."

Kurisu: *Her eyes widen, her cheeks flushing a deeper shade of red.* "Wha..."

Okabe: *I watch her closely, noting the way she fidgets and avoids my gaze.* Kurisu fidgets. She usually glares at me harshly, but now she’s avoiding my eyes.

Okabe: *I reach out, my hand shaking slightly as I wrap it gently around her waist.* "I don’t ever want to forget... so let’s make doubly sure."

Okabe: *My heart hammers in my chest as I pull her slender body against mine.* I decide to take the initiative. 

Kurisu: *She looks up at me, her eyes wide and a hint of fear mixed with anticipation.* "Th-then I guess there’s no choice..."

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat as I see her looking up at me shyly.* What is she worried I’ll do?

Kurisu: *She swallows hard, her voice barely above a whisper.* "Just a kiss... okay?"

Kurisu: *She bites her lip, her eyes pleading.* "Be gentle... okay?"

Okabe: *I reach up, my fingers trembling as I run them softly through her hair. I take a deep breath, bending down slowly towards her.* 

Kurisu: *She closes her eyes, her voice barely audible.* "Okabe... Mm..."

Okabe: *I feel a surge of warmth as we kiss, our lips moving awkwardly but earnestly against each other.* We’re both shy, so we end up pecking at each other’s lips like two small birds. Then we draw back and look at each other. Kurisu’s eyes are wet. Tears are running down her cheeks. I kiss them away. They’re salty.

Kurisu: *Her voice trembles, her eyes filled with a mix of sadness and longing.* "Don’t forget me..."

Okabe: *I pull her closer, our bodies pressing together as we share a second, more intense kiss.* We press our lips together again. Stronger than the first time. Longer than the first time. I never want to let go. We embrace each other tightly, our feelings too powerful to contain.

Kurisu: *She lets out a soft sigh, her body relaxing against mine.* "mm..."

Okabe: *We hold each other close, our breaths mingling as we seek comfort in each other's presence.* We seek each other’s warmth again and again. Locked in our embrace, we feel each other’s breath. We feel each other’s scent. We feel each other’s taste.

Kurisu: *She pulls back slightly, her gaze focused on my face.* "It’s too fast..."

Okabe: *I can feel the warmth of her breath against my skin as she whispers these words, her voice resonating through our close embrace.* 

Kurisu: *She smiles, a hint of her usual scientific curiosity returning.* "Time is going by too fast. I could really use a word with Einstein right now. Time is not absolute. Einstein proved that time could be fast or slow, depending on the observer. Hey, Okabe. The theory of relativity is so romantic... ...and so sad, don’t you think?"
