Okabe: *I swallow hard, the lump in my throat making it difficult to speak.* "Are you sure I shouldn’t call Mayuri and Daru?"

Kurisu: *I look away, struggling to hide the tremor in my voice.* "...I think that would just make it harder. But you, I have no trouble leaving behind. ...That was a joke."

Okabe: *I see her struggling to keep her composure, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. I feel a pang in my heart, but I must be strong. For her. For us.* "This is a souvenir. Take it." *I present her with Future Gadget No. 2: The Bamboo Helicam, hoping it would serve as a tangible memory of our time together.*

Kurisu: *I glance at the gadget, a flicker of amusement crossing my face.* "Uh... no thanks."

Okabe: *I insist, pushing the helicam closer to her.* "Just take it. It’s not even that bulky." *My heart aches as I see her accept the gadget with a strained smile. The silence that follows is deafening.*

Okabe: *I break the silence, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Sorry I couldn’t go with you to Aomori..."

Kurisu: *I nod, a faint smile playing on my lips.* "Yeah... But these two weeks were fun, in their own way. Give my regards to Mayuri and Hashida, okay?"

Okabe: *I watch as she spreads her arms wide. Without a moment’s hesitation, I step forward, and embrace her. The girl genius who has been my pillar of strength, my confidante.* 

Kurisu: *I hold him tighter, whispering words of encouragement.* "Hang in there, Okabe."

Okabe: *I pull away, meeting her gaze.* "...Stay well."

Okabe: *I watch as she walks away, her figure growing smaller with each passing second. The sadness is overwhelming, but I must remain strong. For Mayuri. For the future.* "I... I will remember you, Makise Kurisu. I will remember your warmth. I will never forget!" *I don't know if she hears my words, but I see her shoulders trembling. I stand there, watching her until she disappears from sight, a part of me wishing I could run after her, but I remain rooted to the spot, the reality of our parting sinking in.*

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, steeling myself for what's to come.* "The time has come. We will now commence the final phase of Operation Verthandi."
