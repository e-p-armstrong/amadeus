Itaru: *I glance at Okabe, my fingers drumming lightly on the keyboard in front of me.* "...You sure?"

Okabe: *I nod, my gaze steady despite the tension knotting my stomach.* "...Yeah."

Itaru: *I flash him a quick grin, trying to lighten the mood.* "Okey-dokey!"

Itaru: *I start typing on the IBN 5100, my fingers moving quickly and confidently over the keys. The machine hums under my touch as it connects to my main computer.* 

Okabe: *While Itaru works, I wander into the development room, my gaze drawn to the Time Leap Machine. I squat down, my fingers gently brushing over the cool surface of the microwave. Its metallic chill sends a shiver up my spine. The machine has brought both joy and sorrow into our lives, but the tool is not to blame. I stand up, resolute. Once this is over, I'll destroy it. We can't afford to make the same mistakes again.*

Itaru: *I let out a triumphant whoop, causing Okabe to startle.* "Okarin, I found it! It’s really there!"

Okabe: *I rush over, my heart pounding in my chest.* "The D-Mail I sent? It’s there!?"

Itaru: *I point to the screen, a wide grin stretching across my face.* "It sure is, man."

Okabe: *Mayuri takes my hand, her grip firm despite her trembling. I pat her head gently, trying to reassure her.* "It’s okay."

Itaru: *I stand up, gesturing towards the open seat.* "Everything’s set. One press of the enter key, and that data’s gone. I leave that honor to you, Okarin."

Okabe: *I sit down, my fingers hovering over the keyboard. This is it. The end of the road. I close my eyes, a vision of Kurisu floating through my mind. Goodbye, Kurisu.* 

Okabe: *I raise my hand, my index finger poised over the enter key.* "Victory is at hand!"

Okabe: *I throw my head back, letting out a laugh that echoes through the room.* "With unimaginable brilliance and unwavering conviction, I have defeated our vast and powerful enemy and now stand triumphant on the field of Ragnarok! I give thanks to the comrades... whose sacrifice made this victory possible!"
