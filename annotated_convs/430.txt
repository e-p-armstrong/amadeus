Okabe: *My heart beats wildly in my chest, a cacophonous drum heralding the arrival of a new world.* "The coming world... is the world I wished for!" *I declare, my voice echoing in the lab.*

Okabe: *A bitter truth gnaws at the corners of my mind.* 'I wished for Mayuri to live, and Kurisu to die. That is the truth. And I must never forget it.'

Okabe: *I raise my hand, pointing towards an unseen future.* "This is the choice of Steins Gate!" *I proclaim, the words bitter on my tongue.* 'This is the choice of Okabe Rintaro.'

Okabe: *My heart is heavy with the weight of my decision, but I force the words out, a desperate plea to the universe.* "Let the world be reborn!"

Okabe: *With a swift motion, I swing down my index finger towards the keyboard. And at the exact same moment, the familiar creak of the lab door opening reaches my ears.* 'My eyes dart towards the sound.'

Kurisu: *Her voice is barely a whisper, a soft gasp that fills the room.* "--!"

Okabe: *There, in the doorway, stands Kurisu. Her face is flushed, as if she's been running. Why is she here? She should be on her way to the airport by now. Her eyes meet mine, glistening with unshed tears, but her face is all smiles. Could it be that she came back for me? In the frozen silence of the lab, I imagine I hear her voice. We didn’t say goodbye, she seems to say. The next moment, my finger strikes the enter key and the world starts to warp.*

Okabe: *I can feel the pull of the vortex, my consciousness being sucked into it. Reading Steiner. The timeline is changing. The warp accelerates. Kurisu. Daru. Mayuri. Everything inside the lab is shifting. Color fades as my consciousness leaves this worldline.*

Okabe: *Desperate, I turn towards Kurisu, trying to etch this last sight of her into my memory. She raises her hand, her lips parting to form words.*

Kurisu: "Goodbye. Okabe, I lo--"

Okabe: *As the world gradually stops spinning, color starts to seep back into my vision. I look towards the door where she stood just a moment ago. My assistant, Christina... Makise Kurisu. Now, she's gone, vanished like a fleeting dream.*

Okabe: *I glance around the room, at Daru seated next to me, at Mayuri standing behind me. Everything is where it should be. It looks like nothing has changed at all.* 'My coat isn’t torn. The stitches, uneven from having been sewn in the dark, have disappeared. There’s no trace of that ridiculous pink thread.'

Okabe: *I stand up, walking over to the development room. Underneath the table, the Time Leap Machine... No. That’s not the Time Leap Machine. That’s the PhoneWave (name subject to change). The upgrades Kurisu made are gone. Nothing has changed. This world is exactly the same. In all respects save one. Kurisu... was never here. Every trace of her has vanished. Kurisu is nowhere now. Nowhere, except in my memories. Mayuri and Daru are looking at me.*

Okabe: *I swallow hard, forcing the words out.* "...Hey, who was Lab Mem 004 again?" *I ask, even though I know what the answer will be.*

Mayuri: *Her voice is soft, innocent.* "Okarin, there isn’t a 4th lab mem, remember?"

Itaru: *He chimes in, light-hearted as always.* "Are you going to introduce a new member? Requesting cute girl."

Okabe: *My voice is barely a whisper, a final admission of the truth.* "...No."
