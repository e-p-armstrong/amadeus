Okabe: *I throw my head back, my laughter echoing through the room.* "The last battle of Ragnarok is won! I, the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, with an IQ rivaling that of Einstein himself, have thwarted the Organization, outsmarted SERN-- And conquered the whole of space and time! Now, at the moment of my triumph, I stand before you as a god!" *I spread my arms wide, my chest heaving with exhilaration.* "This brave new world is the fruit of my ambition! The hated System shall collapse, and chaos shall rule the Earth! This truly is the choice of Steins--"

Mayuri: *I interrupt him, stepping forward to wrap my arms around him.* "Okarin."

Okabe: *I freeze, my arms falling to my sides, caught off guard by the sudden embrace.* "Mayuri...?"

Mayuri: *I look up at him, a gentle smile lighting up my face.* "It’s okay now."

Okabe: *I furrow my brows, confusion seeping into my voice.* "Wha... what are you saying? I must proclaim our glorious victory, that all may--"

Mayuri: *I tighten my grip on him, my voice soft yet firm.* "But Okarin... you look like you’re about to cry."

Okabe: *Her words hit me like a sledgehammer, shattering the wall I had built around my emotions. The realization that I no longer have to bear the weight of the world on my shoulders washes over me. Mayuri, the girl I had sworn to protect, was safe. The girl I had sacrificed my love for, was gone. But the memory of her warmth, her soft lips, her last words, they all come rushing back, overwhelming me.*

Itaru: *From the corner of my eye, I see Daru, his expression a mixture of surprise and concern.* "Whoa, man. Are you really crying?"

Okabe: *My vision blurs, my tears spilling over, tracing wet paths down my cheeks.* "I... I..."
