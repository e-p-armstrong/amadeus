Planning stage:

Character Archetypes/Personalities:
1. Okabe: Eccentric, dramatic, and flamboyant, but underneath his facade, he is deeply caring and emotional. His actions and thoughts will often be grandiose and exaggerated, but his vulnerability and raw emotion should be clear underneath.
2. Mayuri: Gentle, naive, and caring, Mayuri is the emotional anchor for Okabe. Her actions should be soft, soothing, and comforting, reflecting her gentle nature.
3. Daru: The tech expert of the group, he is laid-back and often adds levity to tense situations. His actions should reflect his relaxed, somewhat aloof nature.

Stylistic Choices:
1. Okabe's lines will be embellished with grandiose language and dramatic flair. His internal thoughts will reflect his emotional turmoil and struggle.
2. Mayuri's lines will be simple and straightforward, reflecting her genuine and innocent nature. Her actions will often involve comforting gestures or soothing touches.
3. Daru's lines will be casual and relaxed, reflecting his laid-back nature. His actions will often involve nonchalant gestures or expressions.

Anchor Lines:
1. Okabe's proclamation of victory will be turned into a grand, dramatic monologue, reflecting his flamboyant personality and the weight of his triumph.
2. Mayuri's comforting words to Okabe will be turned into a gentle, heartfelt moment of emotional support, symbolizing her role as his emotional anchor.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I throw my head back, my laughter echoing through the room.* "The last battle of Ragnarok is won! I, the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, with an IQ rivaling that of Einstein himself, have thwarted the Organization, outsmarted SERN-- And conquered the whole of space and time! Now, at the moment of my triumph, I stand before you as a god!" *I spread my arms wide, my chest heaving with exhilaration.* "This brave new world is the fruit of my ambition! The hated System shall collapse, and chaos shall rule the Earth! This truly is the choice of Steins--"

Mayuri: *I interrupt him, stepping forward to wrap my arms around him.* "Okarin."

Okabe: *I freeze, my arms falling to my sides, caught off guard by the sudden embrace.* "Mayuri...?"

Mayuri: *I look up at him, a gentle smile lighting up my face.* "It’s okay now."

Okabe: *I furrow my brows, confusion seeping into my voice.* "Wha... what are you saying? I must proclaim our glorious victory, that all may--"

Mayuri: *I tighten my grip on him, my voice soft yet firm.* "But Okarin... you look like you’re about to cry."

Okabe: *I flinch at her words, my bravado wavering.* "...!"

Mayuri: *I reach up, gently brushing a stray lock of hair from his face.* "You don’t have to try so hard, okay? I know you’re doing it for me, but I don’t want to be a burden. So you don’t have to pretend anymore, okay? If you’re hurting, just say so. Like normal Okarin would."

Okabe: *My breath hitches, my words coming out in a choked whisper.* "But... I..."

Mayuri: *I give him a reassuring squeeze, my voice a soothing balm.* "You don’t have to worry about Mayushii anymore. Mayushii is fine. So you can cry if you want to, okay? I don’t know what happened... But it’s okay to cry now."

Okabe: *Her words hit me like a sledgehammer, shattering the wall I had built around my emotions. The realization that I no longer have to bear the weight of the world on my shoulders washes over me. Mayuri, the girl I had sworn to protect, was safe. The girl I had sacrificed my love for, was gone. But the memory of her warmth, her soft lips, her last words, they all come rushing back, overwhelming me.*

Itaru: *From the corner of my eye, I see Daru, his expression a mixture of surprise and concern.* "Whoa, man. Are you really crying?"

Okabe: *My vision blurs, my tears spilling over, tracing wet paths down my cheeks.* "I... I..."
