Itaru: *I shake my head, my gaze lingering on the dismantled remnants of our once cherished invention.* "Man, what a waste. That thing was worth a fortune."

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to one side, my brows knitted together in concern.* "And now we don’t have a microwave... How will Mayushii eat her Juicy Chicken Number One?"

Okabe: *I offer her a reassuring smile, my hand reaching out to pat her on the head.* "Come on. I’ll get you a new microwave."

Okabe: *I stare at the remains of the PhoneWave, my heart heavy with a mixture of relief and regret.* We no longer need the PhoneWave, that miraculous time machine built by coincidence. It brought Kurisu into my life. But at the same time, it made many people suffer. It must never be used again. Not by me. Not by anyone. It’s time for the PhoneWave to die. And with it, the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, lord of space and time. *I recall what Kurisu once said, her words echoing in my mind like a haunting melody.*

Kurisu: *My voice resonates in his memory, a mere echo of the past.* "I don’t want to deny who I’ve been. Because even my failures are a part of who I am today."

Okabe: *I look up at the sky, the bright sunlight making me squint. A single star is visible, a beacon amidst the daylight. Perhaps it's Venus. Kurisu's words come back to me, a bittersweet reminder of our shared past.*

Kurisu: *My voice rings out in his memory once more, a ghostly whisper in the wind.* "Going to the past is possible right now. Look into the sky at night, and you can see how things were tens of thousands of years ago."

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, my eyes moving from the sky to the satellite that has crashed into the rooftop. My heart skips a beat.* "No way..."

Mayuri: *I gasp, my eyes wide with surprise.* "Wow! What’s that?"

Itaru: *I squint at the object, a smirk playing on my lips.* "It’s a robot, right? The transforming kind?"
