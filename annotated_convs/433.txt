Suzuha: *With a stern expression, I look at the man standing before me.* "...Okabe Rintaro?"

Okabe: *I gasp, my eyes widening in disbelief.* "Suzuha!" *I feel a rush of recognition, my mind is flooded with memories of her - the part-time warrior, John Titor, the time traveler from 2036, Daru’s daughter.*

Okabe: *My heart races as I try to make sense of the situation.* "Why are you here!?" *The question slips out, echoing the one I had asked her over the phone. I need answers, but the sight of her is so bewildering.*

Suzuha: *My gaze remains steady, searching his face for recognition.* "Are you Okabe Rintaro? I need to know."

Okabe: *I stutter, taken aback by her question.* "Y-yeah..." *I take a moment to study her. She seems different. The worn camouflage gear, the grimy gun slung over her shoulder - it's as if she has stepped out of a war zone. Is this really Amane Suzuha?*

Okabe: *I hold up a hand, trying to calm my racing thoughts.* "Hold on. Just hold on one second." *I struggle to reconcile the Suzuha standing before me with the Suzuha from my memories - the one who leapt to 1975, who passed away in the year 2000.*

Suzuha: *I hold his gaze, my voice steady despite the urgency of my message.* "I’m a time traveler from the year 2036. I have a request for Uncle Okarin." 

Mayuri: *I tilt my head to the side, my eyes wide with confusion.* "You’re an uncle?"

Suzuha: *Ignoring Mayuri's question, I step forward, my gaze never wavering from Okabe's.* "This worldline is headed for World War Three! I need your help to prevent it! Please, help me change the future!"

Okabe: *I stagger back, her words hitting me like a sledgehammer.* "Wha... what the... What the hell are you talking about!?"

Mayuri: *I gasp, my hands flying to my mouth in shock.* "World War Three? Oh no! That’s really bad!"

Itaru: *I scratch my head, my eyebrows furrowed in thought.* "Uh, are you really a time traveler? You’re not just messing with us here?"

Suzuha: *I glance at Itaru, my voice firm.* "Stay out of this, Dad."

Itaru: *I nearly choke on my own spit, my eyes wide with surprise.* "D-Dad!? W-whoa... that was a shock. I mean, it’s not every day a mysterious beauty calls me dad. Though to be honest, I’d prefer to be called big brother."

Okabe: *I raise my hands, trying to regain control of the situation.* "Wait! Everyone just wait! Let me think!" *I take a deep breath, forcing my mind to focus on the puzzle before me.*

Okabe: *I turn to Suzuha, a question burning on my lips.* "Is that thing a time machine?"

Suzuha: *I nod, my expression unreadable.* "That’s right."

Okabe: *I glance at the machine, my mind racing with questions.* "Your father built it?"

Suzuha: *I glance at Daru, my voice barely more than a whisper.* "That’s right."

Okabe: *I swallow hard, forcing the next question out.* "Where did you come from?"

Suzuha: *I meet his gaze, my voice steady as I reveal the truth.* "The year 2036. I stopped in 1975 and 2000 first."

Okabe: *I blink, the implications of her words crashing down on me.* "You... what?"
