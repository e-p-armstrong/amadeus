Suzuha: *I square my shoulders, trying to imbue every word with the gravity it deserves.* "It wouldn’t be much of a time machine otherwise."

Okabe: *I feel a twinge of unease.* "You’re... from a different future?" *I ask, my heart pounding against my ribcage.*

Suzuha: *I tilt my head, a hint of confusion creasing my forehead.* "A different future?"

Okabe: *I clench my fists, my knuckles turning white.* "What’s going on in 2036? What about SERN’s dystopia?"

Suzuha: *I frown, my brows knitting together in genuine bewilderment.* "SERN? What’s that?"

Okabe: *I swallow hard, realization dawning on me like a cold winter morning.* "You said something about World War Three?"

Suzuha: *I nod, my gaze distant and haunted.* "Right. In my time, humanity has been reduced to less than a billion people."

Itaru: *I gasp, the air escaping my lungs in a rush.* "Less than a billion? But the population now is like 6. 7 billion. Are you saying 5. 7 billion people died!?"

Suzuha: *I look each of them in the eye, my voice steady despite the horrifying truth I'm revealing.* "That’s what happens when you use nuclear weapons. It was just like the Cold War. Only this time, they were fighting over time travel technology. It started with a race between the EU and Russia. Then the Americans got involved, and things really went to hell. They were all desperate to stop anyone else from being first to build a time machine. Whoever controls time controls the world, right?"

Okabe: *A shiver runs down my spine. Time travel, once again, has proved to be a double-edged sword, capable of both granting dreams and shattering realities.* "This can’t be happening..." *I whisper, my legs giving way beneath me.*

Mayuri: *I kneel beside Okabe, my hand gently rubbing his back.* "Are you okay?"

Okabe: *I glare at Suzuha, my heart aching with a sense of betrayal.* "Why is this happening!? You lied to me! You said a peaceful future was waiting for us on the Beta worldline!"

Suzuha: *I take a deep breath, steeling myself for the confrontation.* "We’re at a point of great divergence, when--"

Okabe: *I cut her off, my voice raw with emotion.* "I know that already!"

Suzuha: *I grit my teeth, frustration seeping into my words.* "Then you understand! 5. 7 billion people are going to die, and the survivors will be left with no future! No hope! I came here to prevent that. And to do that, I need your help, Uncle Okari--"

Okabe: *I shake my head, a bitter laugh escaping my lips.* "I refuse!"

Suzuha: *I gasp, my words hanging unfinished in the air.* "--!"
