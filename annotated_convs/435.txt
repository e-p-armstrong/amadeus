Okabe: *The realization hits me like a punch to the gut. I can't go back. Not to the worldline where Mayuri dies.* "I don’t care if 5.7 billion people die! I won’t let her... I won’t let Kurisu’s sacrifice be in vain!" *The words echo in the room, a testament to my resolve.*

Suzuha: *Staring at me in disbelief, she struggles to find words.* "Wait. You mean you’ve been to another attractor field? Wow. So that’s the power of Reading Steiner."

Okabe: *I blink, surprised.* "...How do you know about that?"

Suzuha: *She smiles, a secret in her eyes.* "Dad told me. And I’ve met you before, Uncle Okarin. In the future, that is."

Okabe: *My mind races.* "You’ve... met me?"

Suzuha: *Nodding, she seems lost in her own memories.* "I see... so the me of that attractor field went to the past too..."

Okabe: *I watch her, a faint smile flickering across her face, then replaced by a look of renewed intensity.*

Suzuha: *She takes a deep breath, steeling herself.* "Uncle Okarin. I know you don’t want to, but--"

Okabe: *I interrupt her, my voice firm, my determination unwavering.* "No. I won’t let Kurisu’s death be in vain. I won’t let Mayuri die."

Mayuri: *She blinks, confused and worried.* "Huh? Mayushii dies?"

Suzuha: *She focuses on me, a glint of determination in her eyes.* "By Kurisu, I assume you mean Makise Kurisu? Listen, Uncle. Let’s say -- hypothetically -- that the only way to change the future of this worldline is to go to July 28th, 2010, the day Makise Kurisu dies... ...and save her. What would you do?"

Okabe: *Shock ripples through my body, my heart pounding in my chest.* "What!?" *Save... Kurisu? But how? We no longer have the PhoneWave or the Time Leap Machine. And even if we did, I could never leap that far back.*

Okabe: *Then it hits me. Of course. I look over Suzuha’s shoulder, at the object disguised as a satellite.* "Ah...!" *My heart races as hope flares within me.* "Your time machine... We can use your time machine!" *I say, my voice filled with newfound determination.*
