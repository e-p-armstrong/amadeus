Okabe: *As the words tumbled out of Suzuha's mouth, I could feel my heart hammering in my chest, my mind racing to keep up with the enormity of what she was saying.* "Wha..."

Suzuha: *With a slight shrug, I meet Okabe's bewildered gaze with a look of resolve.* "I was told that Steins Gate is a brand new worldline, one no one has ever observed."

Itaru: *I scratch my head, my brows furrowing in confusion as I wrestle with the implications of Suzuha's words.* "But didn’t someone have to observe it to know it’s there?"

Suzuha: *I shake my head, a determined set to my jaw.* "Nope. It’s never been observed. That’s what makes it new. But Dad and Uncle Okarin were able to calculate its divergence. -0.081609% relative to the current worldline. That’s where we’ll find Steins Gate."

Okabe: *My hands ball into fists at my sides, a wave of desperation washing over me.* "And to reach that worldline, we have to save Kurisu?"

Suzuha: *I nod, my gaze steady.* "Exactly. She’s the key to averting World War Three. As long as she lives, the war won’t happen. Or at the very least, 5.7 billion people won’t die."

Okabe: *I stagger back, as if physically struck by the weight of her words.* "Why?"

Suzuha: *I blink, taken aback by his question.* "Huh?"

Okabe: *I grit my teeth, my voice rising in frustration.* "Why Kurisu? I mean, I know she’s a genius, but are you telling me she’s the hero who’ll save 5.7 billion people?"

Suzuha: *I pause, my gaze dropping to the floor as I grapple with the enormity of his question.* "...I don’t know."

Okabe: *I throw my hands up in exasperation, my voice echoing off the walls of the lab.* "You don’t know? And you expect me to go along with this!?"

Suzuha: *I raise my hands in a placating gesture, trying to keep the situation under control.* "Hey, I’m just following Dad’s plan. And apparently, you’re the one who came up with it in the first place. If there’s a flaw in your plan, then we’re all in trouble."

Okabe: *I lean forward, my gaze intense.* "It sounds like you didn’t hear it from me. Is that right?"

Suzuha: *I swallow hard, my eyes shining with a mix of sadness and determination.* "You passed away ten years ago -- 15 years from now, that is. The year 2025."

Okabe: *A chill runs down my spine, the cold reality of my own mortality hitting me like a punch to the gut.*

Suzuha: *I continue, my voice steady despite the heavy silence.* "So I don’t know the whole story. What I do know is that my dad continued your work. After you died, he built this time machine all by himself just to see your plan through."

Itaru: *I blink in surprise, my gaze drifting to the complex machinery of the time machine.*

Suzuha: *I clench my fists, my voice ringing out with conviction.* "Uncle Okarin. Like I said, Steins Gate is unobserved. Nobody knows what future awaits us there. There’s a chance that a dystopia rises from the ashes of World War Three. There’s a chance that Makise Kurisu dies just two days after you save her. There’s a chance that you don’t die in 2025, but next week. But there’s also a chance that when 2036 comes, there will be no dystopia, no world ravaged by war. There’s a chance that everyone, including Makise Kurisu, will still be alive. There’s a chance that a wonderful future awaits. At least it won’t be the future I came from. And it won’t be the future the other me came from. That much is certain."
