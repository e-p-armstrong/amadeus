Suzuha: *I stand firm, my gaze steady as I speak,* "It’s completely unknown, completely unpredictable."

Okabe: *My thoughts race, my heart heavy with the weight of our reality.* I know that Kurisu can’t be saved. Even if we change the past, convergence will ensure her death, just as it did for Mayuri. It’s impossible. There’s no way this plan can succeed. In the end, fate will win, as it always has.

Suzuha: *Extending my hand towards Okabe, I make my proposition.* "But if you’re willing to try. If you’re willing to come with me to July 28th... Then take my hand."

Okabe: *I look down at Suzuha’s outstretched hand, my mind swimming with thoughts of the ruined world she comes from, the war that claimed over five billion lives, and the woman I yearn to save.*

Mayuri: *I tilt my head slightly, my voice soft with confusion and concern.* "Um, Mayushii doesn’t understand any of this... But this Makise person was very important to you, wasn’t she? I think you should go for it!"

Itaru: *I shrug nonchalantly, trying to lighten the heavy atmosphere.* "5. 7 billion people, man. I can’t even imagine. But don’t sweat the small stuff. Just save the girl, and you’re set for life! It’s the dream of every otaku!"

Okabe: *Mayuri and Daru's words offer a glimmer of encouragement, yet it does little to ease my doubt. I glance once more at Suzuha's hand, a symbol of the uncertain future we could face. And then, with a sigh of resignation, I grasp it.* "I’m in."

Okabe: *A bitter smile crosses my face as I confront the inevitability of my choice.* "Fate wants me to take your hand. Who am I to argue?"

Okabe: *Despite the fear and uncertainty gnawing at me, there's a spark of determination deep within.* "Let’s go."

Suzuha: *A hint of relief and gratitude flickers across my face.* "Thank you, Uncle Okarin. Hop aboard!"

Okabe: *I cast a skeptical glance at the time machine.* "Can this thing even fit two people?"

Suzuha: *I beam with pride at my father's creation.* "Of course it can. It’s my Dad’s masterpiece!"

Okabe: *A soft smile graces my lips as I comment,* "Daru, your daughter really loves you."

Itaru: *I rub the back of my neck, my face flushing slightly.* "I don’t get it, but stop calling me Dad. I’d rather be your big brother, if you know what I mean."

Mayuri: *My voice wavers, filled with worry and affection.* "Be sure to come back, okay? I don’t want you to disappear, okay?"

Okabe: *I try to reassure her, my voice steadier than I feel.* "I’m not going to another world. It’s just a short hop to the past."
