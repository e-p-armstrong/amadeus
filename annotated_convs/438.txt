Suzuha: *I outstretch my hand towards Okabe, my gaze unwavering.* "Give me your phone."

Okabe: *I hesitantly place the device in her hand, my fingers lingering on it for a moment before I let go.*

Suzuha: *With a swift, casual motion, I toss the phone out of the hatch, the device tumbling into the void outside.*

Okabe: *I watch in shock as my phone disappears from sight, my voice echoing out in surprise.* "Hey!"

Suzuha: *I turn back to him, my expression stern.* "It’s better not to bring it. It’ll cause interference."

Okabe: *I blink, trying to process her words. So, we're going back to a time where another version of me exists. If I brought my phone, there would be two of them as well. I guess that could cause problems, especially if I received a call.*

Suzuha: *I glance at the open hatch, the wind whistling through the small opening.* "Shut the hatch."

Okabe: *I can hear Mayuri and Daru cheering outside, their voices muffled by the wind. I notice Mayuri catching my phone, her face lighting up in relief. After giving them a final nod, I pull the hatch shut, the noise abruptly silenced. Turning to Suzuha, I see her setting the time display panel. July 28, 2010. 11:50 AM.*

Suzuha: *I press the final button, a sense of satisfaction washing over me.* "That should do it."

Okabe: *I swallow hard, a knot forming in my stomach.* "That’s cutting it awfully close."

Suzuha: *I nod, my gaze never leaving the panel.* "This time machine can’t physically move."

Okabe: *I frown, trying to decipher her cryptic words.* "Meaning?"

Suzuha: *I turn to him, trying to simplify my explanation.* "No matter what time we travel to, we’ll always arrive at the exact same coordinates. In other words, on the roof of Radi-Kan. I mean, it’s a little more complicated than that, but there’s no time to explain. Anyway, we could leap to the day before the presentation. But if we attract too much attention, they could close Radi-Kan and cancel the presentation. That’s why we’ve gotta cut it close."

Okabe: *I nod, understanding dawning on me.* "I see..."

Suzuha: *I study him, trying to gauge his emotions.* "Uncle, this is your first time time traveling, right?"

Okabe: *I grimace at her words, my mind going back to my countless time leaps.* "Okay, first, stop calling me Uncle. And yes. I’ve made more time leaps than I want to remember, but I’ve never time traveled before. According to John Titor, the G-forces are pretty strong. You feel like you’re being stretched out."

Suzuha: *I chuckle softly, a small smile playing on my lips.* "Yeah, I wrote that."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a jolt of surprise running through me.* "The John Titor stuff?"

Suzuha: *I nod, my smile fading.* "Right. Back when I leapt to 2000."

Okabe: *I take a moment to process this, the past changing from my perspective. On this worldline, those posts were made to an English BBS in the year 2000.* "I see..."

Suzuha: *I scrutinize him, trying to gauge his reaction.* "You don’t sound surprised."

Okabe: *Nothing can surprise me now. My mind is a whirlwind of thoughts and information, threatening to burst at any moment.*

Suzuha: *I take a deep breath, preparing myself for the mission ahead.* "I’ll go over the mission one more time. Once we arrive, there’ll be no time for chitchat. The objective is to prevent Makise Kurisu’s death."
