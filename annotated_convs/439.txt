Suzuha: *I lean back, my hands clasped together as if I'm praying, a deep sigh escaping my lips.* "That day’s a turning point, remember?" *I fix my gaze on Okabe, hoping to see understanding in his eyes.* "Meaning the probability of Makise Kurisu’s death is roughly 50%."

Okabe: *I swallow hard, feeling a knot of worry in my throat.* "So convergence won’t happen?"

Suzuha: *I shake my head, my expression grave.* "It may happen, it may not. No, it probably will." *I pause, trying to find the right words.* "But I’m sure there’s a loophole somewhere. That loophole is the doorway to Steins Gate."

As Suzuha mentions the loophole, *a flicker of hope ignites within me. It feels like a gamble, but it's the only chance we've got.*

Suzuha: *I sit up straighter, a note of caution in my voice.* "Oh, one more thing. Watch out for Doctor Nakabachi."

Okabe: *I furrow my brow, puzzled.* "What do you mean?"

Suzuha: *I close my eyes for a moment, collecting my thoughts.* "Remember what I said about World War Three? It all started because of something called the Nakabachi Paper, a paper Doctor Nakabachi wrote detailing his theory of time travel."

Okabe: *I scoff, my voice tinged with disdain.* "But that fraud’s theory was just a ripoff of John Titor’s."

As I say this, *a realization hits me like a bolt of lightning. I'm talking to John Titor. Everything suddenly starts to make sense.*

Okabe: *I stare at Suzuha, my eyes wide with surprise.* "So what Titor posted on the internet was true?"

Suzuha: *I nod, a slight smile playing on my lips.* "I mixed in some lies, so not many people listened to me at the time. I never thought someone would reevaluate it ten years later. Looks like he built his theory off what I wrote. Apparently, it’s almost perfect. Anyway, Doctor Nakabachi was there when Makise Kurisu was killed, right? So watch out for him. I’m sure he’s important to the divergence of this worldline."

*My mind reels at this revelation. Doctor Nakabachi, a con artist, was important? It's hard to believe.*

Suzuha: *I stand up, dusting off my pants.* "Ready to go? Fasten your seatbelt."

*I look underneath my butt to find what looks like a car seatbelt. I wrap it around my waist and fix my body to the seat.*

Okabe: *I gulp, my voice shaky.* "Does it shake a lot?"

Suzuha: *She chuckles, shaking her head.* "Shake? No, it doesn’t shake."

*I feel a knot of fear in my stomach. If it doesn't shake, then what does it do? Is this even safe?*

Suzuha: *I lean forward and push a bright yellow button on the bottom of the panel.* "It’s only three weeks, so it shouldn’t take more than two or three minutes."

*Suzuha fastens her own seatbelt and sighs, as if she's been through this many times before.*

Suzuha: "When I first leapt to 1975, it was six long hours with nothing to do."

*Time travelers have their own problems, I guess.*

Suzuha: "Since it’s only a few minutes, we won’t bother with the oxygen masks. Just be aware we’ll have no oxygen for the duration."

Okabe: *I gasp, my heart pounding in my chest.* "You mean I have to hold my breath!?"

Suzuha: "Right here..." *She points to the center of the cylinder -- the space between me and her.* "There’ll be an air pocket. Stick your head inside, and you’ll have enough oxygen for about ten minutes."

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, my mind filled with worst-case scenarios.* "Hey. For argument’s sake... what happens if we fail to save Kurisu?"

Suzuha: *She looks at me, her eyes filled with determination.* "There’s not much fuel left. We barely had enough to begin with. There’s not even enough for a return trip to 2036. So if we fail to change the worldline, then I’ll be stuck in this time. But don’t worry. As long as we’re just traveling three weeks each way, we still have enough for two round trips."
