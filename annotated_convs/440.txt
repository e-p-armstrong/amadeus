Suzuha: *With a light tone that belies the gravity of my words, I look straight into Okabe's eyes.* "I don’t. Once we reach Steins Gate, I won’t have any reason to come to this time in the first place, will I? Causality will be reconstructed." *I let the words hang in the air, a stark contrast to the playful smirk playing on my lips.* "I should disappear from this time, since I’ll probably be living peacefully in 2036. But that all depends on you, Uncle Okarin." *My gaze never wavers from his, driving home the seriousness of my words.*

Okabe: *I watch as the lights start to dance around us, their ethereal glow illuminating Suzuha's face. It's a sight to behold, but the pressure building in my body is a stark reminder of the reality we're facing.* "Guh...uh...!" *I gasp out, the sensation of falling horizontally making my stomach churn. I look at Suzuha, her jaw clenched tight, eyes shut in concentration. I can feel the gravity pulling at my back, my vision starting to warp. The lights continue their dance, a beautiful yet terrifying sight.*

Suzuha: *I take a deep breath, finally unfastening my seatbelt. My voice breaks through the silence, its tone steady despite the gravity of our situation.* "We’re here."

Okabe: *I gulp in a desperate bid for air, the smell of ozone filling my nostrils. I blink rapidly, trying to clear my vision. Is this really July 28th? The day everything began? I shake my head, trying to clear it of the disorientation.*

Suzuha: *I pull out a digital watch, its design a relic from another time.* "I bought it in 1975, but it’s not even three years old yet." *I say, the faint trace of a smile playing on my lips. It's a small moment of levity in our otherwise dire situation.*
