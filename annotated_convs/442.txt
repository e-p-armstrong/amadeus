Okabe: *My eyes widen, my heart aches.* "Kurisu...!"

Kurisu: *I blink, surprised.* "Um, do I know you?"

Okabe: *I choke back a sob, my voice barely a whisper.* "No..."

Kurisu: *I furrow my brows, trying to make sense of his strange behaviour.* "You came down from the roof just now, didn’t you?"

Okabe: *I gaze at her, unable to tear my eyes away from her beautiful face. The sight of her is overwhelming, bringing forth a flood of memories and emotions. My throat tightens, and I struggle to hold back the tears threatening to spill over.* 

Kurisu: *I press on, despite his strange silence.* "I heard a strange sound from the roof. Is that why the building shook just now? What’s going on? It’s not Doctor Nakabachi’s doing, is it?"

Okabe: *I swallow hard, the lump in my throat making it difficult to breathe, let alone speak. My mind races, desperate for a solution. I can't afford to let my emotions get the better of me. Not now.*

Kurisu: *I narrow my eyes, growing increasingly worried by his silence.* "Are you listening? You’re sweating like crazy."

Okabe: *I can feel her gaze on me, but I can't bring myself to meet it. My hand trembles as I reach towards her, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Kurisu: *I recoil, startled.* "Hey!"

Okabe: *I pull my hand back, realizing how I must appear. My heart aches, but I force myself to turn away, to leave her behind.*

Kurisu: *I call after him, my voice echoing in the empty hallway.* "Please answer my question!"

Okabe: *I pause, turning back to face her. My heart aches with the need to tell her everything, but I know I can't. All I can do is hope.*

Kurisu: *I stare at him, my confusion growing.* "...Answer me."

Okabe: *My voice catches in my throat.* "Can I--"

Kurisu: *I tilt my head, trying to understand.* "Can you... what?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, the weight of my mission crashing down on me. I turn and bolt for the stairs, leaving Kurisu behind.*

Kurisu: *I reach out, calling after him.* "W-wait! Stop!"

Okabe: *I pause at the top of the stairs, my heart pounding. I glance back at the assembly hall, my resolve hardened.* "Who the hell am I!? Someone who knows you for a fraud, that’s who!"
