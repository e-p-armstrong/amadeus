Planning:

Characters:

Okabe - He's the protagonist and a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He's currently in a lot of emotional turmoil, having just travelled back in time to a point before Kurisu's death. He's trying to act casual and play off his love for Kurisu as if they're meeting for the first time, but it's tearing him up inside.

Kurisu - She's a genius neuroscientist who is also a bit socially awkward. She's meeting Okabe for the "first" time in this scene and is confused and a bit scared by his intense emotion.

Writing Styles:

Okabe - His actions and thoughts will be intense, dramatic, and a bit erratic, reflecting his emotional state. He's trying to hold back his feelings for Kurisu, so his actions will be restrained but his thoughts will be full of emotion.

Kurisu - Her actions will be cautious and analytical, reflecting her scientific mind. She's trying to understand Okabe's strange behaviour, so her dialogue will be questioning and a bit suspicious.

Anchor Lines:
1. Okabe: "Kurisu...!" - This line will be an anchor, carrying the weight of Okabe's emotional turmoil and his shock at seeing Kurisu alive again.
2. Kurisu: "Are you listening? You’re sweating like crazy." - This line will be the other anchor, showing Kurisu's confusion and growing suspicion about Okabe's behaviour.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *My eyes widen, my heart aches.* "Kurisu...!"

Kurisu: *I blink, surprised.* "Um, do I know you?"

Okabe: *I choke back a sob, my voice barely a whisper.* "No..."

Kurisu: *I furrow my brows, trying to make sense of his strange behaviour.* "You came down from the roof just now, didn’t you?"

Okabe: *I gaze at her, unable to tear my eyes away from her beautiful face. The sight of her is overwhelming, bringing forth a flood of memories and emotions. My throat tightens, and I struggle to hold back the tears threatening to spill over.* 

Kurisu: *I press on, despite his strange silence.* "I heard a strange sound from the roof. Is that why the building shook just now? What’s going on? It’s not Doctor Nakabachi’s doing, is it?"

Okabe: *I swallow hard, the lump in my throat making it difficult to breathe, let alone speak. My mind races, desperate for a solution. I can't afford to let my emotions get the better of me. Not now.*

Kurisu: *I narrow my eyes, growing increasingly worried by his silence.* "Are you listening? You’re sweating like crazy."

Okabe: *I can feel her gaze on me, but I can't bring myself to meet it. My hand trembles as I reach towards her, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Kurisu: *I recoil, startled.* "Hey!"

Okabe: *I pull my hand back, realizing how I must appear. My heart aches, but I force myself to turn away, to leave her behind.*

Kurisu: *I call after him, my voice echoing in the empty hallway.* "Please answer my question!"

Okabe: *I pause, turning back to face her. My heart aches with the need to tell her everything, but I know I can't. All I can do is hope.*

Kurisu: *I stare at him, my confusion growing.* "...Answer me."

Okabe: *My voice catches in my throat.* "Can I--"

Kurisu: *I tilt my head, trying to understand.* "Can you... what?"

Okabe: *I shake my head, the weight of my mission crashing down on me. I turn and bolt for the stairs, leaving Kurisu behind.*

Kurisu: *I reach out, calling after him.* "W-wait! Stop!"

Okabe: *I pause at the top of the stairs, my heart pounding. I glance back at the assembly hall, my resolve hardened.* "Who the hell am I!? Someone who knows you for a fraud, that’s who!"
