Okabe: *My heart hammers in my chest, my thoughts racing.* "...!?" *I slap a hand over my mouth, stifling the gasp of surprise that nearly escapes.*

Suzuha: *Her gaze hardens, a grim seriousness overtaking her usual cheerfulness.* "Oh, one more thing. Watch out for Doctor Nakabachi."

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my thoughts spiraling. I look at Kurisu, a sense of dread settling in my gut as I realize the potential danger.* 

Kurisu: *Her voice trembles slightly, but there's a firm determination in her eyes.* "Are you listening, Papa?"

Okabe: *I feel a cold shiver run down my spine. I watch, my mind racing, as the pieces fall into place.* 

Nakabachi: *He looks at Kurisu with a sneer, his eyes narrowing in suspicion.* "What is that?"

Kurisu: *She takes a deep breath, gathering her courage.* "I heard you were giving a presentation on time travel. So I thought about it too. Could it be possible to make a time machine?"

Okabe: *I stare at Kurisu in shock, my mind reeling. I remember her vehement denial of time travel at ATF, and yet, here she was, presenting a thesis on the very same topic.*

Kurisu: *Her gaze is pleading, almost desperate.* "I’d like your opinion, Papa. We can polish it together, then submit it to the scientific community. I don’t know if they’ll listen, but just in case, I do have acquaintances at Science Magazine."

Okabe: *I watch as Nakabachi starts reading the document with a disgusted frown. My mind races, the implications of this revelation hitting me with full force.*

Suzuha: *She speaks with urgency, her words heavy with the weight of the future.* "It started with a race between the EU and Russia. Then America got involved, and things really went to hell."

Okabe: *I feel a cold dread settle in my stomach. My eyes dart between Nakabachi and Kurisu, my mind piecing together the dire consequences.*

Nakabachi: *He snaps at Kurisu, his voice harsh and dismissive.* "Did I ask you to write this?"

Kurisu: *She stammers, her eyes wide with shock and hurt.* "Well... no, but... You invited me to come, remember? It was the first time we’d talked in seven years. That’s what got me thinking. And as I worked on the thesis, I started to realize it might actually be possible to build a time machine.  If the thesis is published, you could have your revenge on the scientific community for shunning you--"
