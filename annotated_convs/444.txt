Kurisu: *I swallow hard, my voice trembling as I confront the man in front of me.* "You’re... stealing it, Papa?"

Nakabachi: *I blink, taken aback by her accusation.* "...What did you say?"

Kurisu: *I gather my courage, taking a step forward and locking eyes with him.* "You’re stealing my work? I didn’t think even you would do something like-- Ah!"

Nakabachi: *I spin around, my palm connecting with her cheek with a loud smack.* "Who do you think you’re talking to!?" *With a flick of my wrist, I discard the paper, its contents meaningless to me. My hand closes around Kurisu's throat, squeezing until her gasps fill the room.*

Kurisu: *I choke, my fingers clawing at the hand around my neck.* "Ah, guh..."

Nakabachi: *I shake her, my voice rising in pitch with each word.* "You can’t possibly understand how I feel! Why did you have to be so talented!? I detest you! I hate your very existence! Nobody is allowed to be better than me! Understand!? Nobody! Especially not my own daughter! That’s why I sent you away! I couldn’t bear the shame of being your father! It’s all your fault! It’s all your fault!"

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest as I watch the scene unfold, every fibre of my being screaming at me to intervene. I push off from my hiding spot, charging towards the man with a roar.* "Stop!"

Nakabachi: *I stagger back, caught off guard by the sudden intrusion.* "...!?"

Okabe: *I collide with him, my shoulder driving into his chest and sending him sprawling. I turn to Kurisu, her gasping breaths echoing in my ears.* "Guh, gah hoh gah hoh gah hoh..."

Nakabachi: *I scramble to my feet, my eyes narrowing at the intruder.* "Who the hell are you!?"

Okabe: *I stand tall, my eyes blazing with determination.* "I won’t let you kill Kurisu!"
