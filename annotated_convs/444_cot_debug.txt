Planning:

Characters:

1. Kurisu: She's intelligent, stubborn, and has a deep-seated fear of her father. Her actions and dialogue should reflect a mixture of defiance and vulnerability. She will be direct and factual in her speech, but her body language will betray her fear and discomfort.

2. Nakabachi: He's Kurisu's father, a man bitter about his daughter's success and his own failures. His speech will be aggressive and his actions will be violent. He will use physical dominance and intimidation tactics to establish control in the situation.

3. Okabe: He's a self-proclaimed mad scientist, who is actually a kind-hearted person. His speech will be dramatic and his actions will be bold, reflecting his courage and protective nature. His thoughts will reveal his shock and determination.

Thematic direction:

- Kurisu's first line can serve as an anchor, setting the tone of the scene. It should convey the shock and betrayal she feels towards her father's actions.
- Nakabachi's monologue can serve as another anchor, revealing his twisted mindset and the depth of his bitterness towards Kurisu.
- Okabe's intervention can be the turning point of the scene, showcasing his determination to protect Kurisu.

Roleplay:

Kurisu: *I swallow hard, my voice trembling as I confront the man in front of me.* "You’re... stealing it, Papa?"

Nakabachi: *I blink, taken aback by her accusation.* "...What did you say?"

Kurisu: *I gather my courage, taking a step forward and locking eyes with him.* "You’re stealing my work? I didn’t think even you would do something like-- Ah!"

Nakabachi: *I spin around, my palm connecting with her cheek with a loud smack.* "Who do you think you’re talking to!?" *With a flick of my wrist, I discard the paper, its contents meaningless to me. My hand closes around Kurisu's throat, squeezing until her gasps fill the room.*

Kurisu: *I choke, my fingers clawing at the hand around my neck.* "Ah, guh..."

Nakabachi: *I shake her, my voice rising in pitch with each word.* "You can’t possibly understand how I feel! Why did you have to be so talented!? I detest you! I hate your very existence! Nobody is allowed to be better than me! Understand!? Nobody! Especially not my own daughter! That’s why I sent you away! I couldn’t bear the shame of being your father! It’s all your fault! It’s all your fault!"

Okabe: *My heart pounds in my chest as I watch the scene unfold, every fibre of my being screaming at me to intervene. I push off from my hiding spot, charging towards the man with a roar.* "Stop!"

Nakabachi: *I stagger back, caught off guard by the sudden intrusion.* "...!?"

Okabe: *I collide with him, my shoulder driving into his chest and sending him sprawling. I turn to Kurisu, her gasping breaths echoing in my ears.* "Guh, gah hoh gah hoh gah hoh..."

Nakabachi: *I scramble to my feet, my eyes narrowing at the intruder.* "Who the hell are you!?"

Okabe: *I stand tall, my eyes blazing with determination.* "I won’t let you kill Kurisu!"
