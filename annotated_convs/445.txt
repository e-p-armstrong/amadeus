Okabe: *I instinctively dodge back, a cold rush of adrenaline coursing through my veins.* "...Kuh!" *The knife whizzes past my face, missing by a hair's breadth. I can almost feel the murderous intent radiating from him, it fills me with terror, but I can't let it consume me. I can't die here. I can't let Kurisu die.*

Nakabachi: *His voice is a harsh snarl, his face twisted in madness.* "Apologize!"

Okabe: *I swallow hard, feeling the fear clawing at my throat.* "Gh--" *But I can't back down now. With a surge of determination, I throw myself forward, knocking Nakabachi’s hand aside. The knife clatters to the floor, gleaming ominously in the dim light. I snatch it up, my hands trembling slightly.*

Kurisu: *Her voice is desperate, filled with fear and pleading.* "Stop it, Papa!"

Okabe: "NAKABACHI!" *I thrust the knife towards his unprotected back, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Kurisu: "NO!" *Her voice is a desperate scream, filled with terror and... guilt?*

Okabe: *My hand meets resistance, the sensation of tearing through flesh sends a shudder down my spine.* "wh...y..." *But it's not Nakabachi I've stabbed. It's Kurisu. Her eyes are wide with shock and pain, her mouth opening and closing as she gasps for breath.*

Okabe: *I can't comprehend what's just happened. Kurisu, the one I was trying to save, is bleeding in my arms.* "Why..."
