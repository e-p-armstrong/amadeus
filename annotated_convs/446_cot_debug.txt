Planning:
- Okabe: As the protagonist and the one narrating the scene, his actions are filled with despair and horror. His thoughts will be frantic and scattered, reflecting his shock and inability to process the situation.
- Kurisu: With her dying breaths, she is surprisingly calm and accepting. Her actions will be weak and fading, reflecting her dwindling life force.
- Suzuha: As a time traveler, she is both empathetic and pragmatic. Her actions will be swift and decisive, reflecting her understanding of the situation and the need to act quickly.
- Nakabachi: He is Kurisu's father, but his actions are cold and heartless. His actions will be callous and quick, reflecting his cowardly nature.

Anchors:
- Kurisu: "Because... he’s still... my father. I just... wanted him... to accept me..." - This line is important because it reveals Kurisu's inner turmoil and her unfulfilled desire for her father's approval.
- Okabe: "Ah... ah... AHHHHHHHHHHH!" - This line is the climax of Okabe's despair and realization of what he has done.

Roleplay:

Nakabachi: *With a hideous, triumphant laughter, I snatch up the fallen thesis, clutching it like a prized possession. My heart pounding in my chest, I dart towards the distant elevator, leaving behind the horror I've created.* 

Okabe: *I stand frozen, my feet rooted to the ground as if nailed to the floor. The reality of the situation looms before me, yet I'm paralyzed, unable to act.* "Is this a sick joke? I...I just wanted to know who..."

Kurisu: *My voice, weak and shaky, barely rises above a whisper.* "I’m... sorry..."

Okabe: *Something wet seeps into my hands, warm and viscous. It's Kurisu's blood, gushing from her wound like a broken faucet. I try to pull away the knife, hoping to stop the flow, but my hands... they won't budge. It's as if I've turned to stone.*

Kurisu: *I gasp for breath, each intake becoming more and more laborious.* "Haah... haah..."

Okabe: *I can feel her body convulsing against mine, her pain resonating through me. Despair engulfs me as my body refuses to obey my commands. I need to help her, but how? I feel a lump forming in my throat, my vision blurring with unshed tears.* "Why..."

Kurisu: *Each word takes a tremendous effort, yet I force them out, wanting to make myself understood.* "Because... he’s still... my father. I just... wanted him... to accept me... I studied... so hard... hoping he would... praise me... But now... I finally... understand... Papa... didn’t want... to accept me... I’m such... an idiot... Why... did I save him... I wonder... I’m... sorry... for getting you... involved... Ugh... it hurts... Am I... going to die? I don’t want to die... I don’t want it... to end... like this..."

Okabe: *Her voice grows fainter with each passing second, and I'm desperate. I want to scream, to call for help, but my voice is stuck in my throat.* 

Kurisu: *My body feels heavy, my strength rapidly depleting.* "Help... me... He...lp..."

Okabe: *Her lifeless body weighs heavy in my arms, and an eerie silence fills the room. But the warmth of her blood lingers, a cruel reminder of what I've done. I... I killed her.* "Ah... ah... AHHHHHHHHHHH!"

Suzuha: *I rush to Okabe's side, grabbing his arm.* "Uncle Okarin!"

Suzuha: *Without waiting for a response, I slip my hands under his shoulders, hauling him up with all my strength.* "Come on! Get up!"

Okabe: *The knife slips out from Kurisu's chest, unleashing a fresh wave of crimson. The warmth of her blood is still there, searing into my skin.* "Open your eyes, Kurisu... Wake up..."
