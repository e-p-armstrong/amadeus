Okabe: *I swallow hard, my voice coming out as a hoarse whisper, filled with a pain so deep it feels like it's tearing me apart.* "I’m sorry... I didn’t mean to kill you... I tried to save you... I did... Why is this happening..."

Suzuha: *Suddenly, I feel a strong arm around me, pulling me up.* "Hup! Phew... let’s get outta here... Don’t give up yet, Uncle. Everything’s gonna be fine. I promise! Now hold on tight!" *She says, her voice firm and encouraging, despite the despair surrounding us.*

Itaru: "Woah, you’re already back! It hasn’t even been a minute." *He exclaims, his voice filled with surprise and confusion.*

Mayuri: *She rushes over to me, her eyes wide with concern.* "...Okarin? Okarin!"

Itaru: "Whoa, you’re covered in blood! What happened!?" *He cries out, his voice filled with panic.*

Suzuha: "Get him a towel, Dad! And water! And some clothes, too! Hurry!" *She commands, her voice urgent.*

Itaru: "Eh? Eh? An explanation, por favor!" *He asks, flustered.*

Suzuha: "Just go already!" *She snaps, her patience wearing thin.*

Itaru: "O-okay!" *He stammers, quickly running off.*

Mayuri: *She kneels down beside me, her hands trembling.* "Are you okay? Hang in there... don’t die..."

Suzuha: "He’s okay. It’s not his blood." *She reassures her, her voice steady despite the situation.*

Okabe: *I let out a bitter laugh, my voice echoing in the empty street.* "There’s no way to save her... there never was... Hahaha... Everything has already been decided... It’s the same as it was with Mayuri. The same... No matter how hard I struggle... the result will always be the same..."

Okabe: *I feel my body sagging, my mind filled with a despair so deep it feels like I'm drowning in it.* "There’s nothing I can do... nothing... nothing... I can’t save Kurisu after all... ha, haha, hahaha... I knew this would happen... I knew it would turn out like this... I can’t take this any more... I’m so tired... enough already... I give up... Haha, ha..."
