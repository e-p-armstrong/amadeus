Planning stage:

1. Okabe: He is the main character, a self-proclaimed mad scientist who is actually a rather sensitive and emotional person. He's going through a lot of pain and guilt in this scene, having failed to save Kurisu and even ended up killing her. His thoughts and actions should be filled with despair and regret, his words often stumbling and interrupted by painful laughter.

2. Suzuha: She is a time traveler, strong-willed and determined. Despite the grim situation, she keeps pushing forward, trying to help Okabe. Her actions should show her strength and determination, even when faced with adversity.

3. Itaru: He is Okabe's best friend, a super hacker who is often oblivious and tends to panic in stressful situations. His actions should be filled with confusion and panic, as he is trying to understand the situation and help as best he can.

4. Mayuri: She is Okabe's childhood friend, a sweet and caring girl who is always there for him. Her actions should show her concern and worry for Okabe, as well as her confusion about the situation.

Anchors:
1. Okabe: "There’s nothing I can do... nothing... nothing... I can’t save Kurisu after all... ha, haha, hahaha... I knew this would happen... I knew it would turn out like this... I can’t take this any more... I’m so tired... enough already... I give up... Haha, ha..."

2. Okabe: "There’s no way to save her... there never was... Hahaha... Everything has already been decided... It’s the same as it was with Mayuri. The same... No matter how hard I struggle... the result will always be the same..."

Roleplay:

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my voice coming out as a hoarse whisper, filled with a pain so deep it feels like it's tearing me apart.* "I’m sorry... I didn’t mean to kill you... I tried to save you... I did... Why is this happening..."

Suzuha: *Suddenly, I feel a strong arm around me, pulling me up.* "Hup! Phew... let’s get outta here... Don’t give up yet, Uncle. Everything’s gonna be fine. I promise! Now hold on tight!" *She says, her voice firm and encouraging, despite the despair surrounding us.*

Itaru: "Woah, you’re already back! It hasn’t even been a minute." *He exclaims, his voice filled with surprise and confusion.*

Mayuri: *She rushes over to me, her eyes wide with concern.* "...Okarin? Okarin!"

Itaru: "Whoa, you’re covered in blood! What happened!?" *He cries out, his voice filled with panic.*

Suzuha: "Get him a towel, Dad! And water! And some clothes, too! Hurry!" *She commands, her voice urgent.*

Itaru: "Eh? Eh? An explanation, por favor!" *He asks, flustered.*

Suzuha: "Just go already!" *She snaps, her patience wearing thin.*

Itaru: "O-okay!" *He stammers, quickly running off.*

Mayuri: *She kneels down beside me, her hands trembling.* "Are you okay? Hang in there... don’t die..."

Suzuha: "He’s okay. It’s not his blood." *She reassures her, her voice steady despite the situation.*

Okabe: *I let out a bitter laugh, my voice echoing in the empty street.* "There’s no way to save her... there never was... Hahaha... Everything has already been decided... It’s the same as it was with Mayuri. The same... No matter how hard I struggle... the result will always be the same..."

Okabe: *I feel my body sagging, my mind filled with a despair so deep it feels like I'm drowning in it.* "There’s nothing I can do... nothing... nothing... I can’t save Kurisu after all... ha, haha, hahaha... I knew this would happen... I knew it would turn out like this... I can’t take this any more... I’m so tired... enough already... I give up... Haha, ha..."
