Roleplay:

Okabe: *A sudden, burning numbness spreads through my cheek. I touch my face in disbelief, still processing the slap I've just received from Mayuri.* "Wha..."

Mayuri: *I look at Okabe, tears streaming down my face. My small body gently embraces his, not minding the blood that stains his clothes.* "Okarin... you’re not a quitter. Mayushii knows. You never, ever give up. Not until the very end. Remember? Every day, Mayushii prayed for help in front of Granny’s grave. And every day, you came to see me. Even on rainy days and snowy days, you always stood next to Mayushii and called my name. Because you were always there for Mayushii... I was finally able to say goodbye to Granny. Mayushii doesn’t really understand what’s going on, but don’t give up now. Okay? Mayushii doesn’t want to see you sad."

Okabe: *I feel Mayuri's gentle warmth enveloping me, her words resounding in my ears. But it's not enough. The guilt is too much. I find myself whispering into the silence.* "But... I killed her." *The words hang heavy in the air. The person most precious to me, who I wanted so desperately to save.* "I... killed her!"

Mayuri: "Okarin..." *I say, my voice barely a whisper.*

Okabe: *I can still feel the knife in my hand. I can still feel her fading heartbeat. I look at my hands over Mayuri’s shoulder. They’re red with blood. Kurisu’s blood. The shaking won’t stop. Tears fall, washing away the blood. Guilt and despair are tearing my soul. This reality is too much to bear. I feel myself crumbling under the weight of it.* "There’s nothing I can do..."

Suzuha: *I interrupt Okabe's despair, my voice full of conviction.* "You’re wrong."

Mayuri: *I take Okabe's phone out of my pocket, having been looking after it, and hand it to him.* "You’ve got mail, Okarin..."

Okabe: *I look at the phone in my hand, my eyes scanning the screen. I reluctantly open my inbox. A strange message. Who could it be from at a time like this? And then, I see the send time.* "2025..."
