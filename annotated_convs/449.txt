Suzuha: *My eyes dart to Okabe, catching his bewildered gaze. I glance at his phone, a surge of surprise washing over me.* "It actually came through! Just like he said it would!" *My voice echoes in the silent room, the weight of the message sinking in.*

Okabe: *I squint at Suzuha, trying to decipher her cryptic words. The confusion in her eyes mirrors my own, a reflection of the mystery shrouding us. She's from 2036, eleven years after this D-Mail was sent. Could it be unrelated to her?*

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, a frown tugging at my lips.* "What does it mean?" *I ask, my voice filled with innocent curiosity.*

Suzuha: *I straighten up, my gaze fixed on Okabe.* "There must be something on. Something you need to see!" *My voice carries a sense of urgency, knowing that every second counts.*

Itaru: *I saunter in, my arms laden with a convenience store bag.* "Hey, guys! I brought the stuff!" *I announce, oblivious to the tension in the room.*

Okabe: *I glance at Daru, a sigh of relief escaping my lips. His timing is impeccable. With my phone in hand, I flip to the TV reception. A news reporter comes into view, standing in a foreign airport with a jumbo jet in the background. The charred tail of the plane sends a chill down my spine. The headline screams "Fire on Russian Airlines".*

Female Reporter: "Russian authorities announced today that a fire broke out on Russian Airlines Flight 801, en route from Narita to Moscow. The flight departed Narita Airport at 11:05 Japan time, but a fire broke out in the cargo hold shortly before arrival. The flight made an emergency landing at Domodedovo International Airport, where the passengers were evacuated. No one was injured. One of the passengers on Flight 801 was a Japanese physicist who had declared his intention to seek asylum in Russia."

Okabe: *I hold my breath as the screen flickers to the airport lobby. A man, surrounded by reporters, comes into view. His face triggers a memory, a name. The realization hits me like a punch to the gut, my heart pounding in my chest.* "Doctor Nakabachi!"
