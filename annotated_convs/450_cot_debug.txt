Roleplay:
Mayuri: *I let out a startled yelp, my eyes wide as saucers as I point at the screen.* "AHHH!"
Okabe: *I follow her trembling finger to the screen, my eyes narrowing at the lump of metal in Nakabachi's hand. It's not just any lump of metal.* 
Mayuri: "That's my Metal Upa! Look! See there? It has Mayushii's name on it!" *I exclaim, my voice filled with a mixture of excitement and confusion.*
Okabe: *I take a closer look, my heart pounding in my chest. The letters read... Mayushii's!* 
Itaru: *I lean forward, squinting at the screen.* "Whoa, you're right! What's he doing with it?"
Mayuri: *I slump in my chair, a look of disappointment on my face.* "I dropped it during the presentation! I looked everywhere, but couldn't find it. So that's where it went! I can't get it back if it's all the way in Russia..."
Okabe: *I stare at the screen in disbelief, my body shaking. Goosebumps break out over every inch of flesh. I know what this is.* "The Butterfly Effect!"
Okabe: *My mind races back to that day, three weeks ago. That tiny figure, a mere child’s toy, had gone on to decide the fate of mankind. It rescued the Nakabachi Paper from the fire. And in so doing, it laid the foundation for World War Three.* 
Okabe: *I turn to Suzuha, my voice shaking.* "Suzuha... did you know about this?"
Suzuha: *I meet his gaze, a look of apology in my eyes.*
Okabe: *A chill runs down my spine as I ask,* "Who sent that D-Mail from 2025?"
Okabe: *Whoever it was, they clearly wanted us to see the news about Doctor Nakabachi.*
Suzuha: *I lower my gaze, my voice barely a whisper.* "Sorry."
Okabe: *Sorry? About what? What is she apologizing for?*
Suzuha: *I swallow hard, my voice filled with regret.* "Sorry for not telling you everything. But we needed you to fail once. You had to experience Makise Kurisu’s death firsthand."
Okabe: *I feel like I've been punched in the gut. My voice comes out as a harsh whisper.* "You... tricked me?"
Suzuha: *I shake my head, trying to find the right words.* "Not exactly. It was part of the plan. At least, that’s what I was told."
Okabe: *Told? By whom?*
Suzuha: "I’m sorry for making you go through that, Uncle." *I say, my voice barely audible.*
Okabe: *I demand, my voice shaking with suppressed anger,* "Tell me what’s going on."
Suzuha: *I point to the phone in his hand, my heart pounding in my chest.* "See for yourself."
Suzuha: "Then you’ll understand." *I add, hoping that he'll find the answers he's looking for.*
Okabe: *I frown, confusion and anger warring within me.* "What are you talking about?"
Suzuha: "The message should already be in your phone. The message you sent from 2025." *I say, my voice steady despite the tension in the room.*
Okabe: "...What?" *I blurt out, my mind struggling to comprehend what she's saying.*
Suzuha: "A video mail. You received one, didn’t you?" *I ask, my gaze fixed on him.*
Okabe: *I let out a soft gasp of realization. She’s right. When was that again? July 28th. Right after I met Kurisu for the first time. Just as I was about to contact Mayuri, I received a mysterious video mail from an address I had never seen before. Is that what she’s talking about?* "Ah...!"
Okabe: "But there was nothing on it. Just noise." *I object, my heart pounding in my chest.*
Suzuha: *I meet his gaze, my voice steady and confident.* "Try again."
