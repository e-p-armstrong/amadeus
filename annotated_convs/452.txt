Okabe: *Laughter wells up from deep within me, an absurd, almost hysterical sound that reverberates around the room.* "Heh... heh heh heh..." *My hands tremble slightly as I clutch at my lab coat, a manic glint in my eyes.* "Heh heh heh, hehehehe..."

Okabe: *I scoff at the thought that crosses my mind.* "I’m thirty-three years old and I still have no shame? Deceive myself? Deceive the world? That’s such chuuni bullshit!" *Despite my words, a strange sense of conviction settles in my heart.*

Okabe: *I straighten up, my chest heaving with the force of my laughter.* "Very well! If this is the choice of Steins Gate, then so be it! I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma! Deceiving the world is child’s play! It looks like I have to change the world after all! MUHAHAHAHA!"

Itaru: *I scratch my head, a bemused smile on my face.* "Whoa! I thought Okarin was finally turning serious, but now he’s back to his usual antics."

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes sparkling with pure joy.* "But you know, Mayushii likes Okarin better this way♪"

Itaru: *I chuckle, agreeing with Mayuri's sentiment.* "Yeah, I know what you mean. Okarin just isn’t Okarin unless he’s laughing like an idiot."

Mayuri: *I look towards Okabe with unwavering faith.* "Hououin Kyouma saved Mayushii, you know. So this time, he’ll definitely save Makise Kurisu!"

Itaru: *I raise an eyebrow, skepticism clear in my voice.* "But ’deceive the world’? What’s that supposed to mean?"

Mayuri: *I tilt my head, my brow furrowing in confusion.* "Ummm... Mayushii doesn’t have a clue..."

Okabe: *I smirk, confident in my plan.* "Heh heh heh... Isn’t it obvious? The only established fact about the past is that I saw Kurisu lying in a pool of blood. That’s the extent of my observation. Kurisu was lying in a pool of blood. As for whether she was alive or dead... That’s still open to interpretation."

Mayuri: *I blink in surprise, not entirely following Okabe's words.* "Huh?"

Okabe: *I lean back, spinning my own twisted version of the past.* "For example, just think of it like this. Kurisu was merely unconscious, and the blood was just a coat of red paint."

Mayuri: *My eyes widen in realization.* "Oh! Is that what happened?"

Itaru: *I frown, trying to reconcile Okabe's words with reality.* "Wait a second. The news reports all said that she was--"

Suzuha: *I interject, my tone stern.* "What’s true now doesn’t matter. Only what Uncle Okarin saw on July 28th matters."

Okabe: *I nod, a fierce determination in my eyes.* "What I’m going to do is recreate what I saw, and only what I saw. But this time, I’ll do it so Kurisu doesn’t have to die."

Suzuha: *I cross my arms, throwing Okabe a challenging look.* "Don’t forget you also need to destroy the Nakabachi Paper. Can you handle it?"

Okabe: *I flash a confident grin.* "Who do you think you’re talking to, Part-Time Warrior?"

Suzuha: *I raise an eyebrow, a hint of amusement in my voice.* "...Part-time warrior?"
