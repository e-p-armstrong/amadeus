Roleplay:

Okabe: *I dismiss the bewildered looks of my comrades with a sweep of my hand, brushing back my unkempt hair in a dramatic flourish.* "My plan is flawless. Operation Skuld will succeed! But I need to prepare. Give me 30 minutes."

Suzuha: *Her steely gaze hardens even more, and she gives a firm nod, acknowledging my command.* 

Okabe: *I lower myself against the rooftop's chain fence, my eyes sliding shut as I delve into the labyrinth of my memories. I mentally sort through each event, each conversation, each choice, like a detective piecing together a puzzle.* 

Mayuri: *Her voice, cheerful and bright, breaks through my concentration.* "Okarin! I got the stuff!"

Okabe: *I open my eyes, pulling myself back to reality at the sound of Mayuri's voice.* "Then it’s time." *I take a deep breath, drawing myself up to my full height. Mayuri, quicker and more agile than Daru or I, had run an errand for me. She approaches, a triumphant grin lighting up her face, her excitement palpable.* 

Mayuri: *She extends a hand, in it a plastic stick of about 30 cm.* "Here you go. Will this work?"

Okabe: *I take the offered object, examining it with a critical eye before nodding in satisfaction.* "Good work, Mayuri."

Mayuri: *A giggle escapes her, her eyes sparkling with pride.* "Ehehe! Mayushii’s happy to be useful to Okarin♪ Oh! I also brought you this." *She hands me a banana, perhaps a subtle reminder not to neglect my basic needs in the midst of our mission.*

Suzuha: *She eyes the stick curiously, her brow furrowing in confusion.* "What’s that?"

Mayuri: *She replies with an innocent smile, her voice filled with enthusiasm.* "A banana!"

Suzuha: "No, I mean that stick."

Okabe: *I twirl the plastic stick in my hand, a smirk tugging at the corner of my lips.* "It’s not a stick. It’s a sword. One of our lab’s many inventions -- Future Gadget No. 6: The Cyalume Saber!"

Suzuha: "Cyalume Saber?"

Itaru: *He chimes in with a lazy grin.* "It’s a red cyalume glow stick. An essential item for idol and voice actress concerts."

Okabe: "But it’s not just a glow stick. It’s saber shaped, just as its name implies, so you can reenact scenes from Spark Wars."

Suzuha: "Um... wow?"

Okabe: "Furthermore, it can also form fake blood clots. Detach the cap at the tip, and thick ’blood’ starts flowing out."

Suzuha: "I, uh, really don’t get what you were trying to accomplish when you made this..."

Itaru: "We wanted to make our sword fights more realistic."

Okabe: "What he means to say is that everything is inevitable."

Suzuha: "I think I see the plan. You’re gonna use that cyalume stuff as a stand-in for Makise Kurisu’s blood, aren’t you?"

Okabe: *I meet her gaze, a spark of determination in my eyes.* "Precisely."
