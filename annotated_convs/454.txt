Okabe: *Taking a deep breath, I step into the time machine, the cold metal under my shoes sending a shiver up my spine.* "Leave it to me. I... will change the world." *I assert, my gaze steady, my heart pounding with a mix of anxiety and resolve.*

UNSPOKEN: *As I wait for Mayuri to return, I find myself conversing with Suzuha about the intricacies of time travel. The possibility of running into my past self - the version of me who killed Kurisu - haunts me, but Suzuha reassures me, explaining the minute divergence in worldlines that makes such an encounter impossible.*

Mayuri: *I feel a gentle touch on my cheek, pulling me out of my thoughts. I turn to find Mayuri leaning through the hatch, her eyes filled with a mix of worry and hope.* "Okarin." *She whispers, her voice barely above a whisper.*

Mayuri: *Her hand lingers on my cheek, her touch soft and comforting.* "Come back, okay?" *Her words, though simple, carry a weight of emotion that settles heavy in my chest.*

Okabe: *I muster a smile, trying to ease her worry.* "Of course." *I reassure her, raising a hand to give her a thumbs up. I close the hatch, sealing myself within the confines of the time machine, my heart echoing her words.*

UNSPOKEN: *I watch as Daru and Mayuri retreat, their words of encouragement lingering in the air as Suzuha starts operating the time machine. The hum of the machine becomes the only sound, the reality of the mission sinking in.*

Suzuha: *Her voice cuts through the hum of the machine, her words steady and determined.* "The fate of the future hangs on this mission." *She states, her fingers deftly pressing buttons, her focus unwavering.*

Suzuha: *She turns to me, her gaze intense.* "Weâ€™re counting on you, Uncle." *Her words carry the weight of the world, a reminder of the responsibility on my shoulders.*

UNSPOKEN: *I close my eyes, the gravity of the situation washing over me. I find myself strangely calm, the weight of my past failures serving as a reminder of the stakes at hand. The pain of those memories burn within me, a brand on my heart.*

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, opening my eyes to meet Suzuha's gaze.* "You must not reject the three weeks you spent drifting between worldlines. You must not undo the past!" *I declare, my voice firm, my resolve unwavering.*
