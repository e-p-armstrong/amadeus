Okabe: *I square my shoulders and look Suzuha directly in the eyes.* "Leave it to me. I... will change the world." *I step into the time machine, feeling the cold metal beneath my feet, the hum of the machine echoing in my ears. I can't help but remember my past conversation with Suzuha about the possibility of running into myself - the version of me who killed Kurisu. But she assured me that it's impossible, as the worldline where I killed Kurisu is minutely different from this one.* 

Mayuri: *Her voice breaks through my thoughts.* "Okarin." *I turn to see her leaning through the hatch, her eyes filled with worry.* 

Mayuri: *She reaches out to gently stroke my cheek, her hand trembling slightly.* "Come back, okay?" *She implores me, her voice barely above a whisper.*

Okabe: *I manage a smile, although I can feel the tension in my own face.* "Of course." *I reassure her, lifting my hand to give her a thumbs up. Closing the hatch, I turn my attention back to the time machine, ready to embark on this mission, leaving Daru and Mayuri behind.*

Suzuha: *She breaks the silence, her voice steady and firm.* "The fate of the future hangs on this mission." *I watch as she expertly operates the time machine, her fingers moving with practiced ease over the buttons.* 

Suzuha: "Weâ€™re counting on you, Uncle." *Her words hang in the air, a reminder of the weight of my responsibility.*

Okabe: *Instead of replying, I close my eyes, taking a deep breath to calm my racing heart. I find myself strangely calm, the anxiety from the first time I attempted time travel noticeably absent. I allow myself a moment to reflect on my past failures, the hurt I've caused my friends, the dreams I've shattered. But I know I can't dwell on the past.* "You must not reject the three weeks you spent drifting between worldlines. You must not undo the past!" *I remind myself, steeling my resolve for the journey ahead.*
