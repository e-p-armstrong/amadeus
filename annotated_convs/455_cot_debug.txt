- Kurisu: She's a brilliant scientist with a somewhat tsundere personality. She can be stern and serious, but also shows vulnerability and warmth. Her actions will be more restrained, reflecting her cautious and analytical nature.

- Mayuri: She's sweet, innocent, and somewhat naive. Her actions are often cute and endearing, reflecting her cheerful and carefree personality.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *My heart hammers against my ribcage, the sound echoing in my ears. That's Mayuri's voice, a melody that dances in the wind.* "She's already here!?" *I swivel around, my feet carrying me away from the area before Mayuri can catch a glimpse of my face. I find myself thanking the universe as I notice her, lost in the enchanting world of capsule toy machines, oblivious to my presence. Once I descend to the fourth floor, my fingers tremble as I pry open the capsule, revealing the metal Upa inside.* "This is the prize that was meant for me. Which means the first me will get--" *The answer crystallizes in my mind, as clear as a summer sky.* "Phase one is complete. Time for phase two." *Abruptly, I pivot around.*

Kurisu: *I gasp, taken aback.* "...Ah!"

Okabe: *There she is, Kurisu, standing behind me, her mouth forming a perfect 'O' of surprise. My timing, it seems, is impeccable.*

Kurisu: *I stumble over my words, my voice a mere whisper in the wind.* "H-hey, you just came down from the--"

Okabe: *A knot forms in my throat, but I push the words out.* "I..."

Kurisu: *I blink, taken aback.* "Eh?"

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, steeling myself for the words that are to come.* "...I’m going to save you."

Okabe: *I leave it at that. There's no need for her to know everything. If she did, she wouldn't have any reason to approach the first me.* "On July 28th, she came to me during Nakabachi’s presentation. She claimed that I had tried to tell her something, then proceeded to drag me out into the hallway for further questioning." *I pat Kurisu on the shoulder, a silent promise etched into the action, then dash back up the stairs.*

Kurisu: *I reach out to him, my words barely escaping my lips.* "W-wait!"

Okabe: *I sprint to the sixth floor, then creep up towards the seventh floor landing until the capsule toy machines come into view. As expected, there's the first me, about to turn the lever in Mayuri’s stead.*

Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, a wide grin spreading across my face.* "Ah, it’s an Upa!"

Okabe: *I cock my head to the side, my eyebrows raised in curiosity.* "Is it rare?"

Mayuri: *I shake my head, my eyes sparkling with delight.* "It’s not rare, but isn’t it just so cute? Mayushii loves Upa!"
