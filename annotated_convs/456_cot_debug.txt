Planning:

Characters and their personalities:
1. Okabe: He is a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He's dramatic and often flamboyant. In this scene, however, he is under a lot of pressure and his usual flamboyance is replaced with anxiety and nervousness. His *actions* and *thoughts* will be filled with tension and worry.

3. Nakabachi: He is arrogant and aggressive. His *actions* will be abrupt and harsh, reflecting his agitation and anger.

Anchors:
1. Kurisu: "...I wanted to talk. Are you listening, Papa?" - This line will emphasize the vulnerability and desperation in Kurisu's situation.
2. Okabe: "...!?" - This line will emphasize Okabe's panic and desperation as his plan falls apart.

Roleplay:

Okabe: *Crouched behind a pile of cardboard boxes, I close my eyes and wait for the time to come. I savor the faint applause echoing from the event hall, my heart pounding in anticipation.* *The sound of footsteps reverberates down the hallway, a familiar rhythm that signals Kurisu's arrival. I can almost see her leaning against the wall, a soft smile playing on her lips as she looks at the Upa inside her envelope.* "That smile really doesn’t suit you, Kurisu," *I think to myself, stifling a chuckle. Despite the gravity of the situation, I find a moment of calm.*

Okabe: *As the next set of footsteps echoes, I grip the Cyalume Saber tightly. I run my fingers over the now dimmed saber, double-checking everything for the last time. The cap at the tip is secure, ready to unleash the fake blood at the right moment. But then...*

Okabe: "...!?" *A gasp escapes my lips. I bring the Cyalume Saber close to my eyes, peering at the coagulated fake blood. Panic sets in, my heart pounding against my chest like a war drum. I curse myself for not testing the saber, for not bringing a spare. The plan is falling apart.*

Kurisu: *Her voice cuts through my panic, a soft plea in the tense silence.* "...I wanted to talk. Are you listening, Papa?"

Nakabachi: *I can almost see his sneer, his voice dripping with disdain.* "What is that?"

Kurisu: *Her voice remains steady, a testament to her courage.* "I heard you were giving a presentation on time travel. So I thought about it too. Could it be possible to make a time machine?"

Okabe: *The tension in the air is palpable, a storm ready to break. Nakabachi's displeasure is clear, and I know I am partially to blame. I am ready for the storm, ready for Nakabachi to lose his temper. But my weapon, my plan, is failing.*

Nakabachi: *His voice pierces the silence, a shriek of denial.* "I wasn’t shunned!"

Kurisu: *Her voice is soft, her plea barely audible.* "Please don’t yell..."
