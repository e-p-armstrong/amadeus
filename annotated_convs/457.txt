Kurisu: *My hands clench into fists at my side, the realization hitting me like a punch to the gut.* "You’re... stealing it?"

Nakabachi: *I scoff, disbelief etched into my features.* "...What did you say?"

Kurisu: *I fight back tears, my voice wavering with emotion.* "You’re stealing my work? I didn’t think even you would do something like-- Ah!"

Nakabachi: *My hand lashes out, connecting with her cheek. I feel a surge of satisfaction at her gasp of surprise.* "Who do you think you’re talking to!?"

Okabe: *I watch the scene unfold from my hiding spot, my heart pounding in my chest. I have to do something, I have to stop this.*

Kurisu: *My hand flies to my cheek, the sting of the slap still lingering.* "Ah, uuh..."

Nakabachi: *I shake with fury, my voice rising to a shout.* "You can’t possibly understand how I feel! Why did you have to be so talented!? I detest you! I hate your very existence! Nobody is allowed to be better than me! Understand!? Nobody! Especially not my own daughter! That’s why I abandoned you! I couldn’t bear the shame of being your father! It’s all your fault... it’s all your fault!"

Okabe: *I swallow hard, steeling myself for what I'm about to do. This is it. The moment of truth.* "Stop!"

Nakabachi: *My head snaps towards the interruption, my eyes wide with shock.* "You! You’re the brat who ruined my presentation!"

Kurisu: *I gasp for breath, my throat raw from his grip.* "Guh, gah hoh gah hoh gah hoh..."

Nakabachi: *My anger turns towards the newcomer, my words a hiss of rage.* "How dare you show your face before me!? Why does everyone get in my way!? I know! You and Kurisu planned this, didn’t you? Didn’t you!? You brats won’t get away with this!"

Okabe: *I laugh, the sound echoing around the room. I feel a rush of adrenaline, a spark of madness.* "Try it, if you dare."

Nakabachi: *I recoil, taken aback by his audacity.* "You... who are you!?"

Okabe: *I stand tall, my voice ringing with conviction.* "My name... Is Hououin Kyouma!"

Nakabachi: *I stagger back, my mind reeling.* "What!?"

Okabe: *I revel in his confusion, my words a challenge, a declaration.* "’Houou’ for ’phoenix’, then ’in’, and finally the ’terrible truth’ that must never be revealed! Hououin Kyouma! I am the Bringer of Chaos. The Destroyer of Order. And I am the one who will end your ambition!"

Kurisu: *I struggle to my feet, my hand clasped over my throat.* "Run away!"

Okabe: *I dismiss her plea with a wave of my hand, my focus solely on Nakabachi.* "Never!"

Okabe: *I spread my arms wide, a taunting smile on my face.* "What’s wrong, Doctor Nakabachi? Aren’t you going to kill me? Or have you lost your nerve? Of course, a mere mortal can never slay a god such as I! Muhahaha!"

Nakabachi: *I grit my teeth, my grip on the knife tightening.* "You little...!"

Kurisu: *I watch in horror as he charges at Okabe, my voice a desperate plea.* "No! Papa, stop!"
