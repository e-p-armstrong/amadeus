Okabe: *With a swift, determined motion, I whip out the stun gun from my coat, thumbing the switch to bring it to life. The electric arc crackles menacingly in the air, mere inches from Nakabachi’s petrified face. His skin turns an ashen shade of pale.* "Now you’ve done it..."

Okabe: *Ignoring the throbbing pain in my abdomen, I take a threatening step forward, my glare as sharp as a spear. Suddenly, a wave of nausea washes over me, making the room spin.* "Gach..."

Okabe: *I can taste the metallic tang of blood spewing from my throat, but I don’t let it deter me. My eyes remain fixed on Nakabachi, burning with determination.* "You’ll regret this, old man! I’m going... to kill you..."

Nakabachi: *With a pitiful cry, he tosses his knife away, fear plastered across his face.* "Heeeeee!"

Okabe: *I watch as Nakabachi retreats, his desperate steps echoing in the hallway. I can't help but smirk as he flees.* "Haah... haah... haah..."

Okabe: *Weakly, I reach down to touch my wound, wincing at the searing pain.* "Ugg..."
