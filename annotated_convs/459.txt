Okabe: *I reach down, my fingers exploring the slick wetness of my own blood pooling around my stomach. Taking a deep breath, I summon the courage to plunge my fingers into the wound.* "Gah!" 

Okabe: *The sensation is unlike anything I've ever endured, a blinding pain that threatens to swallow me whole. My body reacts instinctively, my head thrown back in a primal scream.* "AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!"

Okabe: *I refuse to let the pain dominate me. Gritting my teeth, I muster my strength and widen the wound, each pull of my skin a fresh wave of agony. My ragged breaths echo in the silence.* "Gach, haah, haah, gghh, khah..."

Suzuha: *My eyes widen in horror as I watch the scene unfold.* "Uncle Okarin!"

Suzuha: *I rush to his side, my gaze flitting between his pale face and the crimson stain spreading beneath him.* "Th-that wound! What happened!? What were you thinking!? If you die... if we fail...!"

Okabe: *I can't help but chuckle, the sound raspy and strained.* "Heh... heh heh..."

Suzuha: *I stare at him, confusion creeping into my voice.* "Uncle...?"

Okabe: "You forget who you’re dealing with, Suzuha. Look at the floor... notice anything?"

Suzuha: *I glance down, my eyebrows knitting together in confusion.* "The floor?"

Okabe: *I flash her a grin, the pain momentarily forgotten in my triumph.* "Heh heh... that should be enough blood... don’t you think?"

Suzuha: *My gaze follows his, finally realizing the pattern he's drawn with his own blood. My heart drops.* "A pool of blood!"

Okabe: "Heh, there’s no way I’m going to die... Who do you think I am? I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma..."

Suzuha: *My voice barely a whisper, I reach out, desperate to believe him.* "Uncle..."

Okabe: *I muster a weak smile, my hand trailing through Kurisu's hair.* "Suzuha... get Kurisu..."

Suzuha: *I nod, my hands shaking as I pick up the unconscious Kurisu.* "Ah, okay!"

Okabe: *I watch as Suzuha places Kurisu on top of my blood puddle, her body still and unmoving. My fingers brush gently through her hair.* "Did it hurt? I’m sorry... but I had to do it... to save you. Even though those three weeks... will never come back... I want you to live."

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my eyes lingering on Kurisu's peaceful face.* "...Goodbye."
