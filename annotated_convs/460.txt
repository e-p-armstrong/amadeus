Suzuha: *I grit my teeth, my gaze intense as I look at the man before me.* "This is crazy, Uncle. You’re insane!"

Okabe: *I laugh weakly, a bitter smile playing on my lips despite the pain that shoots through my body.* "Insane? Nonsense. This is all... according to plan... heh heh... heh..."

Suzuha: *I shake my head, my hands steady as I start the time machine.* "Don’t talk. I’ll take you back to August 21st. Try to endure the Gs, okay? Damn! I should’ve brought a first aid kit." *I feel a pang of regret, wishing I had been more prepared for this situation.*

Okabe: *The pressure is crushing, the pain from my wound throbbing in time with my heartbeat. I want to groan, but I bite my lip, enduring the pain. The time machine whirs to life, rainbow lights filling my vision. I can feel Suzuha’s hands on me, wrapping my wound with a towel.*

Suzuha: *I continue to speak, my voice firm despite the worry that gnaws at me.* "Hey, Uncle. I’m sure Steins Gate is waiting for us on the other side. A world where nothing is known, where anything is possible. A world where you live, where Makise Kurisu lives, where Shiina Mayuri lives. A world where I have no reason to travel to 2010. The future may still lead to World War Three... It may lead to a dystopia ruled by SERN..."

Okabe: *I can feel her hand in mine, her grip warm and strong. It's reassuring, a lifeline in the midst of my pain and confusion.*

Suzuha: *I squeeze his hand, a determined look on my face.* "But now, there is hope for the future again."

Okabe: *My breath comes in short gasps, the pain becoming distant as I focus on Suzuha's words. I can feel my eyelids becoming heavy, but I force them to stay open.*

Suzuha: *My voice trembles a bit, but I force it to stay steady.* "Once we arrive, I’ll probably disappear. I won’t be able to thank you for bringing me to Steins Gate. So I’ll say it now."

Okabe: *I can feel her grip on my hand loosen, the warmth slowly fading. I want to hold on, but my strength is fading.*

Suzuha: *I take a deep breath, my voice full of resolve.* "Thank you, Uncle. Don’t die. Live. And in seven years... let’s meet again, okay?" *I force a smile, my heart heavy with the weight of our impending separation.*
