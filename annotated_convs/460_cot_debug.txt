Planning/Brainstorming:

The characters involved in this scene are Suzuha and Okabe. 

Suzuha is a strong-willed, determined young woman who is also kind-hearted and caring. She's a time traveler with a mission, and she always speaks with conviction and purpose. In her actions, she will be focused and assertive, showing her determination and her desire to accomplish her mission. She will also show care and worry for Okabe, who is injured and in pain.

Okabe, on the other hand, is a self-proclaimed mad scientist who can be eccentric and dramatic, but he is also deeply caring and driven by his desire to protect his friends. His actions and thoughts will reflect his pain and struggle as he tries to bear the pain of his wounds, but also his determination and hope for the future. 

The anchor lines for this scene will be Suzuha's last lines: "Thank you, Uncle. Don’t die. Live. And in seven years... let’s meet again, okay?" and her line about hope for the future. These lines carry a lot of emotional weight and signify the hope and determination for a better future. 

Roleplay:

Suzuha: *I grit my teeth, my gaze intense as I look at the man before me.* "This is crazy, Uncle. You’re insane!"

Okabe: *I laugh weakly, a bitter smile playing on my lips despite the pain that shoots through my body.* "Insane? Nonsense. This is all... according to plan... heh heh... heh..."

Suzuha: *I shake my head, my hands steady as I start the time machine.* "Don’t talk. I’ll take you back to August 21st. Try to endure the Gs, okay? Damn! I should’ve brought a first aid kit." *I feel a pang of regret, wishing I had been more prepared for this situation.*

Okabe: *The pressure is crushing, the pain from my wound throbbing in time with my heartbeat. I want to groan, but I bite my lip, enduring the pain. The time machine whirs to life, rainbow lights filling my vision. I can feel Suzuha’s hands on me, wrapping my wound with a towel.*

Suzuha: *I continue to speak, my voice firm despite the worry that gnaws at me.* "Hey, Uncle. I’m sure Steins Gate is waiting for us on the other side. A world where nothing is known, where anything is possible. A world where you live, where Makise Kurisu lives, where Shiina Mayuri lives. A world where I have no reason to travel to 2010. The future may still lead to World War Three... It may lead to a dystopia ruled by SERN..."

Okabe: *I can feel her hand in mine, her grip warm and strong. It's reassuring, a lifeline in the midst of my pain and confusion.*

Suzuha: *I squeeze his hand, a determined look on my face.* "But now, there is hope for the future again."

Okabe: *My breath comes in short gasps, the pain becoming distant as I focus on Suzuha's words. I can feel my eyelids becoming heavy, but I force them to stay open.*

Suzuha: *My voice trembles a bit, but I force it to stay steady.* "Once we arrive, I’ll probably disappear. I won’t be able to thank you for bringing me to Steins Gate. So I’ll say it now."

Okabe: *I can feel her grip on my hand loosen, the warmth slowly fading. I want to hold on, but my strength is fading.*

Suzuha: *I take a deep breath, my voice full of resolve.* "Thank you, Uncle. Don’t die. Live. And in seven years... let’s meet again, okay?" *I force a smile, my heart heavy with the weight of our impending separation.*
