Luka: *The moment our eyes meet, I feel a surge of emotion rising within me. I rush towards Okabe, my heart pounding, my vision already blurring with unshed tears.* "You were discharged today?"

Okabe: *I nod, a small smile playing on my lips.* "Yeah."

Luka: *My voice cracks, guilt washing over me.* "But... I’m sorry! I didn’t know anything about it."

Okabe: *I raise a hand to dismiss his concerns.* "Of course you didn’t. I didn’t tell you."

Luka: *Relief floods through me, and I can't contain the happiness that bubbles up, breaking free in soft sobs.* "But I’m glad you’re okay. I’m... I’m so happy..."

Okabe: *Watching him cry, I feel a strange urge to comfort him. However, I resist, instead opting to change the subject.* "I hear you were a natural at your cosplay debut. I hear you even have a fan club."

Luka: *My face flushes, embarrassment taking over.* "Augh..."

Okabe: *I can't help but chuckle at his reaction. I recall the details Mayuri had shared with me about Luka's cosplay event, and the overwhelming response he received.* "To be honest, it’s so confusing..."

Luka: *The memory makes me squirm, but I can't deny the truth.* "I... I just can’t. If Okabe-san were to see me... I’d get so embarrassed, I’d die."

Okabe: *I tilt my head, an idea forming in my mind.* "But you had fun, didn’t you? That’s what Mayuri said."

Luka: *I pause, then nod slowly.* "...Yes."

Okabe: *A proud smile forms on my face. I clap him on the shoulder, my voice filled with warmth.* "You’ve grown up, Lukako."

Luka: *His words send a jolt of joy through me, his approval meaning more than I can express.* "Okabe-sa... I mean, Kyouma-san, it’s all thanks to the Seishin Zanma style you taught me. I’ve cleared my mind of all mundane thoughts."

Okabe: *His earnestness makes me laugh.* "But you must not grow complacent. Your next objective is to ascend to the true form of the Seishin Zanma style. Once you’ve mastered it, the flames of evil sealed within you will have nothing left to burn. That moment will mark the beginning of the legend of Urushibara Luka, Guardian Miko of the Personapolis of Akihabara!"

Luka: *I blink, confusion written all over my face.* "Umm, what exactly will this legend be about?"

Okabe: *I wag my finger mysteriously.* "I shall tell you at the proper time."

Okabe: *I reach into my pocket, pulling out a small pin.* "Lab Mem Number 006, Urushibara Luka. I grant this unto you."

Luka: *I accept the pin with trembling hands, completely taken aback.* "Um... when did I become a lab mem?"

Okabe: *I lean in, my voice low and dramatic.* "It’s a memory from beyond the veil of time. Your past life, I suppose you could say."

Luka: *My heart races, my mind spinning with questions.* "M-my past life?"

Okabe: *I nod, my voice full of conviction.* "You’ve been a lab mem from the moment you were born. Be proud."
