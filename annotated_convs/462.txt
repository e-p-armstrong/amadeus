Okabe: *I arch an eyebrow, a curious glint in my eyes as I study Luka's expression.* "You don’t like it?"

Luka: *I shake my head quickly, my hands clasping tightly in my lap.* "No, it’s just... I’m really happy... sniff."

Luka: *Tears well up in my eyes again, spilling over my cheeks as the raw emotion overcomes me.* "I always wanted... to be a part of your lab... I wanted to be one of you... But... I never had the courage to ask... Thank you so much."

Luka: *I bow my head, my shoulders shaking with silent sobs of joy and relief.*

Okabe: *I hold out the artifact, the low light glinting off its surface.* "This is a precious artifact. Only eight of them exist in the entire world. It’s a magic item that protects you from all calamity."

Luka: *I lift my head, my eyes wide with awe and disbelief.* "R-really?"

Okabe: *I nod, a mischievous smile tugging at the corners of my mouth.* "So don’t lose it."

Luka: *I nod back, a joyful smile blossoming on my face.* "I won’t!"

Faris: *I spot Okabe as soon as he enters the cafe, and I bound over to him with a bounce in my step.* "Welcome back, myaster♪"

Faris: *I link arms with Okabe, pressing against him with a playful smirk.* "Kyouma!"

Okabe: *I peel Faris off me, my elbow tingling from the unexpected contact. I can feel the heat of the glares from the surrounding Faris fans.* "They let you outta the hospital, nya?"

Okabe: *I wipe the sweat off my brow and take a deep breath, trying to regain my composure.* "Y-yeah. I managed to claw my way out of hell."

Faris: *I lean back, my eyes sparkling with mischief as I craft yet another wild backstory.* "Purrcisely what I expected from the Hououin bloodline... The name of the undying phoenix isn’t just for show, nya."

Okabe: *I roll my eyes, a wry smile on my face as I take my seat and order my iced coffee.* "I know."

Faris: *I grin, my tail twitching with excitement as I share my latest news.* "Oh, right. We decided to open a second MayQueen location, nya. And it’s right on Chuo-dori, nyan. Isn’t that awesome, nya?"

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, a hint of concern creeping into my voice.* "Don’t you think you’re abusing your authority as redevelopment committee chair? Just a little?"

Faris: *I puff out my chest, a determined glint in my eyes.* "This is my sacred duty, nya. Now is the time to summon all the powers of moe to this holy land in preparation for their offensive, nya."

Okabe: *I lean forward, my eyes wide with mock horror.* "What? They’re going to attack? Did the Awakening occur while I was in the hospital?"

Faris: *I nod gravely, my voice dropping to a hushed whisper.* "That’s right, nya. They took your absence as their opportunity, nya. Will we be able to complete the moefication of Akiba before they hatch? That’s the only way to defeat them! It’s a race against time, nya. Faris also fought in the RaiNet AB tournament to gather Karma, but it was really tough by myself, nya."
