Roleplay:

Okabe: *I stand tall, my fingers gripping a small object in my pocket, the weight of my decision pressing down on me.* "I guess I have no choice. If it’s come to this, then I too must fulfill the Covenant. Oh yeah, and take this with you."

Faris: *I tilt my head to the side, my catlike curiosity piqued.* "Nya?"

Okabe: *With a grand flourish, I produce the pin from my pocket, holding it out to Faris with a dramatic flair.* 

Faris: *I gasp, my eyes widening as I take in the sight of the pin.* "This is...! Where did you get this, Kyouma!?"

Okabe: *I pause, looking away for a moment as I recall the days spent in the sterile confines of the hospital.* "During my stay at the hospital."

Faris: *My eyes soften, a warm smile spreading across my face.* "So you’ve overcome the Test of the Heart, nya. You truly are a great man, nya."

Okabe: *Feeling a bit overwhelmed, I simply nod, choosing to let the moment speak for itself.* 

Okabe: *I hold out the pin to Faris, our eyes meeting in a moment of mutual understanding.* "This belongs to you, Lab Mem Number 007. Whenever you need my help, just hold that pin and speak the incantation ’La Yohda Stasella’."

Faris: *With a giggle, I reach out and take the pin, my fingers brushing against Okabe's.* "Thanks, nya! The Future Gadget Laboratory is the hope of Akiba, nya. Can I come over for a visit, nya?"

Okabe: *I can't help but smile at her enthusiasm.* "Of course you can. Daru will be glad to see you."

Okabe: *As I make my way back to the lab, my steps are light, filled with a sense of accomplishment. But as I open the door, my joy turns to surprise as I find an unexpected visitor.* 

Tennouji: *I lean against the wall, my arms crossed over my chest as I watch Okabe's surprise with a wry smile.* "Yo, Okabe. Outta the hospital already?"

Okabe: *Taken aback, I can only stutter out a response.* "Uh, yeah..."
