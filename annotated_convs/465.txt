Okabe: *I give a playful bop on Mayuri's head, an affectionate gesture to lighten the mood.* "I’ll buy you some Juicy Chicken Number One later."

Mayuri: *Her eyes light up at the mention of her favorite snack, her usual cheerful energy returning in full force.* "Really? Thanks, Okarin! It was worth it to help you after all! Ehehe♪"

Okabe: *My heart swells at her innocent smile, a sigh of relief escaping my lips. Mayuri, my constant, my beacon of hope amidst the storm, is still alive. I've witnessed her death countless times, each memory etched into my soul, a haunting reminder of what I've lost and what I've fought for.* "Here, take these." *I offer Mayuri and Daru their pins, a memento of our time together, a symbol of our shared memories.*

Mayuri: *She takes the pin with an excited squeal, her eyes sparkling with delight.* "It’s so cute!"

Itaru: *Daru, ever the otaku, admires the pin with a smirk, his eyes gleaming with satisfaction.* "Nice, they’re finally done!"

Mayuri: *Her delicate fingers fasten the badge to her chest, spinning around to show it off with a playful pirouette.* "Gotta be sure to put this on every day. Or else I won’t be let into the lab!"

Okabe: *A chuckle escapes my lips at her playful antics. No one really made that rule, but it's just like Mayuri to add her own little flair to everything.* "But you know, there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you about the pin."

Mayuri: *Her brows furrow in confusion, her eyes meeting mine with a questioning gaze.* "What’s that?"

Mayuri: "There’s an inscription, right? It says ’OSHMKUFA 2010’. Okabe, Shiina, Hashida. And then Urushibara and Faris. I got those. But what about M, K, and A? Who are they?"

Okabe: *Her innocent question sends a pang through my heart. Makise. Kiryu. Amane. Names from a past that no longer exists, memories that only I carry. How do I explain to them about these ghosts from a forgotten worldline? How do I reveal to Daru that he's going to be a father? The thought alone makes me shudder, knowing full well the kind of reaction he'd have.*

Itaru: *His eyes would glint with an excited gleam, a smirk playing on his lips.* "Who’s my lucky bride-to-be? I hope she’s got a cute face, and delicious flat chest, and blonde hair, and twintails, and a golden ratio tsundere personality. And when she’s in dere-mode, she’s super cuddly and sexy!"

Okabe: *I can almost hear Suzuha's voice ringing in my ears, her final words echoing through the silence.* "Once we arrive, I’ll probably disappear. I won’t be able to thank you for bringing me to Steins Gate. So I’ll thank you now. Thank you, Uncle. Don’t die. Live."
