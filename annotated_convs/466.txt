Kurisu: *I scan the area, my heart pounding in my chest. As I spot Okabe, a wave of relief washes over me.* "I’ve been looking everywhere for you! Ever since you saved my life." *I swallow hard, my voice trembling with unshed tears.* "I was afraid I’d never have a chance to say thank you. I’m so glad we could finally meet." *I bow my head, my gratitude pouring out.* "Thank you. Thank you so much. And thank goodness you’re alright."

Okabe: *I blink, taken aback by her sincerity. My chest tightens as her words stir up a whirlwind of emotions within me.* "It’s me." *I murmur into my phone, my voice barely above a whisper.* "Why is she here? Reading Steiner didn’t activate. What? Protect her!? Heh... that’s a tall order, my friend." *I chuckle, a sad smile tugging at my lips.* "But if that is the choice of Steins Gate... then so be it. El Psy Kongroo." *I snap my phone shut, the tension in the air almost tangible.*

Okabe: *I clear my throat, a sense of determination filling me.* "We meet again, Christina."

Kurisu: *I flinch at the name, my eyes widening in surprise.* "How many times do I have to tell you!? I’m not Christina, or your assistant or--"

Okabe: "...!?" *My mind races, trying to make sense of her reaction.*

Kurisu: *I blink, confusion etched on my face.* "Eh?"

Okabe: *My heart skips a beat as realization dawns upon me.* "Huh? I... why did I say that? Words just... popped into my head..." *I murmur, my voice barely audible.*

Kurisu: *I stare at Okabe, my mind a whirlwind of confusion and surprise.*

Okabe: *I lean in, my voice soft and full of emotion.* "Welcome back, my assistant, Makise Kurisu -- no, Christina." *I reach into my pocket and pull out the last pin. My fingers tremble as I place the pin in Kurisu’s hand. I gently close her hand in mine, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my voice choked with emotion.* "This is the choice of Steins Gate."
