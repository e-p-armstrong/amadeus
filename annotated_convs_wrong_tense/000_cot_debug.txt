Plan: The scene begins with Okabe accusing Nakabachi of plagiarism. Okabe's actions should be fiery and passionate. As Kurisu intervenes, Okabe's actions become more cautious and suspicious. Kurisu remains calm and collected throughout, her actions reflecting her confusion and curiosity about Okabe's behavior. Action needs to be added for Kurisu snatching the phone and Okabe's reaction. 

Roleplay:

Rintaro: "Who the hell am I!?" *I point accusingly at Nakabachi on stage,* "Someone who knows you for a fraud, that's who! You stole your theory from John Titor! And you call yourself an inventor!?"

Nakabachi: "S-someone throw this man out!" *He stammers, his face flushing with embarrassment.*

Rintaro: "You're the one we should throw out, Doctor!" *I raise my voice, standing my ground.* "Have you no shame!? You have no right to call yourself an inventor!"

Nakabachi: "Shut your mouth, you little pest!" *His eyes narrow in anger.*

Rintaro: *Suddenly, I feel a firm grip on my arm. I turn around, ready to confront the person.* "Unhand me, you... huh?" *I find myself looking at a young girl. I recognize her from a magazine article my friend showed me a few days ago.* "Ah..."

Kurisu: "Could you come with me for a moment?" *She asks, her gaze stern.*

Rintaro: "Y-you're with the Organization!?" *I step back, a cold shiver running down my spine.*

Kurisu: "Huh?" *She looks at me, her face showing clear confusion.*

Rintaro: "If their tendrils have gotten this far, then I've made a grave mistake." *I scan the room, my mind racing with possible escape routes.*

Kurisu: "Stop fooling around and come with me." *She insists, her patience clearly wearing thin.*

Rintaro: *Seeing the angry looks from the crowd, I reluctantly follow her out of the assembly hall.* "Try anything and people are sure to notice. What will your superiors say then?"

Kurisu: "What are you talking about?" *She stops and turns to me, her brow furrowed in confusion.*

Rintaro: *Her glare sends a thrill of danger through me.* "I just need to ask you something."

Rintaro: "What makes you think I'll answer? I know how the Organization operates." *I cross my arms defensively.*

Kurisu: "What's with this 'Organization' stuff?" *She raises an eyebrow at me, clearly puzzled.*

Rintaro: *Ignoring her question, I pull out my phone and put it to my ear.* "It's me. I've been caught by an Organization agent. ...Yes, it's Makise Kurisu. She's a dangerous one. ...No, it's fine. I'll find a way to--"

Kurisu: *Suddenly, she snatches the phone from my hand.* 

Rintaro: "What are you doing!?" *I stammer, too surprised to react.*

Kurisu: "Huh? Your phone's off. ...Who were you talking to?" *She looks at me, her confusion growing.*
