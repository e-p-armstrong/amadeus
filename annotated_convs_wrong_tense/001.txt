Rintaro: "Guh!" *I grimace, feeling cornered. I scan the room, looking for an escape route. My gaze lands back on Kurisu, who's stepping closer, her eyes burning with determination.*

Kurisu: "What were you trying to tell me earlier?" *She asks, her voice steady.*

Rintaro: "What are you talking about?" *I feign ignorance, keeping my expression neutral.*

Kurisu: "About fifteen minutes ago. Before the conference started." *She insists, her eyes never leaving mine.*

Rintaro: *I blink in confusion, trying to recall the events she's referring to.* "Is this a trap?" *I wonder aloud, my mind racing.*

Kurisu: "You were trying to tell me something, right? You looked really upset." *She continues her interrogation, her gaze softening slightly.*

Rintaro: *I frown, my suspicion growing.* "Don't let her beauty fool you," *I whisper to myself, my gaze wary.*

Kurisu: "And how do you know my name?" *She questions, her tone shifting from accusatory to genuinely curious.*

Rintaro: "My knowledge has no limits." *I boast, puffing up my chest.* "I am a mad scientist, after all."

Rintaro: "Genius girl, our next meeting shall be as enemies!" *I declare, pointing a dramatic finger at her.*

Kurisu: "Huh?" *She blinks in surprise, completely taken aback by my sudden declaration.*
