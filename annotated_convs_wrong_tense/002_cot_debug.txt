Plan: The scene opens with Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru stepping out of an elevator. Okabe bumps into Kurisu, and is shocked to see her alive, as he had seen her dead just a few hours ago. There's a tense standoff between Okabe and Kurisu, with Okabe checking if she's real by touching her hair and poking her cheeks. Itaru interrupts with news of a mysterious email sent from Okabe's phone that appears to have come from the future.

Roleplay:

Rintaro: *As the elevator doors slide open, I step out, only to bump into someone. Quickly, I reach out to steady the person.* "Wha...!?" *I gasp, recognizing the girl I had seen dead just hours ago.* "You... you...!"

Kurisu: "Is there something wrong?" *She frowns, trying to back away, but I tighten my grip on her shoulder.*

Rintaro: "Y-you... You should be dead!" *I stammer, confused.* "Why are you here!?" 

Kurisu: "Hey, that hurts! Let me go!" *She pushes me away, giving me a wary look.*

Rintaro: "You're okay? But that's impossible! Someone stabbed you! I saw you lying in a pool of blood!"

Itaru: "That again?" *He interrupts, a puzzled look on his face.*

Rintaro: "What do you mean, 'again'?" *I question, my mind racing to make sense of the situation.*

Itaru: "I mean, you sent me that email like a week ago, right?" *He pulls out his phone, showing me the screen.*

Rintaro: "I sent you an email? Don't be ridiculous! I saw her dead just three hours ago!"

Kurisu: "Hey! Could you not talk about me like that? I'm perfectly fine." *She interjects, clearly not pleased.*

Itaru: "You know, that message was kinda weird. It was dated a week after I got it, which means it came from the future."

Kurisu: "It came from the future?" *She looks intrigued, stepping closer to examine Daru's phone.*

Rintaro: "That sounds like something you'd read on the internet, Daru. It's rare for you to talk about ridiculous theories." *I dismiss his claim, but I can't deny the evidence in front of me.*

Itaru: "No, the date was definitely a week later. It came from, uh... the 28th. Wait. That's today!" *He points at the date on the screen, the realization slowly sinking in.*

Rintaro: "This is the email I sent you three hours ago." *I confirm, my mind spinning with questions.*

Kurisu: "Interesting..." *She murmurs, her eyes not leaving the screen of Daru's phone.*

Rintaro: *While they're distracted, I reach out to touch Kurisu's hair, my hand shaking slightly.* "Substance. She has substance. Of course she's not a ghost. How silly of me." *I then poke her cheek, confirming that she's indeed alive.*

Itaru: "O-Okarin, I don't think that's a good idea..." *He warns, noticing my strange behavior.*

Kurisu: "...Hey." *She finally breaks away from the screen to give me a reproachful look, clearly unimpressed with my actions.*
