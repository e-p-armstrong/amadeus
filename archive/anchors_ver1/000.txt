Planning Stage:
The lines I have chosen to enhance in this scenario are Okabe (2), Kurisu (6), Okabe (9), and Kurisu (18). These lines, in my opinion, are pivotal moments in the scene where the characters' personalities shine through and the tension between them builds. I will aim to enhance these lines to bring out the depth of the characters' emotions, their motivations, and the underlying tension in the scene.

Okabe (2): This line is a powerful statement from Okabe, and it's the moment where he directly challenges Nakabachi's authority. I want to emphasize Okabe's defiance and fearlessness in this line, as well as his commitment to truth.

Kurisu (6): This is Kurisu's first direct interaction with Okabe. She is portrayed as stern and unyielding, and I want to heighten these characteristics, while also hinting at her curiosity and intrigue towards Okabe.

Okabe (9): Okabe's paranoia about the 'Organization' is a key aspect of his character. In this line, I plan to delve deeper into his fear and suspicion, while also highlighting his dramatic flair.

Kurisu (18): This is the moment where Kurisu realizes that Okabe's phone is off. I want to emphasize her confusion and disbelief, as well as her growing curiosity about Okabe.

Rewritten lines:
Okabe (2): *A surge of righteous anger propels me forward, my footfalls echoing ominously in the otherwise silent room.* "You're the one we should throw out, Doctor!" *My voice pierces the palpable tension, each syllable ringing out like a clarion call for justice.* "Have you no shame!? You have no right to call yourself an inventor!" *My words, laced with contempt and defiance, hang heavy in the air, challenging the very foundations of Nakabachi's fraudulent empire.*

Kurisu (6): *Emerging from the sea of bewildered faces, she firmly grasps my arm, her touch an unexpected tether in the chaos.* "Could you come with me for a moment?" *Her voice, steady and stern, cuts through my tirade like a knife. Her gaze, a fusion of stern command and deep intrigue, is a puzzle, a riddle wrapped in the enigma that is Makise Kurisu.*

Okabe (9): *With the realization of her potential allegiance, a cold dread seizes me, freezing me in place.* "If their tendrils have gotten this far, then I've made a grave mistake." *Each word drops from my lips like an icy pebble, my hand clutching my coat's lapel in a theatrical display of fear. My eyes dart around the room, seeing danger lurking in every shadow, every turned back, every stranger's face.*

Kurisu (18): *Her brows knit together in bewilderment, her fingers tracing the cold, dark screen of my phone.* "Huh? Your phone's off. ...Who were you talking to?" *The question hangs in the air between us, a silent testament to her growing confusion and intrigue. Her eyes, now filled with a curious blend of disbelief and curiosity, flicker from the inert device in her hand back to my face, silently demanding an explanation.*
