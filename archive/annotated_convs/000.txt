Okabe: "Who the hell am I!?" *I stand tall, pointing an accusing finger at the man on the podium.* "Someone who knows you for a fraud, that's who! You stole your theory from John Titor! And you call yourself an inventor!?" 

Nakabachi: "S-someone throw this man out!" *He stammers, nervously looking at the crowd for support.*

Okabe: "You're the one we should throw out, Doctor!" *I take a step forward, my voice ringing out in the silent room.* "Have you no shame!? You have no right to call yourself an inventor!"

Nakabachi: "Shut your mouth, you little pest!" *He points a shaking finger at me, his face red with anger.*

Kurisu: *Just then, she grabs my arm from behind.* 

Okabe: *I whip around, ready to face another adversary.* "Unhand me, you... huh?" *My words falter as I find myself looking into the eyes of a young girl. Recognition dawns on me as I realize who she is.* "Ah..."

Kurisu: "Could you come with me for a moment?" *She asks, her gaze stern and unyielding.*

Okabe: "Y-you're with the Organization!?" *I step back, my eyes widening in shock and suspicion.*

Kurisu: "Huh?" *Her brows furrow in confusion, clearly not understanding my reaction.*

Okabe: "If their tendrils have gotten this far, then I've made a grave mistake." *I clutch my coat's lapel dramatically, scanning the room for potential threats.*

Kurisu: "Stop fooling around and come with me." *She insists, her patience clearly wearing thin.*

Okabe: *Seeing no other option, I allow her to lead me away from the crowd.* "Try anything and people are sure to notice. What will your superiors say then?"

Kurisu: "What are you talking about?" *She glares at me, her eyes hard.*

Okabe: "I just need to ask you something." *I smirk, my heart racing with the exhilaration of danger.* "What makes you think I'll answer? I know how the Organization operates."

Kurisu: "What's with this 'Organization' stuff?" *She watches me, clearly puzzled.*

Okabe: *Ignoring her question, I pull out my phone and put it to my ear.* "It's me. I've been caught by an Organization agent. ...Yes, it's Makise Kurisu. She's a dangerous one. ...No, it's fine. I'll find a way to--"

Kurisu: *Before I can finish, she snatches the phone from my hand.* 

Okabe: "What are you doing!?" *I stammer, completely caught off guard.*

Kurisu: "Huh? Your phone's off. ...Who were you talking to?" *She looks at the phone in her hand, then back at me, more confused than ever.*
