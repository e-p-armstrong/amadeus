Okabe: "Guh!" *I flinch, feeling cornered under her intense scrutiny.*

Kurisu: "What were you trying to tell me earlier?" *She steps up, looking at me with an unwavering gaze, her eyes shining with determination.*

Okabe: "What are you talking about?" *I avoid her gaze, my mind racing to comprehend her unexpected question.*

Kurisu: "About fifteen minutes ago. Before the conference started." *She insists, her eyebrows furrowed as she tries to piece together my earlier behavior.*

Okabe: *Confused, I think back to fifteen minutes ago.* "Nonsense. This is the first time we've met. I was with Mayuri and that Upa toy fifteen minutes ago."

Kurisu: "You were trying to tell me something, right? You looked really upset." *She persists, her voice filled with genuine concern.*

Okabe: *I narrow my eyes suspiciously, wondering if this is some sort of trap.* "Is this a trap? It does seem like one of the Organization's dirty tricks. But would this girl do something that underhanded?"

Kurisu: "You looked like you were going to start crying any second. Why? Have we met before?" *She tilts her head slightly, her eyes reflecting her sincere confusion.*

Okabe: *I take a step back, her innocence making me even more wary.* "That's right, don't let her beauty fool you! She's a cold, calculating secret agent. If I show the slightest vulnerability, I'm done for!"

Kurisu: "And how do you know my name?" *She asks, her eyes narrowing as she tries to unravel the mystery.*

Okabe: "My knowledge has no limits." *I respond, trying to maintain an air of confidence.* "I am a mad scientist, after all."

Kurisu: *She blinks, taken aback by my dramatic proclamation.*

Okabe: "Genius girl, our next meeting shall be as enemies!" *I declare, turning to leave.*

Kurisu: "Huh?" *She stands there, looking utterly baffled by my sudden departure.*
