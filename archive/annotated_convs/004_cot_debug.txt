Daru: *As staff members approach, he throws me a small salute.*

Kurisu: "Um... okay." *She looks around the room, a small frown on her face.* "It's fine, I guess. It'll be easier to talk in a discussion format."

Okabe: *Silently, I give her a nod of approval, appreciating her quick thinking.*

Kurisu: "But before that, please listen to my thoughts on the subject." *She clears her throat, adjusting her glasses as she prepares to delve into her presentation.* "Scientists have proposed many theoretical models of time travel, but there are eleven in particular that bear mentioning."

Okabe: *I lean back in my seat, folding my arms as I listen intently.*

Kurisu: "Neutron Star Theory. Black Hole Theory. Lightspeed Theory. Tachyon Theory. Wormhole Theory. Exotic Matter Theory. Cosmic String Theory. Quantum Gravity Theory. Cesium Laser Theory. Elementary Particle Ring & Laser Theory. Dirac Antiparticle Theory."

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow, impressed despite myself.* 

Kurisu: "However, all of these models are purely theoretical. Some of them even contradict each other."

Okabe: "Well, what if someone comes up with a 12th model?" *I challenge, looking at her curiously.* 

Kurisu: "Hm? Ahh, uhh, right, well..." *She looks slightly taken aback, but recovers quickly.* "It could be contradicted by the 13th model, now couldn't it?"

Okabe: *I scowl, taken aback by her quick response.*

Kurisu: "By the way, time travel to the future is available to us right now, according to Einstein's special theory of relativity." *She strides across the stage, speaking with conviction.* "For example, let's say someone were to go to Haneda Airport and board a plane headed to Okinawa. Upon arrival, that person would be about one hundred millionth of a second farther into the future than I am."

Okabe: *I frown, trying to follow her line of thought.*

Kurisu: "According to the special theory of relativity, time moves slower for objects as they approach the speed of light." *She turns to me, a challenge in her eyes.* "For example, if you could run at near the speed of light, you could reach a point where time only moves half as fast for you. If you were to keep running at that speed for 24 hours, 48 hours would elapse in the rest of the world, meaning you would 'jump' one day into the future. Understand, Hououin Kyouma?"

Okabe: "Gah!" *I sigh, rubbing my temples as I try to process her words.*

Professor: "But that's not really time travel, is it?" *He interjects calmly, a thoughtful expression on his face.*

Kurisu: "Yes, you're right." *She concedes easily, a small smile on her face.*

Professor: "Then what about going to the past?" *He questions further, leaning forward in his seat.*

Kurisu: "Going to the past is possible right now." *She gazes at the audience, her hands clasped in front of her.* "Take a look at the sky at night. You can see light from tens of thousands of years ago, can't you?"

Student: "That's not time travel either!" *He interrupts, crossing his arms defiantly.*

Kurisu: "Well, I was just getting started." *She smiles slightly, not deterred by the interruption.*

Kurisu: "Let's say we wanted to make a machine that could physically transport people through time. What would we need? The best candidates for this are cosmic strings and wormholes." *She begins to explain, her voice steady and confident.* "A cosmic string is a string-shaped 'crevice' with extreme mass."
