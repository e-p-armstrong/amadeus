Kurisu: "The crevice is about as wide as an elementary particle, and at least as long as the diameter of a galaxy..." *She speaks confidently, each word carrying the weight of her knowledge.* 

Okabe: *I sit among the audience, engrossed in her lecture, each complex idea resonating with my own interest in time travel.* 

Kurisu: "...And that, roughly speaking, is time travel by means of cosmic strings. By the way, just so nobody misunderstands, cosmic strings are not the same as superstrings..." *She continues, her words stirring an undercurrent of chuckles among the audience.*

Okabe: *I chuckle along with the rest, entertained by her casual reference to the immense energy requirements.* 

Kurisu: "What do you think, Hououin-san? Care to take on the challenge of cosmic string time travel?" *She looks directly at me, a challenging glint in her eyes.*

Okabe: *Taken aback, I fumble for words.* "It's like a shortcut through space... right?" 

Kurisu: "Yes, that's correct." *She nods, a small smile playing at the corners of her mouth.* 

Okabe: *I breathe a sigh of relief, nodding appreciatively at her validation.*

Kurisu: "There are two wormholes joined by a tunnel. No matter how far away the wormholes are, transit time through the tunnel is zero..." *She continues, her words painting a vivid picture in my mind.* 

Okabe: *I sit back, my mind racing to keep up with her concepts.* 

Kurisu: "Say that the wormhole tunnel is being squished by an invisible fist. In order to pass through, you need something that could oppose my fist's 'grasping force' so that I can't squish anymore." *She raises her right fist, illustrating her point.*

Okabe: *I watch her demonstration, the concept slowly becoming clearer in my mind.* 

Kurisu: "If you stabilize the tunnel with exotic matter injection, instantaneous travel between wormholes becomes possible. To travel through time, however, takes a little more effort..." *She continues, her words now a whirlwind of concepts and theories.*

Okabe: *I lean forward, captivated by the complexity and sheer audacity of her ideas.*
