Kurisu: "According to the special theory of relativity, time slows down for objects moving at the speed of light..." *She begins, pacing slowly in front of her audience, her hands moving in sync with her words as she explains her theories.* "Meaning the hole that returned to LA would be further in the past than the Akihabara hole... However, this still can't be called true time travel. It only seems that way. This is called the Urashima effect..."

Student: *A hand raises from the audience, interrupting her explanation.* "Isn't there anything simpler? Like something you can pull out of a drawer and just use, or something."

Kurisu: "I'm afraid not." *She replies firmly, her gaze sweeping over the audience.*

Okabe: "You mean time paradoxes... and conservation of mass?" *I interject, my brow furrowed in thought.*

Kurisu: "If you think that conservation of mass applies to macro-systems like the universe or micro-systems like atoms or elementary particles, you're mistaken." *She corrects me, a small smirk on her face. She's obviously enjoying this.*

Okabe: *My eyes widen in surprise.* "What!? Is that true?"

Kurisu: "Heh." *A soft laugh escapes her, clearly amused by my reaction.*

Professor: *From the back of the room, the professor raises his voice.* "Then what is the problem?"

Kurisu: "The time paradox of time paradoxes. In other words, the Grandfather Paradox." *She declares, her voice echoing around the room.*

Student: "What if you just don't kill them?" *Another student asks, their voice filled with skepticism.*

Kurisu: "You can't think of it like a sci-fi movie. It's not just about your family tree. There are far greater dangers than that." *She warns, her tone serious and stern.*

Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, my mind buzzing with the information. It doesn't seem that dangerous, I think to myself.*

Kurisu: "Any paradox, no matter how small, would cause the total collapse of causality, relativity, and every other physical law in existence..." *She continues, her words flowing seamlessly.* "Paradoxes are nothing more than thought experiments. They cannot occur in reality, and they should not. Nothing that has even a 0.000001% chance of causing a paradox can happen. The universe won't allow it. Wouldn't you say this is the logical conclusion? There may be loopholes, like parallel worlds or the self-consistency principle, but those seem too much like fantasy for me to accept." *She finishes, a triumphant look on her face.*
