Okabe: *I watch as Kurisu turns her back to us, her shoulders stiff.* "I get it. You're both pervs."

Itaru: "Well... you could say that." *He shrugs, a sheepish grin on his face.*

Okabe: "I don't want to hear that from you." *I cross my arms, shooting him a disapproving glare.*

Kurisu: "Okay! If I came off as a little rude, I apologize." *She sighs deeply, turning back to face us.* "I was only acting that way because you molested me, but I'll ignore that for now. Please tell me what happened to this banana. I'd also like to hear about that..." *She glances at the PhoneWave (name subject to change)* "That microwave thing."

Okabe: "That's top secret. The one thing I'm cleared to share with unauthorized individuals is that its name is the PhoneWave (name subject to change)." *I state matter-of-factly.*

Kurisu: "Name subject to change? What's that about?" *She raises an eyebrow, clearly confused.*

Okabe: "PhoneWave is weak. It needs a better name." *I proclaim, waving a hand dismissively.*

Kurisu: "I couldn't care less about its name." 

Okabe: "I'm afraid that's the only information you're cleared for." *I reply, making a zipping motion across my lips.*

Itaru: "Hold on, Okarin. Makise-shi might be able to explain what's going on." *He interjects, pointing towards Kurisu.*

Okabe: "Hmm... well..." *I consider his suggestion, stroking my chin thoughtfully.* "You said your name's Christina, right?"

Kurisu: "Who the hell's Christina!? I never said that!" *She exclaims, taking a step back in surprise.*

Okabe: "If you wish to learn the secrets of this microwave, then you must meet my conditions." *I say, leaning in closer, my eyes gleaming with mischief.*

Kurisu: "...Which are?" *She asks, her eyes narrowed in suspicion.*

Okabe: "Condition One: You must become a lab mem." *I declare, holding up a single finger.*

Kurisu: "Ramen?" 

Okabe: "No! Lab mem, stupid! Short for laboratory member!" *I say, shaking my head in disbelief.* "You mean you want me to join your research team? I'm supposed to return to America in August."

Kurisu: "You're so full of it. Let's see the contract, then." *She demands, crossing her arms.*

Okabe: "What contract? This is a lab, not a corporation!" *I exclaim, throwing my hands up in exasperation.*

Kurisu: "I don't mind lending you my knowledge, but if there is more pervy nonsense involved, the answer is NO." *She warns, pointing a finger at me.*

Okabe: "Don't worry, we don't bite." *I assure her, holding my hands up defensively.* "No more molestation?"

Kurisu: "You said that was condition one. So there's gotta be a second one, right? It better not be--" *She begins to ask, her eyes narrowing in suspicion.*
