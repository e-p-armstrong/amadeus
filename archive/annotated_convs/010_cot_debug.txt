Kurisu: *She presses her fingers to her brow, shaking her head with a sigh.* "Geez... I feel like I'm hypersecreting noradrenaline. Let me pick my jaw up off the floor."

Okabe: *I cross my arms, looking at her with a smug grin.* "I don't care about your dislocated jaw! Do you accept the conditions or not? Answer me, Christina!"

Kurisu: *She glares at me, her hands on her hips.* "Stop adding -tina! My name's Kurisu!"

Okabe: "Hehehe, good answer. From this moment forth, you are Lab Mem Number 004. Welcome, Christina -- codename, The Zombie!" *I announce, theatrically extending my arm towards her.*

Kurisu: *She folds her arms across her chest, dismissing my theatrics with a roll of her eyes.* "I won't answer to either. Use my real name, Hououin."

Okabe: *We engage in a mini stare-down. I smirk at her defiance.* "You say something? Genius perv girl?"

Kurisu: "Come on! No more saying 'perv'! I won't treat you like a perv either! So let's drop it already!" *She pleads, trying to bring some order to the chaotic conversation.*

Okabe: *I nod, satisfied with her compliance.* "As long as you understand. Now for the issue at hand. Daru, give Christina--"

Kurisu: *She interrupts me again, her patience clearly wearing thin.* "No '-tina' either."

Okabe: *Ignoring her protests, I turn to Itaru.* "Give Kurisu-kun an explanation on our experiments so far."

Itaru: *He leans back in his chair, lazily waving me off.* "But I refuse."

Kurisu: *She nods attentively as I explain the experiment, quickly understanding the concept.* "Fascinating."

Okabe: *I lean in closer, eager to hear her opinion.* "Let's hear your opinion."

Kurisu: *She ponders for a moment before responding.* "I think we can at least throw out completely worthless theories like electromagnetic weaponry and teleportation."

Okabe: *I scoff at her dismissal of my theories.* "Can we run the experiment one more time? I want to see it for myself."

Kurisu: *Without waiting for our approval, she quickly grabs a banana and places it in the microwave, then starts entering commands on her phone.* "Okabe-san, Hashida-san, please watch the bananas."

Okabe: *I cross my arms, raising an eyebrow at her command.* "Who are you to give me orders? I am the mad scientist, Houou--"

Kurisu: *She interrupts, not even bothering to look at me.* "Whatever. Just keep your eye on the bananas!"

Itaru: *We both stare at the bananas, waiting for something to happen.* "Sixty seconds have passed. Any change?"

Okabe: *I continue to stare at the bananas, anticipation building within me.* "100 seconds."
