Kurisu: "Huh? Oh... uh... A-at 104 seconds, it d-disappeared. Abruptly. Yeah." *She stammers, her eyes wide with disbelief.*

Okabe: "So it is a teleporter! The first in human history!" *I proclaim, my fist clenched with excitement.*

Kurisu: *Quickly regains her composure and crosses her arms, falling into deep thought.* "Teleportation... is that even possible? It did move... No matter how unbelievable that may be... Could it be quantum teleportation... no, that only occurs on the quantum level..."

Okabe: "Don't avert your eyes from the truth! What you've seen with your own eyes is everything!" *I state emphatically, pointing at the experimental setup.*

Kurisu: "Did it really teleport? It's dangerous to reason from the conclusion." *She shoots a sharp look at me, her eyes narrowing.*

Okabe: "Well then, genius girl, what do you call this phenomenon?"

Kurisu: "Let's sort this out. Neither the banana bunch nor the frozen chicken teleported. Correct?" *She asks, pacing the room.*

Okabe: "...So, maybe there's a size limit for objects that can teleport."

Kurisu: "But aren't those chicken pieces smaller than bananas?" *She questions, her brows furrowed in thought.*

Okabe: "We used the same chicken for each experiment. They come in 12-packs." *I explain, shrugging slightly.*

Itaru: "That's quite a lot, then." *He comments, chuckling.*

Kurisu: "What about salt? You experimented with salt too, right?" *She questions, turning towards me.*

Okabe: "Of course we tried it without the plate, but that didn't change anything." *I reply, shaking my head.*

Kurisu: "Then, maybe each individual grain of salt was too small... or something? Hmm... I need a clue..." *She ponders, rubbing her temples.*

Okabe: "Not PhoneWave. PhoneWave (name subject to change)." *I correct her, a smirk on my face.*

Kurisu: "Forget about that. So? Have you noticed anything or not?" *She inquires, turning her gaze to Itaru.*

Itaru: "Oh, right! One time, it shot off a huge electrical discharge." *He recalls, his eyes lighting up.*

Okabe: "What!? I don't know anything about that!" *I exclaim, startled.*

Itaru: "That's because you weren't around when it happened." *He explains, shrugging.*

Kurisu: "Discharge? How much?" *She inquires, leaning in closer.*

Itaru: "It was like a fluorescent light lit up the development room. It lasted about two seconds, I guess." *He elaborates, mimicking the flash with his hands.*

Kurisu: "What were the circumstances?" *She questions, her eyes narrowing.*

Itaru: "I was adjusting the cellphone attached to it. I unhooked it and put my own in. A little bit later, sparky sparky." *He explains, motioning with his hands.*

Okabe: "When was that?" *I ask, my brows furrowed in thought.*

Itaru: "Around noon yesterday. When you went to see Doctor Nakabachi's presentation." *He replies, shrugging.*

Kurisu: "Doctor Nakabachi..." *She murmurs, a thoughtful expression on her face.*

Okabe: "That reminds me. I sent you an email back then. Did you get it?" *I inquire, turning to Itaru.*

Itaru: "An email?" *He questions, looking puzzled.*

Kurisu: "That email you showed me at ATF yesterday?" *She interjects, moving closer to me.*

Okabe: *I nod in response.* "It said someone stabbed me at the presentation, didn't it?"
