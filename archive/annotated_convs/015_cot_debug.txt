Okabe: *I feel my lips twist into a grin as I prepare to explain our discovery.* "First, let me say one thing. The greatest inventions are created by accident. This we call serendipity."

Kurisu: *She crosses her arms, her impatience evident.* "Get on with it."

Okabe: *Ignoring her interruption, I continue.* "The mail was sent to the past. The chicken returned to its frozen state. The plucked banana returned to the bunch."

Kurisu: *Her eyes widen in disbelief.* "...No way."

Okabe: *I nod, a smirk on my face.* "Yes way! The PhoneWave (name subject to change)... Is a time machine!"

Kurisu: *She recoils, shaking her head.* "A time machine? A time machine!? It can't be!!"

Okabe: *I glance around the lab. The summer sun is bright outside, but the lab is dim and humid. I feel the exhaustion weighing on me, my hands shaking slightly. I chug a bottle of Dr P, grimacing as my stomach protests. I glance at Daru, absorbed in his computer, his leg bouncing impatiently. The room is quiet, save for the humming of the electric fan and the clicking of Daru's mouse. The air is stale, heavy with the weight of our discovery. I push myself up from the chair, deciding to take a shower to stave off my growing fatigue.*
