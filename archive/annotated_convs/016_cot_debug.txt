Okabe: *I glance around, looking for Mayuri, only to find her a little distance away.* 

Mayuri: "I feel like I can reach the stars." *She reaches out to the sky, her fingers stretching as if to touch the invisible stars.*

Okabe: "It's too early for stars, Mayuri." *I walk up to her, watching her with a mix of exasperation and fondness.*

Mayuri: "Did you know? Even during the day, the stars are still up there." *She lowers her hand slowly, a dreamy smile on her face.* "Ehehe! That's true. Oh, just now, when I was looking at the stars, I decided to have ramen for lunch today!" 

Okabe: *I shake my head, unable to comprehend Mayuri's train of thought.* "Getting philosophical is nice and all, but it's dangerous to stop in the middle of the street." *I sigh, pulling out my phone to check my email. As I walk, I occasionally stop to sip on my mango juice with tapioca. I notice the crowd around Radi-Kan and the satellite still lodged in the building. I quickly type a response to Shining Finger, asking her to call me.* 

Okabe: *Suddenly, my phone buzzes with a reply.* 

Okabe: *I read her response, my fingers tapping against the side of my phone in thought.* "Wait, she wants it by email? There's a lot to cover. I'd rather not have to type it all out." *I quickly reply back, asking for her phone number and any information on the IBN 5100. As I put my phone back in my pocket, I see a familiar face among the crowd.*

Kurisu: "Ah." *She is standing a short distance away, her eyes wide in surprise as she recognizes me in the crowd.*
