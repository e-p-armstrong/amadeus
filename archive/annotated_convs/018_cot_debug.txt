Kurisu: "Hello? Can you put your phone away when you're talking with someone?" *She says, gesturing towards the device in my hand with a hint of irritation.*

Okabe: "Don't be like that. Rather, you should praise me, for I have taught a foul mail demon to behave like a civilized human being." *I say, waving my phone around for emphasis.*

Kurisu: "Why are you so pompous?" *She crosses her arms, raising an eyebrow at me.*

Okabe: "I'd ask you the same thing, Christina." *I smirk, leaning back against the table behind me.*

Kurisu: *She watches me silently as I type out a quick email on my phone and send it.* "Are you done with your little mail exchange? Hououin-san?"

Okabe: "Oh? So you remember my true name. Indeed, I am Hououin Kyouma." *I say, puffing out my chest in pride.*

Kurisu: "I was being facetious." *She rolls her eyes, clearly unimpressed.*

Okabe: "How was that facetious? You called me by my correct name. You made no mistake. You'll make a good assistant." *I declare, pointing a finger at her.*

Kurisu: "Okabe-san... have you sought professional help?" *She asks, tilting her head to the side.*

Okabe: "I am not Okabe!" *I protest, giving her a stern look.*

Kurisu: "This is exhausting..." *She sighs, rubbing her temples.*

Kurisu: "You're pompous, but at least you have some manners." *She comments, looking back at me.*

Okabe: "What do you mean?" *I ask, genuinely puzzled.*

Kurisu: "I hate people who play with their phones in the middle of a conversation." *She states, crossing her arms again.*

Okabe: "Ah, so that's why you grabbed my phone when we first met." *I recall, nodding in understanding.*

Kurisu: "When we first met? I didn't do that." *She denies, looking genuinely confused.*

Okabe: "Yeah you did. There I was, giving my report, when you grabbed my--" *I stop myself before I finish, my mind suddenly filled with conflicting memories.* 

Kurisu: "What? What do you mean 'giving your report'?" *She asks, looking at me with concern.*

Okabe: "No. It's nothing. So, about the PhoneWave (name subject to change). After the experiment, you screamed something like 'A time machine? It can't be!' Did something awaken a past trauma?" *I change the subject, waving away her previous question.*

Kurisu: "No. And don't go making one up either." *She says, her tone stern.*

Okabe: "Back when she was five years old, Christina was on the plains of Arkansas when lightning--" *I begin, only for her to cut me off.*

Kurisu: "I wasn't hit by lightning! And I was still living in Japan when I was five! And why Arkansas?" *She interrupts, looking exasperated.*

Okabe: "I was trying to imagine tranquil scenery, and the first state to come to mind was Arkansas. Second was Oregon." *I explain, shrugging.*

Kurisu: "Not Utah? I mean, relatively speaking, isn't Utah more suitable?" *She asks, giving me a skeptical look.*

Okabe: "Then answer me, Christina! Why did you freak out back then!?" *I demand, leaning towards her.*

Kurisu: "...No reason. I simply didn't want to believe. Fringe science should stay in the realm of fiction." *She admits, looking away.*

Okabe: "Fringe science? Don't be ridiculous. You saw it with your own eyes. You saw the email leap to the past! You saw the banana travel instantly through space!" *I argue, gesturing wildly.*

Kurisu: "I saw... but we must be missing something. Or maybe we're just seeing what we want to see. Remember what I said at ATF? Time machines are just a pipe dream given modern technology. And yet a bunch of amateurs like you just stick a phone and a microwave together and expect time travel to occur? Ridiculous." *She counters, her tone calm and logical.*

Okabe: "But it did occur! Will you deny what you saw with your own eyes? Are you saying that theories trump reality? Then I hope you enjoy sophistry and word games, because that's all you'll ever have!" *I retort, my tone rising with my agitation.*

Kurisu: "What do you mean, word games?" *She asks, looking at me with a puzzled expression.*

Okabe: "Quantum theory, for example. If you ask me, theories like that are nothing but word games!" *I declare, pointing my finger at her.*

Kurisu: "Wait, are you rejecting modern physics? Who do you think you are?" *She asks, her tone incredulous.*

Okabe: "Trust what you see! The only things that matter are things that happen; things that don't happen, things that aren't observed, are just hypotheses!" *I insist, pointing at her again.*

Kurisu: "When hypotheses pile up, and theories are verified, they become reality. That's how modern physics comes to understand the truth of the universe." *She finishes, meeting my gaze steadily.*
