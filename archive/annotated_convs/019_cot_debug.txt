 

Okabe: "I see." *I nod appreciatively, a smirk playing on my lips.* "Nice rebuttal."

Kurisu: "*She crosses her arms, her brow furrowing in frustration.* ...You're never getting off your high horse, are you?"

Okabe: "By the way, Christina," *I tilt my head, adopting a mockingly thoughtful expression.* "I have always felt that physicists are hypocrites."

Kurisu: "*She blinks, taken aback.* ...What?"

Okabe: "There are phenomena that everyone knows occur in reality, but which physicists refuse to research." *I lean forward, my eyes gleaming with challenge.* "What do you think about that?"

Kurisu: "I don't know what to say unless you can give me some examples." *She retorts, matching my gaze.*

Okabe: "Ghosts, for instance." *I say with a nonchalant shrug.*

Kurisu: "*She rolls her eyes, clearly exasperated.* The occult? Really?"

Okabe: "You refuse to research it just because it's the occult?" *I raise an eyebrow, pointing an accusing finger at her.* "That contradicts what you just said! 'You'll never reach the truth that way!' People have seen ghosts. There is even photographic evidence. So where are the theories? Why do physicists refuse to speak?"

Kurisu: "...It's a different field of study." *She says, her voice quiet but firm.*

Okabe: "You can't call physics the study of natural phenomena, then decide some things don't count!" *I retort, my voice rising in intensity.*

Kurisu: "True, but..." *She breaks off, her face thoughtful.*

Okabe: "And that's why we must investigate the phenomenon of sending emails to the past. You shall assist me!" *I declare, pointing a finger dramatically at her.*

Kurisu: "No." *She replies sharply, her eyes blazing as she glares at me.* "I won't have a hand in your fringe science. I won't make the same mistake my father did."

Okabe: "Your father?" *I ask, taken aback.*

Kurisu: "You make a fine argument, but it won't work in the scientific community." *She clenches her fists, her voice trembling slightly.* "The day you decide to research time travel is the day you're out of a job."

Okabe: "How can you be so certain?" *I challenge, raising an eyebrow.*

Kurisu: "Because that's what happened to my father." *Her voice breaks slightly, and she turns away to hide her grimace.*

Okabe: "I understand. I had no idea you hate time machines that much." *I say, my tone softer.* "It's almost like an allergy. I apologize for forcing you to become a lab mem. You don't have to come again."

Kurisu: "...I wasn't planning on it." *She mutters, her shoulders slumping in resignation.*

Okabe: "But know this, Christina." *I say, my voice firm.* "Lab Mem Number 004 will be a retired number. That number... is yours forever." *I finish my speech and turn my back to her, walking away slowly, eyes closed, hoping I don't bump into anyone.*

Kurisu: "You look ridiculous!" *Suddenly, she grabs my shoulder, pulling me back.* 

Okabe: "What are you doing!?" *I exclaim, nearly losing my balance.* "You've ruined my perfectly-staged exit scene! And you call yourself my assistant!?"

Kurisu: "No, I don't call myself your assistant!" *She snaps, clearly exasperated.* "And besides, I still have something to ask you!"

Okabe: "That was just something I hallucinated." *I say, hoping to end the conversation.* 

Kurisu: "Why would you dream about me?" *She persists, her expression stubborn.*

Okabe: "I don't know. And it wasn't a dream. It was a hallucination." *I clarify, meeting her gaze.*

Kurisu: "You said something about Doctor Nakabachi, didn't you?" *She asks, her curiosity piqued despite her earlier anger.*
