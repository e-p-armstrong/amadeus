Okabe: *I answer my phone, not recognizing the number on the screen.* "You're not from the Organization?" 

Kurisu: "...No. It's Makise." *Her voice comes through the phone, sounding slightly annoyed.*

Okabe: "Makise..." *I rack my brain, trying to place her voice.* "Sorry, but I don't remember. Tell me where we met. Paris? Or London, perh--"

Kurisu: "Akihabara. We saw each other yesterday, remember?" *She interrupts me, her voice growing more impatient.*

Okabe: *I snap my fingers in recognition.* "Oh! My assistant!"

Kurisu: "Not your assistant! Makise Kurisu!" *She argues, her voice raising slightly.*

Okabe: "If you don't say Christina, then I have no way of knowing it's you." *I retort, smirking to myself.*

Kurisu: "I'm not Christina either! How many times do I have to tell you?" *She sounds exasperated now, clearly frustrated with my antics.*

Okabe: "You never stop complaining, do you?" *I laugh, enjoying this playful banter.*

Kurisu: "Whose fault is that? Whose?" *She shoots back, her tone sharp with irritation.*

Okabe: *I narrow my eyes, suddenly suspicious.* "Wait a minute. How do you know my phone number?" 

Kurisu: "Hashida-san told me." *She answers calmly, her tone neutral.*

Okabe: "Oh, that's boring. So, what is it, assistant?" *I ask, leaning against a wall as I continue the conversation.*

Kurisu: "I said I'm not your assistant. Haah, what's the point... Where are you now?" *She sighs, sounding tired.*

Okabe: "I'm headed to Yanabayashi Shrine." *I respond, glancing at the shrine in the distance.*

Kurisu: "Ah, okay. Bye then." *She hangs up abruptly, leaving me in silence.*

Okabe: "Huh? What!? What was that!? Is she messing with me!? She's messing with me!" *I yell into my empty phone, feeling completely flabbergasted.*

Kurisu: *When I arrive at Yanabayashi Shrine, I find Kurisu waiting there for some reason. She's leaning against a tree, her arms crossed over her chest.* 

Okabe: "What was that phone call about?" *I ask, approaching her.*

Kurisu: "I just wanted to ask you where you were. And since you said you were coming here, I came." *She responds, shrugging.*

Okabe: "Nobody asked you to come." *I grumble, crossing my arms to mirror her stance.*

Kurisu: "And yet, here I am." *She smirks, clearly amused by my annoyance.*

Okabe: "Why did you come to see me?" *I ask, narrowing my eyes at her.*

Kurisu: "Not because I wanted to or anything. Don't get me wrong." *She quickly denies, avoiding my gaze.*

Okabe: "You come here to pick a fight?" *I accuse, pointing a finger at her.*

Kurisu: "I just want to know how the IBN 5100 and SERN are related." *She finally admits, her gaze serious.*

Okabe: "Don't you mean you're interested in SERN's time machine research? Be honest with yourself." *I challenge her, stepping closer.*

Kurisu: "Sh-shut up. I'm not interested in time machines at all. More importantly, did you find an IBN 5100?" *She stammers, flustered by my accusation.*

Okabe: "That's why I'm here." *I admit, gesturing towards the shrine.*

Kurisu: *She looks up at Yanabayashi Shrine's small archway, her brow furrowed in thought.* "A shrine?"
