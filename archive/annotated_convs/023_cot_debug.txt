Okabe: "Urushibara-shi. I'll be blunt. May I borrow this computer?" *I ask, my gaze fixed on the old PC with eager anticipation.*

Lukaâ€™s Father: "Sure." *He grants my request with a simple nod, causing me to blink in surprise.*

Okabe: "Seriously!?" *I gape at him, momentarily dumbstruck. I quickly regain my composure and bow deeply in gratitude.* "Of course! Thank you!"

Okabe: "Can't Americans start driving at 16? How come you don't have a license?" *I turn to Kurisu, a teasing glint in my eyes.*

Kurisu: "What, something wrong with that? I spend all my time doing research." *She retorts, crossing her arms over her chest.*

Okabe: "You're wasting your youth." *I chuckle, shaking my head at her.*

Kurisu: "I thought so too, until I met you. Now I realize I'm doing just fine." *She fires back, a smirk playing on her lips.*

Luka: "Umm, no fighting please..." *Luka interjects, wringing his hands nervously.*

Okabe: "You're a lifesaver, Lukako. Thank your father again for me." *I offer him a warm smile, my tone sincere.*

Kurisu: "Your father is a lovely man." *Kurisu comments, her gaze softening as she looks at Luka.*

Luka: "M-my father is m-married... a-ad-adultery... is bad!" *Luka stammers, his face turning a bright red. He looks between me and Kurisu, his eyes wide with panic.*

Kurisu: "Huh?" *She blinks, taken aback by his reaction.* "Hey, wait! Don't misunderstand, you two. That's not what I meant!" *She quickly tries to rectify the misunderstanding, her voice rising in desperation.*

Luka: "Eh, ah, of course... I'm sorry for the weird misunderstanding! That was so rude of me!" *He bows deeply, his voice filled with remorse.*

Kurisu: "Don't cry. We've resolved the misunderstanding, so it's all okay." *She reassures him, offering a comforting smile.*

Okabe: "...but in the depths of your heart lie feelings for Luka's dad." *I tease, unable to resist the opportunity.*

Kurisu: "Die." *She shoots me a glare, turning away in frustration.*

Okabe: "Lukako, don't forget your practice swings with Samidare." *I remind him, trying to lighten the mood.*

Luka: "Y-yes sir. I'll do my best... Umm, El Psy Kongalee..." *He nods, stumbling over the unfamiliar phrase.*

Okabe: "It's Kongroo! Don't forget it." *I correct him, trying to suppress a laugh.*

Luka: "I'm sorry!" *He apologizes, blushing in embarrassment.*

Kurisu: "Hey! What kind of lowlife teases a girl?" *She scolds me, her eyes flashing with indignation.*
