Kurisu: "Right back at you. You stopped to take a break at least five times along the way." *She shoots me a sidelong glance, her eyebrows raised in mild exasperation.*

Okabe: "That's because I wasn't feeling well..." *I pause, taking a moment to catch my breath.*

Kurisu: "Are you okay?" *Her tone softens, a note of genuine concern seeping into her voice.*

Okabe: "It's just... occasionally, my right arm aches... and when it does, dark destructive impulses overcome my soul--" *I clasp my aching arm dramatically, my eyes filled with mock torment.*

Kurisu: "Shut up, or I'll tear the peripheral nerves out of that arm." *She interrupts me with a fierce glare, her patience clearly running thin.*

Okabe: "You're right." *Ignoring her threat, I nod thoughtfully.* 

Suzuha: "Huh?" *She emerges from the workshop, her eyes widening in surprise at the sight of the heavy box.*

Okabe: "Hmph, you want to know? Then I'll tell you!" *I beam at her, ready to reveal our treasure.*

Kurisu: "Wait! If you're just going to stand and talk, shouldn't we put the box down first?" *She interrupts, her face straining under the weight of the box.*

Okabe: "Y-yeah... actually, wait, this will only take a second." *Barely managing to keep the box steady, I pause to catch my breath.*

Suzuha: "Well? What is it?" *She prompts eagerly, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.*

Okabe: "What if I told you... it's an IBN 5100?" *I reveal with a dramatic flourish, struggling to keep the triumphant grin off my face.*

Suzuha: "No way! You found it!? Wow! Way to go, Okabe Rintaro!" *She exclaims, her excitement palpable.*

Okabe: "Let's put it down!" *Finally, I give in to the strain, and together, Kurisu and I gently lower the box to the ground.*

Kurisu: "Haah..." *She breathes out a sigh of relief, shaking out her sore arms.*

Suzuha: "So, where was it?" *She asks, her eyes glued to the box.*

Okabe: "Yanabayashi Shrine." *I answer, wiping the sweat off my brow.*

Suzuha: "Yanabayashi Shrine? You mean like a Shinto shrine?" *She repeats, her brow furrowed in confusion.*

Okabe: "Yeah." *I nod, leaning against the box for support.*

Kurisu: "What is it? Have I done something wrong?" *She turns to Suzuha, her eyes narrowing in confusion and slight defiance.*

Okabe: "She works part-time at that store." *I answer, shrugging nonchalantly.*

Kurisu: "Why was she glaring at me?" *She turns to me, her voice tinged with annoyance.*

Okabe: "How should I know? Did you do something to make her angry?" *I reply, raising an eyebrow in question.*

Okabe: "Good work, everyone. With this, we can fight." *I announce, clapping my hands together in satisfaction.*

Kurisu: "Who are you fighting?" *She asks, her eyes narrowing in suspicion.*

Okabe: "SERN, and the system that rules the world." *I declare, striking a dramatic pose.*

Kurisu: "If that's what makes you happy..." *She mutters under her breath, rolling her eyes.*

Okabe: "Happy? I do not desire happiness. Have you forgotten? I am an insane mad scientist! What I desire is chaos. The time machine exists to bring chaos to the world. MUHAHAHAHA!" *I laugh maniacally, my eyes gleaming with excitement.*

Kurisu: "Never mind happiness. You're like a junkie hypersecreting beta endorphins." *She retorts, her voice dripping with sarcasm.*

Mayuri: "Okarin? I don't want you doing bad things, remember?" *She chides, her voice soft but firm.*

Itaru: "But wow! I can't believe you found one. You make the impossible look easy! That's why we love you! That's why we ad--"

Kurisu: "I certainly don't admire him." *She interjects, crossing her arms in front of her chest.*

Itaru: "...Eh?"

Okabe: "Eh?"

Kurisu: "Eh...?" *She blinks, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment.*
