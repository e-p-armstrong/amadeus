Okabe: "Quantum theory. The observer is an important element to the experiment." *I say, pacing around the room, my hands animatedly gesticulating to emphasize my point.*

Kurisu: "There were four of us here when the discharge phenomenon occurred last time. But before that, it occurred when Hashida-san was alone. Each time fractalization occurred, there were either two or three people observing. You and I each saw both phenomena. In other words, the conditions haven't changed." *She muses, her brows furrowed in deep thought.*

Okabe: "In that case..." *I trail off, my mind racing with possibilities.* 

Kurisu: "Hmmm..." *She murmurs, tapping her finger on the table in deep contemplation.*

Okabe: *Suddenly, I hear a rumbling sound from Kurisu's direction.* "Hungry?"

Kurisu: "Sh-shut up! I haven't eaten anything since lunch." *She retorts, blushing slightly as she glances at her watch.*

Okabe: "It's already 8?" *I ask, surprised at how late it has gotten.* "Just eat a banana. But only one of the two we just warmed. They are, after all, the fruit of our experiments. Or you could take something from our stock of cup noodles. Don't want any? Well, since you have lived in America for so long, I guess you'd prefer fast food instead--"

Kurisu: "Cup noodles." *She interrupts, her voice firm.*

Okabe: "What?" *I blink in surprise at her sudden decision.*

Kurisu: "I'll have cup noodles." *She repeats, her stomach rumbling once again.*

Okabe: "Cup noodles!?" *I exclaim, taken aback by her choice.*

Kurisu: "What flavors?" *She asks, already heading towards the cupboard.*

Okabe: "There's soy sauce flavor and chicken flavor." *I reply, watching her with amusement.*

Kurisu: "Chicken." *She decides, pulling out a cup noodle packet.*

Okabe: "Christina, is it okay to stay here this late? Perhaps you should contact your family." *I suggest, concerned about her wellbeing.*

Kurisu: "No need." *She dismisses, her attention focused on preparing her meal.*

Okabe: "What? Do your parents let you do whatever you want?" *I ask, surprised at her casual response.*

Kurisu: "I haven't seen my father in seven years. My mother is in America. I'm living in a hotel right now. Understand?" *She explains, her voice flat as she avoids my gaze.*

Okabe: "Wha...! You damn celebrity! If you're American, then you should at least use a motel instead of a hotel, right!?" *I blurt out, my confusion evident.*

Kurisu: "I'm not American, and there aren't any motels in the heart of Tokyo." *She retorts, rolling her eyes at my ignorance.*

Okabe: "What sort of hotel?" *I pry, my curiosity piqued.*

Kurisu: "What do you mean? It's a normal hotel in Ochanomizu." *She replies, sounding slightly annoyed.*

Okabe: "Ochanomizu? Then you can walk there from here, can't you?" *I ask, trying to understand her living situation.*

Kurisu: "Sure." *She admits, her tone indifferent.*

Okabe: "So, tell me about your father." *I inquire, feeling a bit bold.*

Kurisu: "Sorry?" *She looks up, clearly caught off guard.*

Okabe: "You said you haven't seen him in seven years?" *I press on, my curiosity getting the better of me.*

Kurisu: "Why do you care about my father?" *She asks defensively, her arms crossed.*

Okabe: "You're the one who mentioned him. Isn't that basically a hidden message saying 'please give me some advice about my father, please'?" *I tease, hoping to lighten the mood.*

Kurisu: "You're crazy." *She says, rolling her eyes but a small smile tugs at her lips.*
