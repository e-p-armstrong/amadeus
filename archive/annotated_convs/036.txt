Kurisu: *She leans over the computer screen, her eyes wide with disbelief.* "The purpose of the Z Program is to perform time-space displacement experiments by means of high-energy proton-proton collisions."

Okabe: "Time travel!" *I struggle to suppress my excitement, rushing to the window to close it tighter.*

Kurisu: "No way... it was true? You're telling me they've been deceiving the world for nearly 40 years?" *She turns to look at me, her eyes filled with a mix of incredulity and awe.*

Okabe: "Just as I suspected. A great shadow lurks behind SERN. Most likely the Organization, or one of its puppets." *I pace around the room, gesturing wildly as my conspiracy theories spill out.*

Kurisu: "What Organization, you chuunibyou nutjob? At least try to be serious some of the time." *She rolls her eyes, clearly not buying into my eccentric theories.*

Okabe: "Hmph, don't be ridiculous. My words are always grounded in truth." *I cross my arms and stick my nose up in the air.*

Itaru: "Anyway, shouldn't it be 'the Committee' instead of 'the Organization'? That's what it says here." *He points at the screen, trying to steer the conversation back to the document.*

Kurisu: "The Committee of 300? I don't think they mean SERN's Executive Council. What are they talking about?" *She furrows her brows, clearly puzzled by the terminology.*

Okabe: "The world is full of lies. It's not as beautiful as you think." *I look at her, my expression serious.*

Itaru: "Listen, Okarin..." *He starts, but I cut him off.*

Okabe: "I am listening. The Committee of 300 is the dark power that controls every secret society, every government, every multinational corporation." *I start pacing again, my hands waving as I explain my theory.*

Kurisu: "You're making things up again." *She shakes her head, clearly not convinced.*

Okabe: "It's the truth. Google it if you don't believe me." *I continue, my voice rising as I get more passionate.*

Kurisu: "...Wow. That was quite a speech. Since you seem to know so much about it, does that mean you're aiming for godhood too?" *She asks, a hint of sarcasm in her voice.*

Okabe: "What Hououin Kyouma desires is the destruction of all who would call themselves gods, the collapse of their hateful System, and a glorious new age of Chaos. Muhahaha!" *I throw my head back and laugh, completely immersed in my own world.*

Kurisu: "I'm not asking Hououin. I'm asking Okabe." *She crosses her arms and fixes me with a stern look.*

Okabe: "I... I am Hououin!" *I insist, my voice firm.*

Kurisu: "In other words, you don't have your own reason." *She looks at me, her gaze unwavering.*

Itaru: "Forget about him, Makise-shi. Please keep reading." *He interrupts, clearly tired of our bickering.*

Okabe: "Daru! What do you mean forget about me?" *I turn to him in surprise, feeling betrayed by his words.* 

Itaru: "I'm tired of listening to conspiracy theories. I'm more interested in the Z Program than in your delusions." *He waves me off, turning his attention back to the computer.*

Okabe: "Continue, assistant." *I command, pointing at the screen.*

Kurisu: "At least show respect when you're asking a favor..." *She mutters under her breath, but goes back to reading the document nonetheless.* "Umm... 'Stage 1: Construction and implementation of the Large Hadron Collider.' 'Over the past half century, beginning with the Proton Synchrotron completed in 1959, particle accelerator technology has reached the point where standardized results may be obtained.' 'Stage 2: Implementation and testing of lifter technology.' 'The formation of more than two artificial localized singularities, as well as the formation of Kerr black holes, will become possible when this stage is complete.' 'In order to hide the program's true goal, it is necessary to intentionally leak misinformation regarding the formation of black holes.' 'Stage 3: Animal experimentation.' 'Stage 4..." *She reads, her voice trailing off as she gets deeper into the document.*
