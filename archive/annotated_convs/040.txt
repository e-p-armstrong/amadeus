Kurisu: "It's almost the same. The same as Titor's theory. Basically... The LHC smashes protons together at 99. 9999991% the speed of light. By doing so, they compress a mass of 10kg into an extremely tiny space of 10m." *She speaks with authority, her hands moving as if molding the theory out of thin air.*

Itaru: "In Japanese please. Three lines max." *He interjects, scratching his head in confusion.*

Kurisu: "A small mass. Thrust into a narrow space. With great force." *She simplifies, her fingers coming together to indicate the compression.*

Itaru: "That explanation's too erotic!" *He blurts out, his laughter echoing in the room.*

Kurisu: "Huh? What part of it is erot-- ...Ah! H-Hashida, you pervert!!" *She blushes, her hands covering her mouth in surprise and embarrassment.*

Itaru: "Sounds like you have a pretty good imagination yourself." *He teases, pointing at her with a grin.*

Kurisu: "I-I'm not like you!" *She retorts, her cheeks still flushed.*

Okabe: "Don't listen to this fool, Christina. Continue." *I say, giving her an encouraging nod.*

Kurisu: "...ugh. Uh, what were we talking about?" *She asks, trying to regain her composure.*

Itaru: "Thrusting with great force." *He reminds, his grin widening.*

Okabe: "Proton compression." *I correct, trying to steer the conversation back on track.*

Kurisu: "Right. Successful compression generates a micro-singularity, which--" *She begins, only to be interrupted again.*

Itaru: "A micro singularity? Not a mini black hole?" *He asks, his brows furrowing in confusion.*

Okabe: "Same thing, essentially. A singularity is the core of a black hole." *I interject, hoping to clarify.*

Kurisu: "This process generates a black hole with two micro-singularities." *She continues, her tone steady and clear.*

Itaru: "Explain with cute girls." *He requests, leaning back in his chair.*

Kurisu: "Fine. Say there are two cute girls, Mic-chan and Cro-chan." *She concedes, her hands gesturing as if she's presenting the two imaginary girls.*

Itaru: "Sisters are moe. Haah, haah." *He comments, his eyes sparkling with amusement.*

Kurisu: "By feeding Mic-chan and Cro-chan electrons, you can make them do whatever you want." *She explains, her tone light but serious.*

Itaru: "Electric shock torture? This some sort of eroge?" *He asks, his laughter filling the room.*

Kurisu: "So you force them to rotate at an extremely high velocity. And then, theoretically, Mic-chan and Cro-chan transform into Magical Girl 'Ring Singularity'." *She continues, a hint of amusement in her voice.*

Itaru: "Cue stock transformation scene. Got it." *He nods, a satisfied grin on his face.*

Kurisu: "The resulting black hole exhibits what's called the Kerr effect." *She adds, trying to bring the conversation back to the science.*

Itaru: "What are Kerr black holes anyway? You said they spin, but what does that mean?" *He asks, his brow furrowed in concentration.*

Kurisu: "Exactly what it sounds like." *She replies, her gaze steady on him.*

Itaru: "But don't black holes usually spin? I mean, there's a whirlpool around the hole, right?" *He continues, his fingers twirling in a spiral motion.*

Kurisu: "The part that looks like it's spinning is just the surrounding matter being sucked into the black hole. A black hole is just a point where extreme mass causes gravitational collapse. Everything falls towards it. Since it's only a point, it doesn't spin.  A Kerr black hole has a ring at its center, not a point. Think of it like this. Once transformed into magical girls, Mic-chan and Cro-chan's hearts spin like a ring inside their bodies, which is impossible for normal people." *She explains, her hands moving as if painting a picture in the air.*

Itaru: "...I'll pass on the guro." *He says, leaning back in his chair, his hands raised in surrender.*

Okabe: "Before, you said that such a black hole's existence would be impossible to prove. What did you mean?" *I ask, leaning forward in interest.*

Kurisu: "A black hole has what's called an event horizon. Once you pass the event horizon, time and space switch places." *She explains, her gaze focused on me.*

Okabe: "Time and space switch places?" *I repeat, trying to understand.*

Kurisu: "Right now, we can move freely through space and into the future, but we can't move even one minute into the past. That becomes reversed. On the other side of the event horizon, moving freely through space becomes impossible, while moving freely through time becomes possible." *She clarifies, her tone patient and understanding.*

Okabe: *My brows furrow as I try to understand.* "I can't even imagine what that's like."

Kurisu: "Since unrestricted spatial movement is impossible, you can never escape a black hole. For example, if Okabe jumped into a black hole, time for him would stretch to infinity. Since light cannot escape, human eyes cannot see the other side of the event horizon. Observing a black hole from the outside is impossible, so nothing about the inside can be proven. There is an exception, however. This exception is vital when you use a Kerr black hole for time travel." *She continues, her voice steady and determined.*

Okabe: "Get to the point." *I urge, my hands clasped in front of me in anticipation.*

Kurisu: "The Kerr black hole's ring singularity. Since it's spinning, it has angular momentum." *She says, her gaze fixed on me.*

Itaru: "Like I said, in Japanese please." *He interjects, his tone light and teasing.*

Kurisu: "Didn't I already explain how the core spins? Just think of that as having momentum. If you keep giving Mic-chan and Cro-chan electrons, they'll rotate faster and faster. And when their angular momentum exceeds a certain threshold, the event horizon will disappear, and the singularity will become a naked singularity." *She concludes, her hands coming together as if showing the final piece of the puzzle.*
