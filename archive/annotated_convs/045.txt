Kurisu: *Glaring at me, she tries to comfort Mayuri who seems a bit lost in the discussion.*

Itaru: "I vote 'The Mail Who Leapt through Time'." *He grins, clearly proud of his movie reference.*

Okabe: "That's too stiff. It's hard to say." *I dismiss his suggestion with a wave of my hand.*

Itaru: "It's better than your 'Nostalagisticexpialidocious' nonsense! And mine makes a movie title referen--"

Okabe: "That's not cool. It needs to be cool." *I interrupt him, emphasizing my point with a firm gesture.*

Itaru: "You're rejecting it for that?" *He looks at me with an incredulous expression.*

Mayuri: "Tutturuâ™ª Mayushii has an idea! How about 'Back to the Mail'? I took a movie title, and changed a word to mail!" *She cheerfully proposes her own idea.*

Itaru: "I already did the movie joke, Mayu-shi." *He points out, a hint of amusement in his voice.*

Kurisu: "Besides, I think the meaning is a little off." *She adds, furrowing her brows.*

Mayuri: "It's not about the meaning... I took a movie title and changed a word to mail..." *She repeats, looking a bit disappointed.*

Okabe: "Either way, it's too long!" *I exclaim, throwing my hands up in frustration.*

Itaru: "Then how about DeLorean Mail?" *He tries again, grinning at his own wit.*

Okabe: "That doesn't even say what kind of email it is!" *I reject his suggestion again, shaking my head.*

Kurisu: "Hey. We don't have time for this nonsense. Let's just abbreviate it to 'D-Mail' and move on." *She interrupts, sounding completely done with our banter.*

Okabe: "But that's boring." *I protest, crossing my arms over my chest.*

Kurisu: "I don't care if it's boring." *She retorts, her gaze steady.*

Mayuri: "D-Mail it is!" *She declares, her voice filled with satisfaction.*

Itaru: "So why does the D-Mail phenomenon occur?" *He asks, turning the discussion back to the science.*

Okabe: "Because the path through the ring singularity is open. We've been over this already." *I explain, a bit impatiently.*

Kurisu: "We don't know if there's actually a black hole at work here. It could be an entirely different phenomenon that just happens to resemble SERN's experiments. It's dangerous to jump to conclusions." *She warns, her voice serious.*

Okabe: "Why so timid? Don't you want our time travel experiments to succeed? That's why we put our lives on the line to hack SERN! What we need to figure out is how to turn the PhoneWave (name subject to change) into a usable time machine." *I challenge her, my eyes burning with determination.*

Itaru: "Do you really think that's possible?" *He asks, sounding a bit skeptical.*

Okabe: "There is no think. Only do!" *I respond, striking a dramatic pose.*

Kurisu: "What, did you read that off a motivational poster? You're like the classic incompetent boss." *She teases, rolling her eyes.*

Okabe: "Damn you! You dare insult the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!?" *I retort, pointing an accusing finger at her.*

Itaru: "Well, it's not like Okarin's the boss anyway." *He chuckles, adding fuel to the fire.*

Okabe: "Indeed. I am the symbol of this lab, not the boss." *I clarify, my tone proud.*

Kurisu: "I don't know what you mean by symbol, but how do you plan to turn the PhoneWave into a time machine? Let's have details." *She demands, crossing her arms.*

Okabe: "My plan... alright, there is one thing. We've been thinking that the electrical discharge happens at random, but I have a hypothesis." *I start, checking my watch.*

Kurisu: "Which is?" *She prompts, leaning forward in interest.*

Okabe: "Recall the conditions when it occurred, Christina. We experimented through the night with no results, but there's one variable we overlooked. The simplest, most definitive variable of all. That is, the time of the occurrence." *I explain, my voice filled with conviction.*

Kurisu: "Let's try it right now!" *She exclaims, suddenly bursting with enthusiasm and rushing into the other room.*

Itaru: "Well, I'm glad to see she has her priorities straight." *He remarks, watching her leave with a bemused expression.*

Mayuri: "Mayushii's banana supply is getting low... gotta buy more." *She notes, her eyes on the lone banana.*

Kurisu: "Sorry, Mayuri-san. I'll go buy you some new bananas later." *She calls from the other room, her voice filled with determination.*
