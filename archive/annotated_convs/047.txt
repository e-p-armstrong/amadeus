 
Kurisu: "Pfft..." *She stifles a giggle, eyes dancing with amusement as she reads the mail she herself wrote.*
 
Okabe: "Christina. Did you send two mails?" *I ask, raising an eyebrow at the unexpected result of our experiment.*
 
Kurisu: "Eh? No. I only sent one." *She frowns, her curiosity piqued.*
 
Mayuri: "Mayushii saw it too. She really only sent one." *She chimes in, her voice holding a note of certainty.*
 
Okabe: "But I received two." *I insist, my confusion growing.*
 
Kurisu: "You're right... I even sent it in one sentence, but it got divided." *She mutters, her gaze fixed on the screen.*
 
Okabe: "By the way, what does this word mean?" *I question, pointing at the unfamiliar term on the screen.*
 
Kurisu: "Why don't you look it up?" *She suggests, her lips curving into a smirk.*
 
Itaru: "That reminds me. The D-Mail from before was cut up mid-sentence too." *He remarks, drawing our attention to an earlier experiment.*
 
Okabe: "Was it?" *I question, my interest piqued.*
 
Itaru: "Yeah. Look at your history. I'm pretty sure I sent 'Okarin's a perv'." *He says, grinning at the memory.*
 
Okabe: "You're right. This one got split too." *I confirm, my gaze hardening as I scrutinize the data.*
 
Kurisu: "I wonder what's causing it." *She muses, her brow furrowed in thought.*
 
Okabe: "Maybe it's related to the jellymen." *I suggest, a grimace tugging at my lips.*
 
Mayuri: "Um, Mayushii wants to know why it arrived five days ago." *She pipes up, her voice filled with innocent curiosity.*
 
Kurisu: "Good point. Didn't the last one also arrive five days before we sent it?" *She questions, turning to face me.*
 
Okabe: "Yeah. It did." *I respond, my gaze locked onto the screen.*
 
Itaru: "Is there some kind of rule for when it arrives?" *He wonders aloud, his fingers tapping rhythmically on the keyboard.*
 
Mayuri: "Let's try sending more!" *She suggests, clapping her hands in excitement.*
 
Okabe: "Alright, lab mems! Battle stations!" *I proclaim, rising from my chair with a determined expression.*
 
Kurisu: "He's at it again..." *She sighs, rolling her eyes in exasperation.*
 
Okabe: "Our mission: to send as many D-Mails as possible! Daru, man the X68000. Your job is to observe, adjust, and gather information on the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Assistant, keep those mails coming! Try various patterns of text. Japanese, English, full-width, half-width, emoticons. The actual messages don't matter." *I instruct, my voice booming in the small lab.*
 
Mayuri: "What about Mayushii?" *She asks, her eyes filled with anticipation.*
 
Okabe: "Your mission is to go shopping. Just buy some bananas for now. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall fund you!" *I declare, throwing a handful of coins at her.*
 
Mayuri: "Wow! You're so generousâ™ª" *She exclaims, catching the coins in her apron.*
 
Kurisu: "So I guess your job is opening the microwave." *She teases, a hint of a smile playing at her lips.*
 
Itaru: "Whoa! You saved the easiest job for yourself?" *He accuses, his grin widening.*
 
Okabe: "Heh. No, my assistant's judgment is sound. The key to a successful D-Mail is most likely the correct timing of opening the microwave door!" *I retort, placing a hand over my heart in mock sincerity.*
 
Kurisu: "Uh, I was just kidding." *She says, her eyes sparkling with amusement.*
 
Okabe: "MUHAHAHAHA! Leave this task to Hououin Kyouma! I shall open this door with precision, boldness, and delicacy, as if it were the flesh of a beautiful woman!" *I boast, puffing out my chest in pride.*
 
Mayuri: "Okarin, that's naughty!" *She giggles, a blush spreading across her cheeks.*
 
Okabe: "Furthermore, the current operation is top secret. You must not leak it to anyone. Got it?" *I warn, my gaze sweeping over each of them. Mayuri nods. The others are ignoring me.* Now I shall give this operation a name! It shall be known as Op-- *I am suddenly interrupted.*
 
Kurisu: "Don't need one. Let's start." *She interrupts, clearly eager to get on with the experiment.*
 
Okabe: "Wha... but..." *I stammer, my grand announcement thwarted.*
 
Kurisu: "Go ahead and rest. I'm gonna have a go at it a little longer." *She dismisses, her eyes already back on the screen, ready to solve the mystery of the D-Mail.*
