 

Okabe: "Today -- uhh, what day is it?" *I scratch my head, my eyes darting around the room as if trying to locate the date.*

Itaru: "August 2nd." *He states simply, not looking up from his laptop.*

Okabe: "August 2nd, 2010 is a date which will live in infamy!" *I slam my hand on the table, causing the various gadgets to rattle in response.* "For on this day, we, the Future Gadget Laboratory, have developed-- The first successful time machine in the history of mankind!"

Itaru: "It's not the first. SERN beat us." *He replies, his tone flat as he continues to stare at his screen.*

Kurisu: "And you can't even say we developed it. It happened by accident." *She interjects, crossing her arms over her chest and giving me a skeptical look.*

Okabe: "Hmph!" *I scoff, crossing my arms in mimicry of her.* "It seems that my assistant doesn't know the meaning of the word 'serendipity'. Penicillin, X-ray machines, dynamite -- these inventions and more were all born from coincidence!"

Kurisu: "I guess..." *She concedes, rolling her eyes at my flamboyant explanation.*

Mayuri: "But Chris-chan, you said before that time machines don't exist, right?" *She asks, her earnest eyes wide with confusion.* "But now you admit they do!"

Kurisu: "It's just that I have to admit it for now." *She explains, turning to face Mayuri with a soft smile.* "If we investigate how the PhoneWave works, it might turn out to be something that only seems like time travel."

Okabe: "Does nobody have any respect for my grand declaration!?" *I exclaim, throwing my hands up in exasperation.* "Don't complain if I take all the credit for inventing the first -- second, whatever -- time machine in human history! The 66th Round Table Conference ends here. Dismissed!"

Itaru: "Wait, that was a Round Table Conference? I didn't know that. And it's even the 66th." *He questions, finally looking up from his laptop with a puzzled expression.*

Kurisu: "Who cares what kind of table it is?" *She dismisses the argument with a wave of her hand.* "I'm gonna go back to my hotel, take a shower, and sleep." *With that, she pushes herself up from her chair and stretches, signaling the end of the meeting.*
