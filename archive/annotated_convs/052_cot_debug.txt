Okabe: "Kuh... I've gone soft. The old me would have killed her without a second thought." *I murmur to myself, eyeing Moeka who is standing right next to me.*

Moeka: "...Is it really a time machine?" *She asks tentatively, her gaze fixed on the equipment.*

Okabe: "Yes. You'll see. But you can't tell anyone. Okay?" *I turn to her, meeting her curious gaze with a stern one of my own.*

Moeka: *She nods in understanding, her expression serious.*

Itaru: "Alright, program complete." *He announces, his fingers finally leaving the keyboard.*

Kurisu: *Kurisu, who has been lying on the sofa engrossed in a technical manual, looks up.* "Then lets resume the experiments."

Mayuri: "But won't the manager scold us again?" *She asks, her voice carrying a hint of worry.*

Okabe: "Heh, don't worry." *I chuckle, brushing her concerns aside.* "Yesterday, I made this promise with Mister Braun. 'I swear there won't be any more shaking today.' In other words, the no-shaking promise only applied yesterday, so since today is yesterday's tomorrow, we can shake it all we want!"

Kurisu: "That doesn't settle anything. Why you're so confident is a mystery to me." *She retorts, raising an eyebrow at my convoluted explanation.*

Okabe: "In other words, Christina, you want me to erase Mister Braun." *I respond dramatically, my hand resting on my chin.*

Kurisu: "No! Besides, I don't think a wimp like you stands a chance against him." *She fires back, her tone carrying a hint of amusement despite her words.*
