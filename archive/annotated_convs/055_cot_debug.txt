Kurisu: "Now hold on! It's too dangerous! Are you trying to play god!?" *She steps forward, her eyebrows furrowed in concern.*

Okabe: "Oh? What's so dangerous about it?" *I tilt my head, feigning innocence.*

Kurisu: "Let's say you create a time paradox and blow up the world. What do you plan to do then?" *She crosses her arms, challenging me with her gaze.*

Okabe: "Well, I guess we'd be dead." *I shrug, my casual response contrasting sharply with her seriousness.*

Kurisu: "You're going to change the past so recklessly? Are you kidding me? Don't tell me... you're not seriously trying to bring chaos to the world or whatever, are you?" *She shakes her head in disbelief, her voice rising in pitch.*

Itaru: "Nah, he's all talk. It's fine to ignore him, Makise-shi." *He chuckles, leaning back in his chair.*

Kurisu: "R-really?" *She turns to Itaru, clearly hopeful for some reassurance.*

Mayuri: "Don't worry! Okarin's actually a very nice person. You'll see!" *She smiles at Kurisu, her words full of unwavering faith in me.*

Okabe: "I don't remember asking for an appraisal, but I'll answer Christina's question." *I wave my hand dismissively before leaning in closer to Kurisu.* "My dream is to plunge the world into chaos. However, it is still far too early to bring that dream to fruition. We can only send 36-byte emails. That's not enough for my purposes. Therefore, I shall set my ambition -- Project Chaotic -- aside for now."

Moeka: "Project... Chaotic?" *She whispers, her voice barely audible.*

Kurisu: "Did you just come up with that?" *She raises an eyebrow, her tone incredulous.*

Itaru: "Correct, Makise-shi!" *He gives a thumbs up, grinning broadly.*

Kurisu: "YES." *She pumps her fist triumphantly.*

Itaru: "Okarin just says the first thing that comes to mind. He's always like that." *He shrugs, his eyes twinkling with amusement.*

Okabe: "Don't analyze me, Daru! And you, assistant! Stop that fist pumping! You making fun of me!?" *I glare at them, my hands on my hips.*

Mayuri: "Um, so what are we going to do?" *She asks, looking around the room with a puzzled expression.*

Itaru: "Yeah. How do you want to change the past, anyway?" *He leans forward, resting his chin on his hand.*

Okabe: "First of all, the purpose of this experiment is to verify whether or not we can actually change the past. So it doesn't matter how trivial the change is." *I explain, gesturing broadly with my hands.*

Kurisu: "Have you heard of the Butterfly Effect?" *She interjects, her eyes sharp.*

Okabe: "Of course." *I nod, crossing my arms over my chest.*

Itaru: "Yeah, it's like that saying. 'When the wind blows, the bucket maker gains.'" *He adds, looking smug.*

Kurisu: "Eh? No, it's kinda like that, but kinda not..." *She shakes her head, looking a bit flustered.*

Okabe: "A butterfly flaps its wings in Beijing and a storm happens in New York, right?" *I clarify, looking at Kurisu expectantly.*

Kurisu: "Yeah, that. Part of Chaos Theory. Basically, any change, no matter how small, could have a significant effect on the future. How do you plan to take responsibility for that?" *She asks, her voice steady and firm.*

Okabe: "Titor said that the many-worlds interpretation holds true." *I counter, my tone defiant.*

Kurisu: "And that makes it okay to change the past? You're going to believe that self-proclaimed time traveler's delusions?" *She scoffs, her eyes flashing with irritation.*

Okabe: "Can you prove they're delusions?" *I challenge, meeting her gaze.*

Kurisu: "I'm asking what you're going to do if they are. How are you going to deal with the consequences?" *She retorts, her gaze unyielding.*

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, attempting to calm myself down.* "Christina, you said this before, did you not? When hypotheses pile up, and theories are verified, they become reality. That's how modern physics comes to understand the truth of the universe. You're contradicting yourself."

Kurisu: "No, I'm not. We don't even have a hypothesis for how the PhoneWave works. We're just fumbling around in the dark here. There are still too many risks to try changing the past. We should wait until we know more." *She insists, her hands clenching into fists.*

Okabe: "You're actually itching to try it out, aren't you?" *I tease, a smirk playing on my lips.*

Kurisu: "W-well..." *She quickly looks away, her cheeks turning a faint pink.*

Okabe: "Besides, didn't you want to prove that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) isn't a time machine? If it's not a time machine, then it can't change the past. You could prove yourself right, so why are you against it?" *I press on, leaning in closer to her.*

Kurisu: "Oh shut up..." *She mutters, avoiding my gaze.*

Okabe: "And if you're going to talk about time paradoxes, then what about SERN? They've already sent more than 100 people to the past. Surely a few paradoxes have happened by now." *I argue, my voice filled with determination.*

Kurisu: "So you want to stoop to the same level as the guys that did those inhumane experiments?" *She retorts, her voice laced with disgust.*
