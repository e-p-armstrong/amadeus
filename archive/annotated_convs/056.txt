Mayuri: *Suddenly, she raises her hand, interrupting the discussion.* "Um, Okarin? Mayushii doesn't really get it, but what are you going to change?"

Okabe: *I fold my arms, a mischievous grin spreading across my face.* "My goal for this operation is simple. We, my friends... Are going to win the lottery!"

Itaru: "I'm for it. If we win the lottery, I can buy all the computer parts I want and go to MayQueen for every meal of the day. We'd be stupid not to try it." *He chimes in, rubbing his hands together at the thought of his potential riches.*

Mayuri: "Money? Okarin... that makes Mayushii sad. We should do something that will bring peace to the world! Like what if we give everybody in the whole wide world an Upa cushion?" *She tilts her head, her eyes sparkling with innocent hope.*

Okabe: "Hmph. Peace, you say? Don't be ridiculous. I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyo--"

Kurisu: *She interrupts me with a scoff.* "And here I thought you had ambition."

Okabe: *I shrug, undeterred by her comment.* "Don't get me wrong. This isn't about world peace and it isn't about ambition. It's about discovering whether or not we can change the past. The easiest way to do that is to see if we can win the lottery, right?"

Kurisu: "But your primary goal is the money, isn't it?"

Okabe: *I chuckle, leaning back in my chair.* "With that kind of money, I could say goodbye to this rickety old building! Muhahaha! I could get an office in Daibiru or UPX!"

Kurisu: "See? Just like I thought."

Okabe: "I won't whitewash it. If we moved, we could experiment as much as we want without fear of Mister Braun. If we had money, we could build the Future Gadgets of our dreams. And of course, we could buy a truckload of Mayuri's favorite bananas."

Mayuri: "A t-truckload?" *She gasps, her eyes wide with disbelief.*

Kurisu: "No, Mayuri-san! Don't let him tempt you!" *She quickly interjects, trying to bring Mayuri back to reality.*

Okabe: *I wave my hand dismissively at Kurisu.* "Shut it, Celeb Seventeen!"

Kurisu: "S-se...? Serendipity?"

Okabe: "Celeb. Seventeen."

Kurisu: *She frowns, clearly confused.* "What the hell is that supposed to mean!?"

Okabe: "You live in a hotel off of your parents' money. You could never understand the plight of poor students like us." *I retort, pointing an accusing finger at her.*

Kurisu: *She looks to Moeka, trying to change the subject.* "What do you think, Moeka-san?"

Okabe: "If you're going to complain, then suggest an alternative. A change to the past that would be both trivial and easy to understand. Got anything?" *I challenge, leaning forward in anticipation.*

Kurisu: "Um... Let's try changing the hotel I'm staying at." *She suggests, albeit hesitantly.*

Okabe: "How are we supposed to know the difference? If you want to stay in Uguisudani, do it on your own. That should be easy for a Celeb Seventeen like you."

Kurisu: "Do you have to say it like that?" *She winces, clearly not enjoying the nickname.*

Itaru: "Anyway, why Uguisudani?"

Okabe: "Because that's where all the love hotels ar--"

Kurisu: *She quickly interrupts, her face turning red.* "One more word out of you and I excise your frontal lobe with a rusty scalpel."
