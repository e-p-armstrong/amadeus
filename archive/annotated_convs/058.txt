Okabe: "W-wait! 1st prize is too much!" *I exclaim, my eyes widening as I glance at the contest flyer.*

Itaru: "Why?" *He asks, tilting his head in confusion.* 

Kurisu: "That is an awful lot of money... hahaha..." *She chuckles, her eyes sparkling with amusement.*

Okabe: "No, not that. 1st place would be... too conspicuous." *I shake my head, my expression turning serious.*

Kurisu: "What?" *She raises an eyebrow, clearly puzzled by my logic.*

Okabe: "Don't you get it!? I'm being chased by the Organization. If we win 1st prize, the media will cover the event and my cover will be blown!" *I gesture frantically, my gaze darting around the room as if expecting enemy agents to appear at any moment.*

Kurisu: "That's stupid." *She crosses her arms, her face showing clear disbelief.*

Mayuri: "What if Mayushii wins?" *She asks innocently, her eyes wide with curiosity.*

Okabe: "No. Stage Two of Operation Urd does have its risks, just like Celeb Sev said." *I shake my head vigorously, my gaze meeting Kurisu's.*

Kurisu: "Celeb... Sev? Don't abbreviate it." *She frowns, clearly frustrated by my nickname for her.*

Okabe: "I'll be the winner. That way, I shoulder all of the risk." *I stand tall, trying to project confidence.*

Kurisu: "And all of the money, right? I see your plan." *She smirks, her eyes narrowing in suspicion.*

Okabe: "Anyway, we should aim a little lower. Daru, how much is 2nd prize?" *I dismiss her remark with a wave of my hand, turning to Itaru.*

Itaru: "Umm, looks like it was... 23 million yen." *He squints at the flyer, reading off the prize amount.*

Okabe: "...L-let's try 3rd prize." *I stammer, my mind racing as I consider the implications.*

Itaru: "That was only 700, 000 yen." *He shrugs, clearly indifferent to my paranoia.*

Okabe: "Yeah, that's good. That should be about right." *I nod, trying to reassure myself as much as the others.*

Kurisu: "You're such a chicken." *She chuckles, shaking her head at my antics.*

Okabe: "Heh, heh heh heh! That's rich, coming from the one who was so worried about the risk of time paradoxes. Eh, Celeb Sev!?" *I laugh, enjoying the irony of her statement.*

Kurisu: "I'm begging you, stop calling me that. I'll settle for assistant. And don't misunderstand. I'm still worried about what could go wrong." *She sighs, her face showing a mix of frustration and worry.*

Okabe: "I'm trying to minimize our risk by choosing an amount that's just right. Stop being so stubborn." *I argue, my gaze meeting hers in a silent challenge.*

Kurisu: "...No, you." *She retorts, her expression defiant.*
