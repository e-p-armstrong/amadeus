Okabe: "30 seconds? Really?" *I question, my brows furrowed in confusion.*

Mayuri: "Yup. You suddenly ran over to the PhoneWave, then you took out your phone and started going 'haaah haaah!" *She explains with a wide-eyed look of surprise.*

Itaru: "Say that again, Mayushii." *He calls out from the lounge.*

Mayuri: "Huh? You started going haah haah?" *She repeats, her voice rising in pitch.*

Itaru: "The haah haah part!" *He insists, amusement evident in his tone.*

Mayuri: "Haah haah!" *She echoes dutifully, her voice carrying a playful undertone.*

Itaru: "More sexy this time!" 

Kurisu: "Stop it, perv." *She scolds, her arms crossed in a show of disapproval.*

Okabe: "Th-that's right, the mail!" *I quickly check my mail.*

Okabe: "The mail arrived a week ago." *I exclaim, my eyes wide with realization.*

Mayuri: "Hm? What's going on?" *She asks, her head tilted in confusion.*

Okabe: "The money! Did I win the LOTO SIX?" *I question, my gaze darting between the others.*

Okabe: "Hey, Celeb Sev, did I win 3rd place?" *I turn to Kurisu, my voice filled with anticipation.*

Kurisu: "Don't call me Celeb Sev! And 3rd place of what?" *She retorts, her arms still crossed.*

Okabe: "...what?" *I approach Kurisu, a feeling of disconnect washing over me.*

Okabe: "What did you say just now?" *I question, my voice hardening.*

Kurisu: "Wh-what?" *She stammers, taken aback by my sudden intensity.*

Okabe: "What the hell did you say just now!?" *I demand, my voice rising in volume.*

Kurisu: "Got a problem? I asked what, and then you just--" *She glares back at me, confusion evident in her expression.*

Okabe: "Not that! You said '3rd place of what', right!? I mean 3rd place of LOTO SIX!" *I clarify, my voice filled with frustration.*

Kurisu: "What?" *She gives me a puzzled look, her brows furrowed in confusion.*

Okabe: "Daru! I sent myself the winning LOTO SIX numbers just now. Didn't I?" *I turn to Daru, my eyes pleading for confirmation.*

Itaru: "Holy crap! That's brilliant, man! We can use D-Mails to make ourselves billionaires!" *His eyes light up with excitement.*

Okabe: "Mayuri, you were gonna buy a truckload of bananas... right?" *I question, my gaze drifting to Mayuri.*

Mayuri: "A truckload? Who's gonna fill it up?" *She asks, her voice filled with innocent curiosity.*

Okabe: "Wait! What happened to stage two of Operation Urd!?" *I exclaim, panic seeping into my voice.*

Kurisu: "By stage two, you mean an experiment to see if we can change the past, right?" *She questions, her tone analytical.*

Okabe: "R-right! That's it!" *I confirm, relief washing over me.*

Itaru: "Yeah, that's why we're all thinking." *He agrees, his tone thoughtful.*

Okabe: "What?" *I question, my brows furrowed in confusion.*

Mayuri: "About what to send, so we can tell if the past has changed." *She clarifies, her voice gentle.*

Itaru: "I think we should definitely go with Okarin's LOTO SIX idea." *He proposes, his eyes gleaming with excitement.*

Mayuri: "Mayushii thinks we shouldn't be so greedy for dough. Ah, but when I say dough, I don't mean like for baking." *She chimes in, her voice filled with warmth.*

Kurisu: "I think we all know what you mean." *She says, a hint of amusement in her tone.*
