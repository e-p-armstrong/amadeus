Nae: *Her eyes widen in admiration as she clings to Suzuha's waist.* "Eh?"

Suzuha: "That's how people talk when they've been brainwashed, Nae." *She says, casting a playful glance at Okabe.*

Okabe: "Nonsense, Part-Time Warrior." *I cross my arms, meeting Suzuha's gaze with a defiant one of my own.* "My brain has not been washed since the day I was born."

Nae: "Are you a liar, Mister Okarin?" *She asks, her innocent gaze fixed on me.*

Okabe: "Don't call me that!" *I exclaim, my outburst causing Nae to startle.*

Suzuha: "You shouldn't yell at children. Look, she's shaking." *She chastises me, pointing at the visibly startled Nae.*

Okabe: *I sigh, realizing the error of my reaction.* 'Mister' makes me sound old. I'm not even old enough to drink yet... what a disgrace. No, there's no point getting angry at a child. I need to show composure as an adult.

Kurisu: "You're even more of a perv than Okabe!" *She declares, pointing an accusing finger at Itaru.* "I'm not using '-san' for you any more!"

Itaru: "I'm not a perv! I'm a pervy gentleman!" *He protests, striking a mock-offended pose.*

Kurisu: "What does that even mean!?" *She asks, throwing her hands up in exasperation.*
