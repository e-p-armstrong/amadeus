Okabe: *I glance at Kurisu, who is hiding her face in her book.* "John Titor is a fraud!" *I scream, slamming my fist on the table and startling both of my colleagues.*

Itaru: "Um, Makise-shi? What the hell happened to Okarin?" *He asks, looking to Kurisu for answers.*

Kurisu: "Beats me. A few hours ago, he was exchanging emails with John Titor, and then he suddenly got quiet. And then he started ranting. He's been like this for half an hour." *She closes her book and stares at me, her brows furrowed in concern.*

Itaru: "He's been acting strange all day, don't you think?" *He asks, glancing at Kurisu for validation.*

Kurisu: "Agreed." *She nods, watching me with a cautious gaze.*

Okabe: "Listen up, lab mems! It's time to resume Operation Urd!" *I announce, standing up abruptly and pacing around the room.*

Itaru: "Seriously? The manager's still downstairs, you know?" *He glances at the clock on the wall, his brows furrowed.*

Okabe: "Fret not. It's almost closing time for the Braun Tube Workshop." *I wave off his concern, my eyes focused on the experiment at hand.*

Kurisu: "The PhoneWave doesn't work at night, remember?" *She raises an eyebrow at me, her tone flat and matter-of-fact.*

Okabe: "It's worth a try! We need to figure out how late the PhoneWave (name subject to change) works. At the same time, I want to see if the two of you can use D-Mails to change the past." *I insist, turning back to face them.*

Itaru: "Change the past...!" *His eyes widen in shock, clearly taken aback by the idea.*

Okabe: "Change the past to your liking. As long as it's something easy to observe." *I say as I finish the preparations for the PhoneWave (name subject to change), my attention already back on the device.*

Kurisu: "I'm going back to my hotel. Show me your report on today's experiment tomorrow." *She sighs heavily, gathering her things and leaving the lab without another word.*
