Okabe: "Yes, but I'm starting to doubt whether he can be trusted." *I say, skepticism clear in my voice.*

Suzuha: "What!? Why!? What went wrong!?" *She exclaims, her brows furrowed in deep concern.*

Okabe: "Oh, you're a Titor otaku," *I observe, my lips curling into a knowing smile.*

Mayuri: "Look, it's Chris-chan!" *She leans out the window, waving enthusiastically at the approaching figure.*

Okabe: *Following Mayuri's gaze, I spot Kurisu. I can't help but glance at Suzuha, knowing her aversion to the scientist. Her expression hardens as she silently glares at Kurisu.*

Kurisu: *Kurisu, not one to back down, meets Suzuha's glare with equal intensity. A moment of tense silence follows before Kurisu breaks away and heads towards the lab.*

Mayuri: "Chris-chan, tutturuâ™ª" *She sings out in greeting as Kurisu enters.*

Kurisu: "Good morning." *She responds, her gaze lingering on Suzuha before turning to me.*

Okabe: "What did you say to the part-timer downstairs?" *I ask, curiosity piqued.*

Kurisu: "Nothing much. I told her if she wanted to say something, she should just say it." *She shrugs dismissively, as if the intense stare-down was a normal occurrence.*

Okabe: "What did she say?" *I prod further, trying to understand the tension between the two women.*

Kurisu: "Nothing. She just groaned. I wonder what's wrong with her." *She muses, her brow furrowed in thought.*

Itaru: *Suddenly, he bursts into the lab, his eyes wide with excitement.* "She's jealous of Makise-shi's popularity, duh!"

Kurisu: "If she wants my lab mem number, she can have it." *She states, clearly unbothered by Itaru's outburst.*

Okabe: "What!? The lab mem number you carry is the highest credential a scientist could hope to achieve! They sell for millions on the black market, but you would give it away!?" *I exclaim, shocked at her nonchalance.*

Kurisu: "It's not exactly a counterfeit passport. Also, shut up." *She retorts, rolling her eyes at my dramatic reaction.*
