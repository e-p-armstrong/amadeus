Okabe: "For what? I don't think you're selfish. In fact, I'm grateful for your offer." *I reassure her, then guide everyone into the lab.* "Listen up, everyone!" *I command their attention and explain Moeka's situation.*

Mayuri: "I think it's a good idea! Moeka-san is a lab mem too!" *She exclaims, clapping her hands together in excitement.*

Itaru: "So, what sorta mail does Kiryu-shi plan to send?" *He asks, adjusting his glasses.*

Okabe: "My request is that its contents be simple and easy to measure, so that we can confirm whether or not the past changes." *I explain, then glance suspiciously at a new mail on my phone.* "A secret? What do you mean?"

Kurisu: "What's going on?" *She asks, trying to peek at my phone from beside me.*

Okabe: "No, that's not the problem." *I dismiss her question, hiding the screen from her view.*

Kurisu: "Hmmm, I see. I understand how you feel, but since this is an experiment, data collection should take priority." *She concludes after finally getting a look at my phone.*

Okabe: "Oh? We agree for once, assistant." *I smirk, enjoying this rare agreement.*

Kurisu: "I-I'm not agreeing with you, exactly. If we don't collect data, then we'll never figure out how the PhoneWave works." *She retorts, blushing slightly.*

Mayuri: "But girls have lots of secrets, you know? You shouldn't ask her to tell her secrets, Okarin. That's perverted!" *She scolds me, wagging her finger.*

Itaru: "Whoa! Is that where we're going with this!?" *He exclaims, his eyes wide with shock.*

Okabe: "Calm down, Daru!" *I raise my hands in a calming gesture, then turn to Mayuri and Moeka.* "We're not asking you to send something private."

Kurisu: "Even if you want to send something private, you shouldn't for now. We still don't know how this thing handles paradoxes, so we need to be extremely careful." *She adds, nodding firmly at my words.*

Moeka: "...Nothing private?" *She asks, her voice barely above a whisper.*

Kurisu: "Nothing you want to keep secret, at least. Even if you mean well, the mail's content might have a serious effect on the timeline. You should show your mail to a third party and have them check if the content is problematic or not." *She explains, her gaze stern.*

Okabe: "Indeed. My assistant said everything I wanted to say. I will add only that the experiment must go on!" *I proclaim, holding my hand high*

Kurisu: "...I wasn't speaking for you. Don't misunderstand." *She retorts, crossing her arms.*

Okabe: *I huff, annoyed at her cheekiness.*

Kurisu: "Experiments prioritize data over privacy in the first place. If you're going to be a test subject, you need to be prepared for that." *She says, her tone serious and unyielding.*

Mayuri: "Really? Mayushii wasn't prepared for that... I'm sorry, Chris-chan..." *She apologizes, her shoulders drooping.*

Kurisu: "You don't have to apologize. I'm not criticizing you. It's just how these things work." *She reassures Mayuri, offering her a gentle smile.*
