Okabe: "So, Finger." *I turn to Moeka, an amused smile playing on my lips.*

Mayuri: "Um, why do you call Moeka-san 'Finger'?" *She tilts her head to the side, a look of genuine confusion on her face.*

Okabe: "That's the name of her esper power. Kiryu Moeka, I dub thee Shining Finger! Use this name with pride." *I proudly declare, striking a dramatic pose.*

Moeka: *She shakes her head expressionlessly, clearly not sharing my enthusiasm.*

Okabe: "What? You don't like it? But it's such a cool name. What's the problem!?" *I cross my arms, feigning offence.*

Mayuri: "Moeka-san is Moeka-san. Her fingers don't shine or anything..." *She states matter-of-factly, completely missing the point.*

Itaru: "Don't feed the trolls, Mayu-shi." *He advises, looking up from his computer screen.*

Okabe: "I'm not trolling, just naming her power." *I defend myself, trying to maintain a serious demeanor.*

Kurisu: "Cut the chatter and get started." *She interrupts, her voice clear and commanding.*

Itaru: "What if the manager says something?" *He asks, sounding a bit worried.*

Okabe: "Muhahaha! Don't be afraid of Mister Braun! If he storms in yelling, I'll kick him to the curb!" *I declare, puffing out my chest in defiance.*

Itaru: "Seriously? Okarin, you're so cool! That's why we love you!" *He exclaims, grinning widely.*

Kurisu: "He's just talk." *She mutters under her breath, rolling her eyes.*

Okabe: "PhoneWave (name subject to change), activate!" *I announce, pressing the start button with a flourish.*

Okabe: *I glance at Moeka. She nods grimly, an unusual show of emotion. And then, she presses the button. The world twists into unrecognizable shapes. The floor is shaking. Or is it me? My vision blurs and loses color.* "Guh!!"

Okabe: *The world lurches. I struggle to keep my balance. As I brace myself against further shaking, I try to analyze what I'm experiencing.* "Where's Shining Finger? Where'd she go?"

Kurisu: *She turns to me, looking puzzled.* "Shining what?"

Itaru: "Okarin. Japanese please." *He chuckles, completely oblivious to the situation.*

Okabe: *I search the entire lab, but Moeka is nowhere to be found. Panic begins to set in.* "Where's Kiryu Moeka? She was here just now, wasn't she!?" *I grab Mayuri's shoulders and shake her, desperate for answers.*

Mayuri: "Uhwhaaa? Whoooo?" *She stammers, clearly shocked by my sudden outburst.*

Okabe: "Kiryu Moeka!" *I repeat, my voice rising in panic.*

Itaru: *He looks at me, completely confused.* "Who's that?"

Kurisu: *She shakes her head, looking just as puzzled as the others.* "Never heard of her."
