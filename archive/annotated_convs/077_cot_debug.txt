Kurisu: "Did it happen again, Okabe?" *She asks, her brows furrowed in concern.*

Okabe: "What do you mean, 'again'?" *I reply, confusion evident in my voice.*

Kurisu: "Something like this happened yesterday. You remembered something we didn't. Uh, what did you call it? Oh yeah, Reading Steiner." *She muses, trying to recall our previous discussions.*

Okabe: *I nod, my hands clenched in my pockets.* "Yes, that's the name I gave this phenomenon -- or rather, my ability to perceive it." *I quickly send an urgent email to Moeka, my fingers trembling slightly as I type.*

Mayuri: "Are you okay? You're really pale." *She asks, her voice filled with worry.*

Okabe: "Y-yeah... I'm fine." *I lie, forcing a smile on my face.*

Okabe: "...Assistant, how much do you remember about the experiment we just did?" *I ask, my eyes never leaving my phone screen.*

Kurisu: "I don't remember doing any experiments today. You sent a D-Mail just now, didn't you?" *She replies, her expression thoughtful.*

Okabe: "...Yeah. But things are different from yesterday. I didn't send the D-Mail. Kiryu Moeka did." *I say, my voice barely above a whisper.* *I start scrolling through my phone's history, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Okabe: *I swallow hard, a chill running down my spine.* "Christina. Let's say a D-Mail caused a time paradox. What would happen?"

Kurisu: "...I don't know. No one has experienced a time paradox, after all." *She shrugs, her eyes focused on me.*

Okabe: "But before, didn't you say something like the world would disappear?" *I ask, my voice shaky.*

Kurisu: "All I said was that was one theory. Maybe nothing happens, and like in a certain movie, history gets amended to accommodate the paradox. According to Dr. Hawking's chronology protection conjecture, it's impossible to do anything that might cause a time paradox in the first place." *She explains, her tone clinical.*
