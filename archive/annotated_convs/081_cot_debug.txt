Okabe: *Ignoring Daru, my attention is drawn to Luka, who nervously clasps his hands to his mouth, his eyes cast down.* 

Luka: "I want... to be a girl."

Kurisu: *Kurisu is the first to react, her brows knitting in confusion.* "...What?"

Okabe: *I choke on my laughter, taken aback by Luka's unexpected confession.* 

Luka: "I don't really... like how I look... I always thought... that if I were a girl... I could be a little more confident..."

Kurisu: "Wait. Wait a second." *She holds up a hand, rubbing her temples as she tries to process the information.*

Okabe: "Heh, heh, heh. Assistant mine -- no, Christina!"

Kurisu: "I'm not your assistant, and I'm not Christina!" *She retorts, her hands on her hips.*

Okabe: "You've made a grave error!"

Kurisu: "I have?" *She raises a skeptical eyebrow.*

Okabe: "Don't you understand? No, of course you don't. How could you, with impure thoughts clouding your eyes!"

Kurisu: "Wh-what do you mean?" *She stammers, taken aback by my accusation.*

Okabe: "Allow me to explain. You called Lukako here a 'weak and innocent girl.' But he's not a girl at all. He's a guy!"

Kurisu: "Is that some kind of joke?" *She crosses her arms, looking skeptical.*

Okabe: "It's not a joke, but the naked truth as described in the Akashic Records! Muhahaha!" *I throw my head back, laughing dramatically.*

Kurisu: *She looks from Daru to Mayuri, seeking validation, but they only nod.* "...Are you guys trolling me?"

Okabe: "Eh?"

Itaru: "Eh?"

Kurisu: *She suddenly turns to Luka, her face serious.* "...Eh?"

Kurisu: "Is what Okabe says true?"

Luka: "Y-yes... I'm... a guy..." *Luka stammers, his face flushing.*

Kurisu: "N-no way! Someone this cute can't be a boy!" *She raises her hands in disbelief.*

Itaru: "You've got it backwards. You're supposed to say 'Someone this cute can't be a girl.'"

Kurisu: "That's not what I meant." *She shakes her head, looking flustered.*

Okabe: "Lukako. You're fine just the way you are. I will not reject you, be you man or be you woman. Nor will anyone else here. And I will not deny your wish. Nor will anyone else here."

Itaru: "Why do you keep repeating that last part?" *He asks, looking puzzled.*

Kurisu: *She starts touching her own face, checking her hair in her pocket mirror.* 

Okabe: "Why, Christina. Is it such a shock to meet a man far more feminine than you?"

Kurisu: "I admit it. Compared to her... I mean, to him, I'm not as cute, I talk more rudely, and my attitude is worse... This is a three-day-coma level shock." *She admits, looking genuinely upset.*

Mayuri: "Chris-chan's cute tooâ™ª" *She reassures Kurisu with a gentle smile.*

Kurisu: "Don't try to comfort me. It just makes me feel worse." *She waves away Mayuri's words, looking more dejected.*

Okabe: "Admitting your faults is the first step towards becoming stronger. You may one day become a splendid woman, Christina. You're still young."

Kurisu: "Who the hell asked you?" *She snaps, her patience wearing thin.*

Okabe: "I take it back! You're a stubborn fool who refuses to face the truth!"

Kurisu: "Shut up. I don't want to hear that from you." *She turns away, crossing her arms.*

Luka: "Um... sorry. I shouldn't have said anything." *He murmurs, his eyes welling up with tears.*

Okabe: *Seeing Luka's distress, I exchange a glance with Kurisu, and we stop arguing.*

Itaru: "Welp, better get my trusty digicam..." *He reaches for his camera, his eyes gleaming with mischief.*

Kurisu: "Don't try to sneak in a photo session, you perv!" *She warns, her eyes narrowing.*
