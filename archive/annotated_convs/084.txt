Kurisu: "Ah..." *She looks thoughtful, tapping her chin as she tries to come up with an idea.*

Itaru: *He quickly types something into his computer.* "Around 1996. There wasn't mail until later, though."

Okabe: *I frown, crossing my arms over my chest.* "So the year Lukako was born, most people still didn't have cellphones. Lukako's mother may not have had one. In that case, she might not be able to receive the D-Mail!"

Mayuri: *Her face lights up with understanding.* "Oh! I get it!"

Luka: *He looks at me with confusion and worry.* "Eh...? We can't do it?"

Itaru: *He shrugs, looking at the group with a hopeful expression.* "What about modifying it to send crazy waves or something?"

Kurisu: *She gives him a suspicious look.* "What the hell are crazy waves?"

Itaru: *He grins, leaning back in his chair.* "Waves that only crazy girls can pick up. You know, girls who always talk about stuff no one understands. It's pretty moe."

Kurisu: *She rolls her eyes, clearly not impressed.* "I'll microwave your brain if you don't shut up."

Itaru: *He laughs, clearly enjoying the banter.* "Yes! Abuse me more, please!"

Mayuri: *She tilts her head, looking thoughtful.* "Um, couldn't you put a letter in a time capsule and bury it?"

Kurisu: *She shakes her head, trying to keep the discussion focused.* "That would go to the future, not the past."

Mayuri: *She looks disappointed.* "Oh..."

Itaru: *He suddenly perks up.* "I know! How about that thing where you get struck by lightning and that turns you into a girl! Like in old comics and anime."

Kurisu: *She sighs, pinching the bridge of her nose.* "There's no point to the experiment if we don't use D-Mail. Don't lose sight of the objective."

Mayuri: *She looks at Kurisu with a hopeful smile.* "We're counting on you for a nice idea, Chris-chanâ™ª"

Kurisu: "M-me? I..." *She stammers, clearly taken aback.* "We could... build a rocket which exceeds the speed of light squared, then that immense speed would reverse the flow of time, or something..."

Itaru: *He shakes his head, his tone teasing.* "You're forgetting about the PhoneWave too."

Okabe: *I cross my arms, a smug smirk on my face.* "Furthermore, genius girl, you just contradicted relativity."

Kurisu: *She blushes, looking slightly embarrassed.* "It was just a joke. Don't take it seriously."

Okabe: *I shake my head, looking at the group with disappointment.* "Useless, all of you! This lab is a disgrace!"

Kurisu: *She gives me a challenging look.* "Fine then. Let's hear from Hououin Kyouma, the insane mad scientist with an IQ over 170 whose brain cells are coveted the world over. What's your genius plan?"
