Okabe: "Why do you want her to like meat!?" *I question, a puzzled expression on my face.*

Mayuri: "That's not it!" *Mayuri quickly interjects, waving her hands dismissively.* "If you keep repeating 'MEAT', then she'll actually start to hate meat and want to eat vegetables instead, don't you think?"

Itaru: "Yeah... no." *Itaru shakes his head, clearly not convinced by Mayuri's logic.*

Luka: *While we continue our playful banter, Luka completes his composition.* "How about something like this? 'MOM EAT VEGGIES OK'"

Itaru: "Isn't that a little too vague?" *He leans back, a thoughtful look on his face.*

Okabe: "And the first 'MOM' should go." *I suggest, pointing at the message.* "That'll just make it harder to believe."

Luka: "Then... 'EAT LOTS OF VEGGIES TO GIVE BIRTH TO A GIRL'." *Luka offers another suggestion, his voice filled with uncertainty.*

Kurisu: "That's a little too direct." *She says, her eyes narrowing in thought.* "And it's over the character limit."

Luka: "'EAT VEGGIES FOR HEALTHY KID'" *Luka proposes, looking at each of us for approval.*

Itaru: "Wait a sec." *Itaru pulls out a conversion chart, his eyes scanning the document.* "According to this conversion chart, it looks like you gotta use two more numbers for voiced consonants. So that sentence is four bytes over."

Okabe: "Then a little modification." *I lean forward, a spark of inspiration in my eyes.* "How about 'EAT VEG 4 HEALTHY KID'?"

Kurisu: "Isn't that a little too informal?" *She raises an eyebrow, looking skeptically at my suggestion.* "You're talking to Urushibara-san's mother, you know? Would she understand the 'VEG 4' part?"
