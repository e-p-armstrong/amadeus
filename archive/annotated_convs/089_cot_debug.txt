Kurisu: "Shut up. Don't talk to me." *She states firmly, crossing her arms defensively and avoiding eye contact.*

Okabe: *I look at her, my eyes softened with concern.* "Listen. You don't have to talk. Just listen. If there's something troubling you, I'll do everything in my power to help."

Kurisu: "...Eh?" *She finally meets my gaze, her eyes wide with surprise.*

Okabe: "And it's not just me. I'm sure I speak for Mayuri and Daru as well." *I assure her, my tone sincere.* "So don't hesitate to come to us. When you want to cry, don't hold it in. Just let it out. We won't reject you. We'll hear you out."

Kurisu: "Why..." *She looks at me, her expression a mixture of confusion and disbelief.*

Okabe: "Because you're important to us. You're our friend." *I tell her, my words resolute.*

Kurisu: "Ah... yeah..." *She blushes, hanging her head slightly.*

Okabe: *Seeing her reaction, I gently pat her shoulder.* 

Kurisu: *She suddenly hugs her Upa plushie tightly, causing its face to cave in.* "...I'm sorry. I was a little upset."

Okabe: "You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. Just tell me when you're ready." *I say, offering a comforting smile.* "I'll hear you out."

Kurisu: "...Okay." *She nods, her grip on the plushie loosening a bit.*
