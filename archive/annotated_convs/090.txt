Okabe: "Want to get something to eat on the way back? My treat." *I suggest, a grin spreading across my face.*

Mayuri: "Really? You never treat me." *She tilts her head, her eyes wide with surprise.*

Okabe: "Heh heh heh, I'm in a good mood today!" *I chuckle, leaning back in my chair.*

Mayuri: "Then how about Kitchen Jiro? Their minced cutlet is, um, god tier." *She suggests, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.*

Okabe: "Just leave it to me." *I give her a thumbs up, already looking forward to the meal.*

Mayuri: "Yay! I love you, Okarin♪ Mayushii's really happy!" *She claps her hands together, her face lit up with joy.*

Okabe: "Thanks for coming in on a Saturday. Your devotion to science makes me proud." *I announce as I enter the lab, my eyes shining with appreciation.*

Kurisu: "Yeah..." *She sighs deeply, brushing a strand of hair out of her face.* "It's the middle of summer, but instead of going on vacation, I'm stuck in this sauna with a bunch of pervs. Where did I go wrong?"

Okabe: "Wipe your tears, you experiment-loving girl without a single friend." *I wave her off, a smirk playing on my lips.*

Kurisu: "I'm not crying! Besides, you're the one who told us to be here." *She retorts, crossing her arms over her chest.*

Okabe: "Indeed. But the one who obeyed my orders and arrived on time... was you." *I point at her, a knowing look in my eyes.*

Mayuri: "You know, Chris-chan is actually a very honest and hardworking girl. That's what Mayushii thinks♪" *She says, her mouth full of nuggets.*

Kurisu: "Eh, wha...!? How can this girl say something like that while eating a nugget..." *She blushes, her eyes darting away in embarrassment.*

Itaru: "A yuri flag. I get it." *He chuckles, adjusting his glasses with a smirk.*

Kurisu: "Please unget it." *She glares at him, her cheeks still flushed.*

Mayuri: "Here, Chris-chan. Have a nugget." *She offers, holding out a nugget to Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "Th-thanks..." *She mumbles, accepting the nugget with a small smile.*

Okabe: "Don't put that there. It's filthy." *I protest, trying to find a place for my laundry.*

Kurisu: "Like I care. What kind of guy puts his underwear in a girl's face? Have some decency." *She scolds, pushing the laundry away with a disgusted look.*

Okabe: "If you're that interested in my underwear, then just say so." *I tease, my eyes sparkling with mischief.*

Kurisu: "Wh-wha...! I'm not interested at all!" *She stammers, her face turning a deeper shade of red.*

Mayuri: "Come on, guys. No more talking about underwear. Mayushii's trying to eat here, okay?" *She chimes in, still munching on her nuggets.*

Itaru: "How can you say that when you're still shoveling nuggets into your mouth..." *He mutters, shaking his head in amusement.*

Okabe: "Don't interrupt me!" *I snap, finally giving up and placing my laundry in the changing room.* "As I explained to Daru yesterday, I've noticed something about the results of our experiments! D-Mails have too many uncertain variables. We can never be sure what will happen when we send one."

Kurisu: "It's not like we can do anything about that. After all, the result is up to whoever receives the mail. Of course, if you can analyze the recipient's psychology, then you might be able to manipulate them into doing what you want. Though that might be a bit too much for Hououin Underwear here." *She retorts, her eyes gleaming with a mixture of annoyance and amusement.*

Itaru: "You just wanted to say underwear, didn't you?" *He laughs, nudging her playfully.*

Okabe: "Underwear aside, the fact is that D-Mail is still far from complete." *I declare, my voice carrying a serious undertone.* "And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I called you here today. The purpose of today's Round Table Conference is--"

Itaru: "Another Round Table?" *He interrupts, raising an eyebrow in amusement.*

Kurisu: "If you want a Round Table Conference that much, at least go buy a round table." *She suggests, a smirk playing on her lips.*

Mayuri: "Remember what Okarin said, Chris-chan? The round table is in our hearts." *She reminds, her face beaming with innocence.*

Kurisu: "Mayuri-san, you're really innocent. But you shouldn't take everything Okabe says seriously." *She advises, her voice softening as she looks at Mayuri.*
