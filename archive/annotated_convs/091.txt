Okabe: *I feel a glare burning into my skin, turning to see Kurisu glaring at me even harder than before.* "Isn't it too early to give up? Haven't we already succeeded with D-Mail, a first in human history?"

Itaru: *He chuckles, shaking his head.* "But we're not the first. Didn't SERN do it before us?"

Okabe: "Humanity's first time-traveling email. For we who have achieved that miracle, nothing is impossible!" *I declare, not letting their doubts shake my conviction.*

Kurisu: "Such baseless confidence." *She sighs, crossing her arms over her chest.* "Anyway, wasn't it just a coincidence that we discovered D-Mail? We still haven't figured out what's functioning as the lifter."

Okabe: "We just need to figure that out, don't we?" *I ask, raising an eyebrow at her.*

Kurisu: "It's futile." *She shakes her head, looking defeated.* "How do you solve a problem that even SERN can't figure out? If you can't set the destination, then you don't know where you'll leap to."

Itaru: *He shudders, wrapping his arms around himself.* "I'll pass on leaping into deep space, thanks."

Okabe: "Wait a second. We don't set the destination when we send a D-Mail, yet it still arrives where it's supposed to. How do you explain that?" *I challenge, holding up my phone for emphasis.*

Kurisu: "Now that you mention it..." *She frowns, deep in thought.*

Itaru: "You set the mail address, right? Isn't that enough?" *He suggests, shrugging his shoulders.*

Kurisu: "Is it? I don't think a phone signal can be received from millions of kilometers away." *She counters, raising an eyebrow at him.*

Mayuri: "I bet you'd get a busy signal or something!" *She giggles, her laughter lightening the serious atmosphere.*

Okabe: "Maybe our cellphones are acting like black holes and white holes." *I suggest, staring at my phone.*

Kurisu: "You shouldn't speculate like that. You have zero basis." *She warns, looking stern.*

Okabe: "Is it possible that we form a wormhole?" *I ask, ignoring her disapproval.*

Kurisu: "No wormholes have ever been confirmed to exist." *She flatly denies, her arms folded.*

Okabe: "In any case, the cold, hard truth is that D-Mails arrive precisely when and where we want them to. We're ahead of SERN in that regard. Now, can we apply D-Mail technology to physical time travel?" *I question, looking around the room.*

Itaru: "But with D-Mails, you can only send 36 bytes of data. No way you can send a whole person with that kind of limit." *He points out, his face serious.*

Kurisu: "If you want to become GelOkarin, I'm not stopping you." *She says, shrugging her shoulders.*

Okabe: "It would be best to leave physical transfer aside for now. Sending data through time is an amazing feat by itself. We should be satisfied with what we've got." *I say, looking at each member of the team.*

Kurisu: "Such pessimism is unbecoming of a scientist sworn to uncover the secrets of the universe." *She retorts, her gaze challenging.*

Okabe: "I'm telling you to know your limits. If you're going to uncover the secrets of the universe, you need personnel, equipment, and funding to rival SERN's. It's one thing to set lofty goals, but this impoverished lab has no resources to speak of. I've been thinking. Maybe we should bring the PhoneWave to a proper research institution and entrust it to a specialist. SERN's keeping their time machine research top secret, so if we make an official announcement, it'll benefit the future of mankind." *I state, looking at each of my friends in turn, hoping they understand the gravity of our situation.*
