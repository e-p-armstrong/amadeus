Itaru: "We can't, remember?" *Daru frowns, looking puzzled.*

Okabe: "You said all we needed was an IBN 5100 of our own!" *I insist, frustration creeping into my voice.*

Itaru: "Right. That's the problem. We can't do anything without one." *He responds with a sigh.*

Okabe: "Huh?" *My brow furrows as I struggle to understand his words.* "But I got you an IBN 5100. You haven't started working on it yet?"

Itaru: "Huh? You got one? When?" *Daru looks at me, clearly surprised.*

Kurisu: "First I've heard of it." *She shrugs, meeting my confused look with a raised eyebrow.*

Okabe: "Impossible!" *In disbelief, I quickly dash into the development room, my eyes frantically scanning the room for the missing item.* 

Okabe: "...It's gone." *My voice barely a whisper, I stare at the empty spot where the IBN 5100 should have been.*

Okabe: "The IBN 5100 was right here! Where did it go!?" *I exclaim, turning back to face the group, my heart pounding.*

Mayuri: "I don't remember." *Mayuri shakes her head, her voice filled with uncertainty.*

Itaru: "Donated to Yanabayashi Shrine? That's stupid." *Daru scoffs, dismissively waving a hand.*

Kurisu: "You sure you weren't hallucinating? It's hot these days." *Kurisu suggests, her tone skeptical yet not entirely dismissive.*

Okabe: *Despair seeping into me, I pull out my phone, quickly typing a message to Moeka.* 

Okabe: "Don't tell me it was John Titor!?" *Suddenly, I shout, a new suspect forming in my mind.* "Of course! Titor's goal was to obtain an IBN 5100! And I've already contacted him several times. But how did he get my personal information!?" 

Kurisu: "Calm down. Tell us what happened. You don't have to be precise. Just say whatever comes to mind. We can work it out later." *Kurisu instructs, her calm voice cutting through my panic.*

Okabe: "Y-yeah..." *I nod, wiping my sweat with a handkerchief, before I start to explain the purpose of the IBN 5100 and how I came to obtain one.*

Kurisu: "Hmmm... The IBN 5100 may have disappeared as a result of changes someone made to the past." *Kurisu muses, her fingers tapping thoughtfully at her chin.*

Okabe: "Ohh! So you believe me!" *I exclaim, relief washing over me.*

Kurisu: "But from my perspective, all of the D-Mails we sent so far were trivial." *She remarks, her gaze thoughtful and distant.*
