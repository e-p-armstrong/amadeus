Kurisu: "There was one more. The first mail Okabe accidentally sent that said I was dead." *She leans forward, her eyes narrowing in concentration.*

Okabe: "But from my perspective, we sent several more." *I insist, my hands making grand gestures as if to paint the picture of the alternate reality I remember.*

Mayuri: "You mean how you sent the winning LOTO SIX numbers?" *She tilts her head, her fingers tapping thoughtfully against her chin.* "And how Luka-chan bought a ticket with those numbers, but didn't win?"

Kurisu: "But nobody aside from Okabe remembers him sending it." *She turns to the others, her gaze questioning.*

Okabe: "But I showed you guys afterwards. It was still in my phone's arrival history." *I grit my teeth, frustration boiling up within me.*

Itaru: "We were so close." *He says, his eyes dropping to the floor in disappointment.*

Mayuri: "Is that all?" *She asks, her voice small and uncertain.*

Okabe: "No. There's more." *I take a deep breath, steeling myself for the next revelation.* "Moeka and Lukako each sent a D-Mail."

Kurisu: "Oh, right. That's what you claim," *She interrupts, her tone taking on a hint of skepticism.* "but Hashida, Mayuri-san, and I don't remember either of those."

Mayuri: "Owww... Mayushii's getting a headache..." *She whines, rubbing her temples in distress.*

Okabe: "I already told you guys. I'm the only one who keeps his memories after the world changes." *I reiterate, my voice taking on a note of finality.*

Kurisu: "So according to your perspective, when did the IBN 5100 disappear? Did it just happen? When's the last time you remember seeing it in the lab?" *She fires off the questions, her gaze steady and unwavering.*

Okabe: *I put my index finger to my forehead, my eyes flickering closed as I delve into my memories.* "Well... I'm sure... it was August 3rd. I remember it being in the lab on August 3rd."

Kurisu: "Are you certain?" *She presses, her eyes never leaving my face.*
