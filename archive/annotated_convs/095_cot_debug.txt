Okabe: "...Damn. Okay. Sorry for calling you so suddenly." *I rub the back of my neck, my gaze distant as I try to make sense of the situation.*

Luka: "N-no problem. I'm sorry that I couldn't help.." *Luka stammers, fiddling with his phone nervously.*

Okabe: "Mayuri, I need to contact Faris." *I turn to Mayuri, my tone urgent.*

Mayuri: "Hweh?" *She looks up from her eclair, blinking in surprise.*

Okabe: "You people don't have a care in the world, do you!?" *I spread my arms wide, gesturing towards the group.* "There's some crazy stuff happening here!"

Kurisu: "Or it could all just be in your head. No need to panic." *She replies calmly, taking a bite of her own eclair.*

Mayuri: "You need Feris-chan for something? I wonder if she's working today." *She tilts her head, her brow furrowing in thought.*

Itaru: "Faris-tan's off today." *He pipes up, not looking up from his laptop.*

Okabe: "You know her phone number, right? See if you can get ahold of her." *I point at Mayuri, my tone demanding.*

Mayuri: "Okay!" *She pulls out her phone, tapping away happily.* "Feris-chan? Good afternyan-nyan♪ It's Mayushii, nyan♪" *She greets cheerfully after the call connects.*

Kurisu: "Nya, nyan...?" *She raises an eyebrow, clearly bemused by Mayuri's enthusiastic greeting.*
