Kurisu: "Okabe!" *She strides up to me, her eyes blazing.*

Okabe: *I blink in surprise, taken aback by her sudden aggression.* "Huh?"

Kurisu: "If you want to give me stupid nicknames, that's fine -- I mean, it's not, but..." *Her voice is biting, and she crosses her arms in front of her.* "What you said just now is below the belt. I didn't take you for the kind of guy who thinks it's funny to hurt people's feelings, but I guess I was wrong. You're a real jerk, Okabe."

Okabe: *I stare at her, struggling to understand her anger.* "Apologize. Apologize to Urushibara-san right now."

Luka: "It's okay." *He rises from the sofa, his voice barely a whisper.*

Okabe: "No no no! That's not how I see you, Lukako. You're a guy, remember!? Or are you denying reality too!?" *I raise my hands in an explanatory gesture, desperate to clear the misunderstanding.*

Kurisu: "You're the one denying reality!" *She points an accusing finger at me.*

Mayuri: "That's right! Luka-chan's a girl, Okarin. You're terrible." *She chimes in, her voice gentle yet firm.*

Okabe: "Mayuri, when did you start calling Lukako 'Luka-chan' instead of 'Luka-kun'?" *I turn to her, my confusion growing.*

Kurisu: "Cut it out already, Okabe! She's a girl!" *She cuts in, her voice rising in frustration.*

Luka: "I'm going home!" *She tries to slip past me, but I catch her hand.*

Okabe: "Hold it, Lukako! You can't fool me! You're as much a man as I am! And I know how to prove it!" *I pin her arms and reach for her lower body.*

Luka: "Ugh, no, don't... Okabe-san, please... stop... sniff." *Her voice is shaky, her body trembling in my grasp.*

Okabe: "Oh...?" *I freeze, my hand finding nothing where I expected to. I pull back, my mind racing.* "Lukako, you... you're a girl!?"

Kurisu: "That's what we've been saying!" *Her voice is laced with exasperation.*

Okabe: *Before I can respond, I feel a sharp pain on the top of my head.* 

Luka: "hic... ugg... egh..." *She breaks down in tears, while Mayuri comforts her.*

Okabe: *I press a moist towel to my throbbing head, my mind spinning.*

Kurisu: "I want to vivisect your skull and remove your brain for a good washing. Then I'll submerge it in culture fluid so you can never do anything like that again! Anyway, just be thankful I haven't reported you to the police." *She glares at me, her anger palpable.*
