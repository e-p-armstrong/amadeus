Okabe: "So I can use your grief to power my time machine. Heh heh heh!" *I chuckle with an air of mad mischief.*

Suzuha: "Ahaha! You really are a mad scientist. So eeeevil! If I meet my father, I'll stop by. Then we can do a gun salute!" *She laughs heartily before hopping onto her bike.*

Okabe: "Hey, wait! Let me on! Hey!" *I call out, reaching out for her, but she's already pedaling away. With a sigh, I turn and head back towards the lab.*

Okabe: "I shall now brief you on Operation Eldhrimnir." *I announce, gathering my lab members - Mayuri, Kurisu, and Luka - around me.*

Okabe: "I want you guys to get ready for a party." *I explain the plan, informing them of what Suzuha had told me.*

Kurisu: "And what are you going to do?" *She asks, crossing her arms and giving me a skeptical look.*

Okabe: "Me? I'm going to follow that Part-Time Warrior and report back as the situation changes." *I propose confidently.*

Kurisu: "Don't you dare. Let her be alone with her father." *She retorts, her eyes flashing with annoyance.*

Okabe: "Heh heh heh. You shouldn't be so quick to reject my plans, Christina." *I chuckle, leaning back in my chair.* "You don't understand the intricacies of the human psyche. Now that you've rejected my plan, there's no way I'm not going through with it! You have underestimated my pride!"

Kurisu: "Get over yourself." *She shoots back, rolling her eyes at my theatrics.*

Okabe: "Besides, Christina, you and she are enemies, are you not? You protect her from me while plotting her demise? That makes you a hypocrite!" *I accuse, pointing a finger at her.*

Kurisu: "You just don't have standards, that's all." *She counters, not backing down.*

Mayuri: "She's right. I don't think you should bother her, Okarin." *Mayuri chimes in, continuing to work on her costume.* "No matter what happens, we need to give her a waaaarm welcome. I'll do anything to help make this party super special."

Luka: "Um, actually, I haven't met this Suzuha-san..." *Luka admits shyly.*

Mayuri: "Suzu-san's really nice. I'm sure you'll get along with her too!" *Mayuri reassures him with a warm smile.*

Kurisu: "Nice?" *She mutters under her breath, looking thoughtful.*

Okabe: "Anyway, I'm going to tail her now. You guys--" *I'm cut off by Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "No! Get it through your thick skull!" *She stands firm, her arms crossed and her expression stern.*

Okabe: "Dammit, assistant! How dare you give me orders!?" *I retort, slamming my hand on the table.*

Kurisu: "Don't even think about running off somewhere." *She warns, looking at me with a determined expression.* "Anyway... I hope Amane-san finds her father." *Her voice softens, and she scratches her cheek in a rare show of bashfulness.*

Okabe: "Yeah." *I agree, my tone matching hers.* 

Kurisu: "That would be... nice." *She murmurs, lost in thought.*

Kurisu: "Hey, Okabe..." *She starts to fidget, looking uncomfortable.* "I'm sorry about before."

Okabe: "Before?" *I ask, raising an eyebrow in confusion.*

Kurisu: "When I hit you with my book." *She admits, looking down.* "I thought you were just being a pervert. But when I thought about it later, I realized that you were being completely serious. But I acted on impulse, without even considering what you had to say."

Okabe: "Forget it." *I dismiss, waving her apology aside.* "Regardless of my intentions, the fact of the matter is that I made Lukako cry."

Kurisu: "Just to make sure, you're not a perverted scumbag, are you?" *She looks up at me, her eyes searching my face for the truth.*

Okabe: "Make sure, my ass! Are you trying to apologize or what!?" *I retort, feeling my face heat up.*

Kurisu: "I just don't want to you to use science as an excuse to be a pervert. Not while I'm helping, at least." *She warns, looking at me with a serious expression.*
