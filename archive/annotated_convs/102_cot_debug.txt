Okabe: "I am Lab Mem 001, the founder of the lab. If my friends are in danger, I'll rush to their aid. And I would tear my own limbs off before I knowingly brought harm to any of you." *I say, pounding my chest for emphasis.*

Kurisu: "Pff..." *She tries to stifle a laugh, her eyes sparkling with amusement.*

Okabe: "What's so funny?" *I tilt my head questioningly.*

Kurisu: "That has to be the cheesiest thing you've ever said." *She responds, a teasing grin on her face.*

Okabe: "Hmph..." *I cross my arms, pretending to be offended.*

Kurisu: "Still, it's nice to hear. The research institute I work at in America is full of talented people from all over the world... but it's not a friendly place. Everyone thinks he or she is the best. You think you have an ego? Over there, scientists hurl insults at each other on a daily basis. Sometimes they even sabotage each other's work. When my thesis was chosen to represent the lab, many of the older men complained. And when I came back here as a kind of reverse exchange student, my classmates were all too afraid to talk to me. Compared to that, your lab is childish... but comfortable." *She says, her gaze far-off, as if lost in memories.*

Kurisu: "You're really concerned about Amane-san, aren't you? That part of you, I can respect. B-but I'm not praising you, okay?" *She stutters, her cheeks suddenly reddening.*

Okabe: "Maybe I..." *I start, hesitating for a moment.*

Kurisu: "Eh?" *She looks at me with surprise.*

Okabe: "Maybe all I ever wanted was friends." *I admit, looking down at my hands.*

Kurisu: "Okabe..." *She says softly, her expression softening.*

Okabe: "There aren't many people I can trust... After all, I am an insane mad scientist wanted the world over. My enemies are everywhere waiting to strike! Curse this incredible genius brain of mine! Muhahaha!" *I laugh maniacally, attempting to hide my vulnerability behind my mad scientist persona.*

Kurisu: "I, um... think of you as a friend too." *She admits, looking away and fidgeting with her fingers.*

Okabe: "...What?" *I ask, taken aback.*

Kurisu: "You said I was your friend, remember? You said I was important to you. That made me really... happy, I guess." *She says, her voice barely a whisper.*

Okabe: "Do you have a fever?" *I ask, raising an eyebrow in confusion.*

Kurisu: "No! What the hell!? Here I am trying to find something decent about you, and you... I don't care anymore, stupid! You're really... stupid." *She says, her face red with frustration and embarrassment.*

Kurisu: *Without another word, she quickly strides ahead, leaving me in her wake.*

Okabe: *I give chase, my mind racing. I can't help but wonder if she's plotting something. Shaking off my suspicions, I refocus on the task at hand: planning the party for Suzuha.*

Kurisu: "Huh? Over there, isn't that..." *She points in the distance, her attention caught by something off-screen.*
