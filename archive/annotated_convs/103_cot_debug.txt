Okabe: "Naturally. Faris is a lab mem too. Heh heh heh." *I chuckle, attempting to lighten the mood.*

Itaru: "Dammit! Why do they have to be on the same day!? Can't it wait until tomorrow?" *He exclaims, throwing his hands up in frustration.*

Okabe: "What will it be? The time to choose is now." *I raise an eyebrow at Itaru, challenging him to make a decision.*

Itaru: "I want to eat Faris-tan's home cooking..." *He mutters, a look of longing on his face.*

Okabe: "If you give up the offline meet, then that settles it." *I nod, accepting his decision.*

Itaru: "I give up. I give up the offline meeeet!" *He sighs in resignation, and we all head back to the lab. On our arrival, Mayuri and Luka are already busy with preparations.*

Mayuri: "Huh? Daru-kun's here too?" *She looks surprised, glancing over her shoulder.*

Itaru: "What about Faris-tan? Where is she?" *He asks, scanning the room.*

Kurisu: "You've been tricked." *She states matter-of-factly, crossing her arms.*

Mayuri: "Feris-chan said she couldn't come." *She explains, wincing slightly at Itaru's disappointed expression.*

Itaru: "Wait, seriously!? Okarin! What's going on here!? This isn't funny, man!" *He turns to me, an accusing finger pointed in my direction.*

Okabe: "Don't worry. I'll make sure she comes to the next one." *I reassure him, trying to defuse the situation.*

Itaru: "You've gotta be kidding me! I was looking forward to that time machine meet..." *He grumbles, sinking into a chair.*

Kurisu: "Time machine meet? What's that?" *She asks, curiosity piqued.*

Itaru: "It's an offline meet for this sci-fi BBS I post on. Some famous writers are going to be there. I won't forgive you, Okarin. Ever." *He glares at me, his frustration clear.*

Okabe: "What? Why didn't you say so? I would've gone too!" *I exclaim, surprised by his revelation.* "...Does anyone else smell that?" *I ask, suddenly detecting a strange aroma.*

Kurisu: "Smell what?" *She sniffs the air, a puzzled look on her face.*

Okabe: "Did we blow a fuse somewhere?" *I wonder aloud, looking around for the source of the smell.*

Luka: "S-sorry..." *She stammers, looking down at her hands.* "That's probably the smell of... Mayuri's cooking..."

Okabe: "...What? This is the smell of food!?" *I exclaim, surprised by the revelation.*

Kurisu: "I'll help too." *She offers, rolling up her sleeves.* "Hm. Should I use the PhoneWave?"

Luka: "N-no! If you put raw eggs in a microwave, they'll explode!" *She warns, looking alarmed.*

Kurisu: "We took the door off. It should be fine, right?" *She asks, looking to me for confirmation.*
