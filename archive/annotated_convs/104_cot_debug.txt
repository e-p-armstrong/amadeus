Itaru: "Yeah. Keep us in the loop, man." *He chimes in, looking equally concerned.*

Okabe: "Suzuha ran away from me. I guess she couldn't find her father." *I admit, rubbing the back of my neck awkwardly.*

Mayuri: "Oh..." *Her eyes well up with tears, her hand flying to her mouth in shock.*

Okabe: *I laugh suddenly, the sound echoing around the room.* "Heh... heh heh heh... MUHAHAHAHA!"

Luka: *He flinches at my sudden laughter.* "O-Okabe-san? What's wrong? Are you okay?"

Kurisu: *She crosses her arms, studying me with a skeptical eye.* "His brain is probably oxygen-starved from too much running."

Itaru: *He shakes his head, chuckling to himself.* "Okarin... chill."

Okabe: "Heh, look at you all! Why the long faces, friends!?" *I wave my arm dramatically, a wide grin on my face.* "Have you forgotten? We have just the thing for moments like these!" *I point triumphantly to the curtain covering the development room.*

Kurisu: *She follows my gesture, her eyes widening in realization.* "You're going to send a D-Mail?"
