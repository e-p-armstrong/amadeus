Mayuri: *She pauses her DVD and comes up beside me, listening in on the conversation.*

Itaru: "With a connection this fast, we can control the LHC practically in real-time. I haven't actually tried it yet, though." *He shrugs, looking somewhat pleased with himself.*

Mayuri: "The LHC is that 20-kilometer-long tunnel thing, right? Um, what does it do again?" *She looks at me with wide, curious eyes.*

Okabe: "It accelerates protons and smashes them together." *I explain, gesturing as if illustrating the process in the air.*

Mayuri: "Oh yeah. Mini black holes, right?" *She nods, seeming to understand.*

Itaru: "The official line is that mini black holes might manifest as a byproduct of the particle collision, but that's not the truth." *He interjects, shaking his head.*

Okabe: "According to the top secret documents we found, the LHC was intended to create black holes from the very beginning." *I lean back in my chair, my tone serious.*

Kurisu: "Okabe." *Suddenly, she emerges from the development room, her expression unusually grave.*

Okabe: "What's wrong?" *I question, taken aback by her stern demeanor.*

Kurisu: "I figured it out." *She states, crossing her arms over her chest.*

Okabe: "Really!?" *I lean forward, excitement creeping into my voice.*

Kurisu: "Keep in mind that this is just a hypothesis based on what we've observed. It's closely related to what you guys were just talking about -- the LHC." *She begins, her voice steady.*

Okabe: "I believe it was you, Christina, who called the LHC the world's largest microwave." *I interject, recalling her previous comment.*

Kurisu: "Yes. Exactly. My hunch was right. You've created a monster, Okabe." *She glares at me, her words hanging heavily in the air.*

Okabe: "Give me details." *I demand, my voice steady despite the unsettling accusation.*

Kurisu: "Did you know that the microwave oven was invented as a byproduct of radar research?" *She begins to explain, her tone analytical.*

Okabe: "According to Daru's blueprints, the microwave and the phone are made to send out shared electromagnetic waves by taking their leads... And hardwiring each of them to the magnetron's cathode and anode." *I take over the explanation, eager to understand her findings.*

Kurisu: "Both devices use electromagnetic waves. I'm not a specialist, though, so I can't examine the extent or magnitude of the influence that fusion has... But hypothetically, if the cellphone were to become a stepping stone, scattering the military-grade electromagnetic waves over a vast range of hundreds of kilometers-- Then not just Akihabara, but all of Tokyo would turn into the inside of a microwave oven. Taking into account slight variance due to body weight, the average time until death for the people inside would be-- Three minutes." *She finishes, her expression grim.*

Mayuri: "Ehh!?" *She gasps, her eyes wide with shock.*

Itaru: "Seriously? Then the PhoneWave's a weapon of mass destruction, isn't it!?" *He exclaims, leaning back in his chair as if recoiling from the revelation.*

Kurisu: "Let me tell you what happens inside the PhoneWave. The air inside the oven is full of invisible hydrogen atoms. First, it bombards the atoms with microwaves to increase their energy potential. This is the normal function of a microwave oven. But when you add the electromagnetic waves from the phone... The harmonics trigger a chain reaction. The particles collide repeatedly at near light-speed, gaining mass and energy each time. In other words, it becomes a sort of particle accelerator." *She concludes, her tone serious.*
