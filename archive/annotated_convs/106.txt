Okabe: "So, if the LHC was created to generate mini black holes-- Then the PhoneWave (name subject to change) must also produce mini black holes!" *I exclaim with a triumphant flourish of my hand.*

Kurisu: *She falls silent, her brows furrowed in thought and doesn't deny my claim.* "It's a miracle that thing has been so stable. But there's still one thing I don't understand. Even if it does produce mini black holes, they should evaporate instantly. But that's not what happens in the PhoneWave. The gelification phenomenon proves that. Just like in the LHC, our mini black holes are turning into Kerr black holes."

Okabe: "According to Titor, you have to inject electrons to produce the Kerr black hole effect." *I interject, recalling from my memory.*

Kurisu: "Where do the injected electrons come from? That's what I don't understand. The LHC uses something called a lifter to inject electrons into the black hole and control the gravitational field. Something is filling that role inside the PhoneWave." *She says, her fingers tapping thoughtfully against the table.*

Itaru: "S-something?" *He stammers, looking between us with wide eyes.*

Kurisu: "Like I said, I don't know what." *She shrugs, spreading her hands in a helpless gesture.*

Okabe: *I lean back in my chair, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Looks like we need to review what the LHC is."

Itaru: "LHC stands for Large Hadron Collider." *He pipes up, adjusting his glasses as he turns to face Mayuri.*

Mayuri: "Had drawn?" *She tilts her head, her eyebrows knitting together in confusion.*

Kurisu: "It's the name of an elementary particle." *She quickly explains, a soft smile tugging at her lips.*

Itaru: *He launches into a detailed explanation of the LHC, his words flowing smoothly as he moves his hands to illustrate his points.* "The LHC is basically a huge circular tunnel underneath Switzerland and France. It sits about 100 meters below ground, and has a total length of 27 kilometers... We know they're a bunch of stinking liars."

Okabe: *I rise from my chair, gesturing grandly to the room.* "And that, my fellow lab members, brings us to the question. Can the PhoneWave (name subject to change) beat SERN to true physical time travel?"

Kurisu: "Two problems. One, setting the destination. Two, the lifter." *She interjects, her tone serious.*

Okabe: "We've already established that the D-Mail arrives precisely when and where it's supposed to." *I argue, my voice firm.*

Kurisu: "...It's dangerous to accept that without verification." *She warns, shooting me a stern glance.*

Okabe: "As for the lifter, we already know it exists. We just need to figure out what it is." *I declare, tapping my finger against the tabletop.*

Kurisu: "I don't think we're going to find it. The PhoneWave's not exactly big, you know, and we've been poking at it for days without turning up a clue. Even if we do find it, it'll take forever to learn how to tune the electron feed properly." *She sighs, running a hand through her hair.*

Itaru: "How long is forever?" *He asks, his eyes wide with curiosity.*

Kurisu: "SERN's been working on it for nine years and they still haven't solved it." *She responds, a hint of frustration creeping into her voice.*
