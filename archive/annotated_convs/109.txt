Okabe: "Heh... heh heh heh... MUHAHAHA!" *I suddenly burst out laughing, my eyes gleaming with excitement.* "It's me. Everything is falling into place. The plan can now proceed to the final stage. I'm talking about Operation Verthandi, obviously. Heh. Christina had me fooled. I never knew she was capable of this. It must have been the choice of Steins Gate that sent her here. Don't worry. I have everything under control. Nothing can stop us now. El Psy Kongroo." *I finish my imaginary call and put the phone back in my pocket, turning to face Kurisu.*

Okabe: "Were you listening? Good. Commence preparations for Operation Verthandi!" *I command, pointing a finger at her.*

Kurisu: "First, explain what that is!" *She retorts, clearly unimpressed by my theatrics.* 

Okabe: "We're going to build your time leap machine, Christina. And you'd better not say it can't be done! Not after showing me the way!" *I challenge her, confident in her abilities.*

Kurisu: "Well, this is Akihabara. I should be able to find the parts I need." *She responds thoughtfully, a determined look in her eyes.*

Okabe: "Then it's decided. I'm placing you in charge of this operation. Whatever you need, ask, and it shall be yours. Together, we shall complete the first time leap machine in human history!" *I declare, striking a dramatic pose.*

Kurisu: *She nods in response, her eyes shining with determination.* 

Okabe: "What are you doing?" *I ask, noticing her preoccupied look.*

Kurisu: "Thinking about the time leap machine. I know we can make it, but I'm wondering what will happen if we actually use it." *She confesses, her fingers still twirling the pen.*

Okabe: "You're thinking too hard. Finish the machine, then worry about it." *I advise, trying to ease her worries.*

Kurisu: "You're so pompous." *She groans, flopping down on the desk in frustration.*

Okabe: "Hey, Okabe... Can I talk to you about something completely unrelated?" *She breaks the silence, her voice soft and hesitant.*

Okabe: "I'd rather talk about something related." *I respond, not expecting the change in topic.*

Kurisu: "You told me before that I could ask you anything. Remember?" *She reminds me, a hint of hope in her voice.*

Okabe: "I think... my father hates me." *She admits, her voice barely a whisper. As her leader, it's up to me to help her through this.*

Okabe: "Very well. Speak!" *I command, determined to help her.*

Kurisu: "Heh... you really are pompous." *She chuckles weakly, a small smile on her face.*

Okabe: "I assume it was your father on the phone the other day?" *I ask, recalling the time I found her outside the lab, crying into her phone.*

Kurisu: "...Yeah. I don't remember the last time he had a kind word for me. Even when we were living together, before I went to America, he acted like I wasn't there. We're supposed to be family, aren't we?" *She asks, her voice filled with sadness and longing.*
