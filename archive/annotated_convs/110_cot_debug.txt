Kurisu: "My father's a physicist. Even as a child, I loved to hear him talk about science. I couldn't understand a word of it, but I always begged him to explain." *She smiles, but there's a hint of self-mockery in her expression.* "I wanted to understand his work, so I started studying physics. I must have been five."

Okabe: *I listen, my eyes widening in surprise.* "Damn. I guess that's what makes you a genius. Or perhaps the yearning for your father's love was what gave birth to your genius."

Kurisu: "Thanks to that, I always got perfect grades in math. I ignored all the other subjects, though, so my grades were a little skewed. I even read my father's papers. I was a little girl trying to comprehend theoretical physics, but I gave it everything I had. I needed to understand. By sixth grade, I had learned enough that I could discuss my father's theories with him. I was so happy that I could talk to my father on his level, you know? We used to argue all night long. And then I started winning those arguments. All of them."

Okabe: "Yeah. I can definitely see how that would make him hate you." *I lean back, crossing my arms as I consider the tragedy fitting for a girl genius.*

Kurisu: "You really think that's why?" *She looks at me, her gaze questioning.*

Okabe: "I'm absolutely certain that's why." *I affirm, nodding slightly.*

Kurisu: "I guess he did have a lot of pride. Anyway, one day, he suddenly stopped talking to me altogether. Then he started fighting with my mom, and finally he stopped coming home. I really loved my dad, so it was a big shock. I felt it was my fault things turned out that way. I couldn't go to school, I was so depressed. And then Mom recommended I study abroad." *Her voice grows softer as she speaks, a hint of sadness creeping into her words.*

Okabe: "So that's why you went to America. You were just too talented for your own good. So, how do you feel about your father now?" *I ask, watching her closely.*

Kurisu: "I don't know..." *She looks down, her fingers twisting anxiously in her lap.*

Okabe: "He's in Japan, right? Have you seen him at all?" *I press, trying to understand more of her situation.*

Kurisu: "No... he doesn't want to see me. That's what we were talking about on the phone. I asked if we could meet, but he told me to stay away from him." *Her voice is barely above a whisper now, and I can't help but feel a pang of sympathy for her.*

Okabe: "Are you crying?" *I ask, noticing the shimmer in her eyes.*

Kurisu: "J-just a little, okay?" *She quickly wipes her eyes, sniffling slightly.*

Okabe: "You want to reconcile with your father. Correct?" *I ask, my tone softening.*

Kurisu: "I don't know..." *She admits, looking lost and vulnerable.*

Okabe: "If you didn't, then you wouldn't have confided in me. And you wouldn't be crying, would you?" *I offer, trying to provide some comfort.*

Kurisu: "True..." *She acknowledges, a small, sad smile on her lips.*

Okabe: "Just be straight with him. Say 'I love you, Dad. Let's make up.'" *I suggest, hoping to help her find a way to bridge the gap between them.*

Kurisu: "I think that's a little out of character for me." *She chuckles weakly, shaking her head.*

Okabe: "It's your father. Stop acting like a weak little girl." *I tell her firmly, hoping to give her the push she needs.*

Kurisu: "I'm not acting like a little girl!" *She jerks upright, her face bright red with indignation.*

Okabe: "Yes, you are. You'll never reconcile with him like that. You need to speak from the heart, give it to him straight. It's the only way to get your message across. You can't sugarcoat it. If that doesn't work, nothing will. Then you'll just have to hope that time heals the rift between you. How long has it been since you went to America?" *I press, hoping to give her a sense of perspective.*

Kurisu: "Umm... seven years." *She admits, her voice small.*

Okabe: "If nothing has changed in seven years, then maybe it will take twice that much time." *I say, not wanting to give her false hope.*

Kurisu: "I... guess you're right." *She nods, looking thoughtful.*
