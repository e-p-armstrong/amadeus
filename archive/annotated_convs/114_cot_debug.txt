Okabe: *I look around the lab, my eyes lingering on Mayuri.* "It must be my overwhelming charisma... No, wait, that makes me sound like a good person, so that can't be it... Of course! Mayuri's parents are so afraid of my insanity that they sent me their only daughter as a hostage!" 

Kurisu: *She peeks out from the development room.* "Reported. What would you do if I called the cops on you?"

Okabe: *I point at her dramatically.* "I unleash my right arm on traitors, Christina."

Kurisu: *She rolls her eyes and returns to her work.* "Yeah, yeah, chuunibyou, whatever."

Mayuri: *She bounces on her heels, a cheerful smile on her face.* "Um, I told Mom and Dad that Chris-chan would be here. Then they said okay."

Kurisu: *She freezes, turning to look at Mayuri.* "Wait, so I have to stay too?"

Mayuri: *She nods enthusiastically.* "Yup♪ Don't you have to work on the PhoneWave?"

Kurisu: *She frowns slightly, glancing at the device.* "I guess... but I don't relish the thought of spending the night here. At least, not with a certain somebody around."

Okabe: *I laugh, spreading my arms wide.* "Environment matters, Christina. This is a place of science and research, so you should have no trouble concentrating on your work. Trust the great Hououin Kyouma. Also, it may surprise you to learn that I have equipped this lab with a system that stimulates brain function. So if you were wondering where my incredible genius comes from, now you know! It's because I sleep in this room every night!"

Kurisu: *She raises an eyebrow at me.* "This stimulation system of yours... I assume it's been dumping toxic waste in your brain?"

Okabe: *I smirk, crossing my arms.* "You sound like an environmentalist, Zombie."

Mayuri: *She claps her hands together, pointing at something.* "Ah, Mayushii knows! You're talking about that, right?"

Kurisu: *She follows Mayuri's gaze, a confused look on her face.* "This... air freshener?"

Okabe: *I nod, a proud smile on my face.* "...About six months ago. It was on sale for 500 yen."

Kurisu: *She shakes her head, a small smile on her face.* "I'm starting to think even you don't believe the stuff you say. And besides, this air freshener is empty."

Okabe: *I shrug, not really bothered.* "Yeah. When I went to buy replacement packs, they had already stopped selling them."

Kurisu: *She sighs, rubbing her temples.* "Well, whatever. I was planning to stay either way. I'll join you, Mayuri-san."

Mayuri: *She beams at Kurisu.* "Really? That's great!"

Kurisu: *She points a finger at me.* "On one condition. Okabe leaves."

Okabe: *I gasp, clutching my chest in mock hurt.* "Me, leave? I practically live here! This lab was promised to me by Steins Gate. It's the dwelling place of my soul!"

Kurisu: *She crosses her arms, not backing down.* "We girls are staying here overnight, so you filthy boys need to show respect. Your home isn't even far from here, right?"

Mayuri: *She tilts her head, thinking.* "Okarin lives close to Mayushii, in Ikebukuro."

Kurisu: *She smiles triumphantly.* "Why, that's less than 30 minutes by train. Anyway, I'm not going to need your help tonight, so just go home like a good boy, okay?"

Okabe: *I cross my arms defiantly.* "But I refuse."

Kurisu: *She gasps, taking a step back.* "What? Are you planning to molest us!?"

Okabe: *I point at her accusingly.* "Shut up, Mongolian Spot!"

Kurisu: *She blushes, stuttering.* "I don't have a Mongolian Spot! And when did you see my butt, anyway!?"

Okabe: *I step forward, my face serious.* "I can't leave two young girls here alone! Minors need guardians!"

Mayuri: *She giggles, covering her mouth.* "But Okarin's a minor too!"

Okabe: *I straighten, puffing out my chest.* "I'll be 20 in less than a year and a half. In other words, Steins Gate has decided that I am an adult."

Kurisu: *She shakes her head, a small smile on her face.* "I'm pretty sure that makes you a minor just like us."

Mayuri: *She looks at Kurisu earnestly.* "Um, Chris-chan? I don't think Okarin would do anything bad. I mean, we've been together for more than ten years, and he hasn't molested me once."

Kurisu: *She gives Mayuri a soft smile, patting her head.* "But he took you hostage, didn't he?"

Mayuri: *She nods cheerfully.* "Yup♪ Actually, I'm still his hostage."

Kurisu: *She frowns, looking at me.* "We should kick him out of the room."
