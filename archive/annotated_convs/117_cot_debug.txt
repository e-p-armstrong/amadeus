Itaru: "It's up to you, Okarin." *He shrugs, trying to hide his nervous anticipation.*

Kurisu: "Take care of it." *She says, glancing at me with a determined look.*

Okabe: "Your sacrifice will allow us to complete the time leap machine." *I mimic her tone sarcastically, throwing her words back at her.*

Kurisu: *She rolls her eyes but doesn't refute my statement.*

Itaru: "Besides, you're always the one who talks to the boss for us." *He grins sheepishly, avoiding my gaze.*

Okabe: "Well maybe it's time for you to put your lives on the line." *I cross my arms, challenging them.*
