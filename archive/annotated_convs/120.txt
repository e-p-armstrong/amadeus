Kurisu: "Stop it already, perv." *She scolds, without looking up from her work.*

Mayuri: "Hmm..." *She steps back, looking intently at the costume I'm holding out for her inspection.* "Okay. Thanks!"

Okabe: "It's done?" *I ask, looking at the costume with appreciation.*

Mayuri: "Yup. I finished before Chris-chan. We were racing." *She announces, looking at Kurisu with a playful glint in her eyes.*

Kurisu: "You win, Mayuri. Congratulations." *She says, not looking up from her work.*

Okabe: "Actually, I'm just about finished too." *I announce, connecting the two cords in my hands.*

Mayuri: "It's a tie..." *She says in a small voice, looking at Itaru and me with tired eyes.*

Itaru: "Man, I'm tired... I want Faris-tan to comfort me..." *He groans, collapsing onto a nearby chair.*

Kurisu: "We may have created a monster here..." *She mumbles, her gaze fixed on the completed Time Leap Machine.*

Okabe: "Why don't we decide what to call it first? I vote Heavenly Express!" 

Itaru: "PhoneWave 3rd Edition ver1. 00."

Mayuri: "Silly Hat PhoneWave-chan." *She suggests, looking at the headgear attached to the X68000 with a giggle.*

Kurisu: "You guys have too much free time." *She shakes her head, looking at us with exasperation.*

Okabe: "Does that mean you're abstaining from the vote?"

Kurisu: "...Time Leap Machine." 

Itaru: "That's terrible." *He comments, shaking his head.*

Kurisu: "C-come on! Simple is best, right? I mean, that's what Okabe's been calling it for the past two days." 

Okabe: "Looks like my assistant has zero naming sense."

Kurisu: "I don't want to hear that from a chuunibyou headcase like you." 

Itaru: "Oh-ho! So Makise-shi knows the word chuunibyou... I sense your otaku level is quite high."

Kurisu: "I... heard it from a friend. I have no idea where it comes from!" *She says quickly, avoiding my grin.*

Okabe: "It's up to you, Mayuri. Choose one." *I declare, looking at Mayuri expectantly.*

Mayuri: "Hmmm... I think Time Leap Machine is fine. Silly Hat PhoneWave-chan is super close though..." 

Itaru: "Somehow I knew she'd say that."

Kurisu: "Like I said, simple is best. Mayuri gets it." 

Mayuri: "Ehehe!" *She giggles, pleased with herself.*

Okabe: "Very well. Time Leap Machine it is. Assistant! Explain for us all how the Time Leap Machine works." *I command, gesturing towards the whiteboard.*

Kurisu: *She nods and stands in front of the whiteboard.* "In short, this device converts memories to data and sends them to the past. Let's begin with what we all know. By freak coincidence, the PhoneWave is able to produce ring singularities, much like John Titor's time machine. Through the ring singularity, we are able to send up to 36 bytes of data to the past. The signal can only be received by phones. While that does limit the range of effect, it also removes an element of uncertainty from the equation. Unlike D-Mails, memory data is sent in the form of a phone call, so we will be using a phone number, not an email address, to set the destination. The ring singularity is made naked and stable by a device known as a lifter. In our case, that's the 42-inch CRT downstairs."
