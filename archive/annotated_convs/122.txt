Kurisu: "B-boobs!?" *She blushes, stammering in surprise at the unexpected question.*

Okabe: *Ignoring her flustered reaction, I take it upon myself to answer Daru's question.* "Let's say we send your memories to you in grade school. Right now, you're some kind of omnisexual pervert who thinks inanimate objects are hot. But in elementary school, you were still an innocent child."

Itaru: "I was a boring little bastard who did nothing but study, what of it?" *He shrugs, unashamed of his past self.*

Okabe: "Basically, that little bastard would suddenly have all your perverted memories, but his personality wouldn't change. It's not like you'll become that famous anime detective with 'the looks of a child and the brains of an adult'."

Itaru: "What? That sucks." *He grumbles, clearly disappointed.*

Kurisu: *Clearing her throat, she takes over the discussion.* "Ahem. Um, since you need a phone to receive the signal, you can only send memories to the times you had one. We also need to make sure that the sender and recipient are the same person. If someone besides your past self -- your parents, or a friend, for instance -- answers the phone, then the nerve impulse signals will be projected into their brain instead. If that happens, your memories could overwrite theirs, which could obviously cause serious damage to their psyche."

Okabe: *Taking a moment to digest her explanation, I finally break the silence.* "So. What do we do with it?" *I ask, looking at each of my friends in turn.*

Kurisu: *After a few moments of silence, she finally answers.* "It's too much for us to handle, that's for sure. The safest thing would be to hand it over to the government for professional research."

Itaru: "It just doesn't feel real." *He murmurs, looking at the Time Leap Machine with a mixture of awe and fear.*

Mayuri: "Mayushii doesn't get it..." *She admits, her brows knitted together in confusion.*

Kurisu: *Turning to me, she asks,* "What about you, Okabe? And I mean you, not Hououin Kyouma."

Okabe: *Weighing the options, I finally voice my thoughts.* "I want to experiment. But there are still questions we need to answer. Who will time leap?" *I look at each of them, waiting for a response.*

Kurisu: *Meeting my gaze, she admits,* "It's hard to choose."

Itaru: "I'll pass." *He quickly states, avoiding my gaze.*

Kurisu: *Trying to reassure them, she explains,* "It's not like SERN's time machine. The possibility of becoming a jellyman is zero. This machine sends data, not the real thing. Don't let your preconceptions influence your decision. You might say it's like a cut-and-paste of your brain. Actually, it's more like a copy-paste. And it's just your memories. The original doesn't get erased."
