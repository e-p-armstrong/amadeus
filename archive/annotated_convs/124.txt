Mayuri: "Um, I have an idea..." *Her voice is frail but hopeful* "Why don't we make a banana time leap instead?"

Kurisu: "Oh Mayuri..." *She chuckles softly, shaking her head in amusement.* "Bananas don't have brains like people do."

Mayuri: "Oh... you need a brain, huh..." *She tilts her head in thought, a confused expression on her face.*

Okabe: "Let's not experiment." *I state, my voice firm and decisive.* "We'll entrust the Time Leap Machine to a suitable research institution. Then we'll announce it to the world."

Okabe: *I glance at Kurisu and Daru for their reactions, but they seem to agree with me. For the first time since we started this project, I feel a wave of relief wash over me.*

Okabe: *As we walk through the evening streets, I notice Kurisu stealing glances at me.* "Are you upset?"

Kurisu: "Upset?" *She frowns, taken aback by my question.* "About our decision not to attempt a Time Leap experiment."

Kurisu: "No, I'm not upset." *She shakes her head, her eyes softening.* "'Humans are temporal beings.' That's a Heidegger quote. I was actually relieved when you made the decision not to use the machine. If you hadn't been there, I might not have been able to stop myself. Thank you."

Okabe: *Surprised by her sudden gratitude, I reach out to feel her forehead.* "You're talking like an assistant for a change. I thought you might have a fever."

Kurisu: "Uh, what are you doing?" *She flinches, her cheeks reddening in embarrassment.*

Okabe: *I withdraw my hand, chuckling at her reaction.* "I'm not grateful to you or anything, okay!?"

Kurisu: "Anyway." *She clears her throat, trying to regain her composure.* "That 'thank you' was just a formality. Don't get me wrong, okay?"

Okabe: "Of course. I only did what I had to. I am the founder of the Future Gadget Lab, Hououin Kyouma. My first priority is to protect the welfare of my lab mems. So I have no need for your thanks."

Kurisu: "And yet you always talk about plunging the world into chaos." *She crosses her arms, raising an eyebrow at me.*

Okabe: "You are my allies, and the world is my enemy." *I declare, my voice echoing through the quiet street.*

Kurisu: "I'm speechless. You're too self-righteous." *She rolls her eyes, but her lips curl up into a small smile.*

Okabe: "You say 'speechless,' yet you're speaking?" *I reply, a smirk on my face.*

Kurisu: "Don't argue semantics." *She grumbles, but her eyes are sparkling with amusement.*

Okabe: *I glance at her, thinking about how much our relationship has grown in such a short time.* "When are you planning to return to America?"

Kurisu: "Oh yeah, I forgot to get a plane ticket. I got too caught up in improving the PhoneWave." *She admits, a sheepish smile on her face.*
