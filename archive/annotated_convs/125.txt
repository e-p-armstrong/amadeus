Kurisu: "Maybe she thinks you'll make her wear a costume again." *Kurisu quips, smirking lightly at the thought.*

Okabe: "You still haven't convinced her to cosplay?" *I ask, raising an eyebrow in curiosity.*

Mayuri: "She said it was embarrassing. I keep telling her 'Cuteness is Justice', but she never listens." *She sighs, shaking her head in disappointment.*

Kurisu: "'Cuteness is Justice'... is that what they say?" *She asks, tilting her head in bewilderment.*

Mayuri: "You're cute too, Chris-chan!" *She exclaims, pointing at Kurisu with a cheerful giggle.*

Kurisu: "Hah? Eh?" *She stammers, a blush creeping onto her face.*

Mayuri: "Hey, ComiMa's coming up. Wanna go? I can't make something new, but I have a costume of Post-Awakening Seira from Blood Tune I made last year. I think the size is just right for Chris-chan too." *She suggests, her eyes sparkling with excitement.*

Kurisu: "Me, cosplay?" *She questions, her eyebrows shooting up in surprise.*

Kurisu: "I'm sorta interested." *She admits quietly, biting her lip in thought.*

Kurisu: "But I refuse to do it in public, though." *She adds hastily, crossing her arms over her chest.*

Mayuri: "You don't have to show anyone, but eventually, you'll want them to see. The cosplay demon compels you!" *She declares, waving her hands dramatically in the air.*

Mayuri: "That reminds me. Chris-chan, you're always wearing that cute uniform. What school is it from?" *She inquires, eyeing Kurisu's outfit with interest.*

Kurisu: "Oh, this?" *She lifts her necktie, looking down at her uniform.* "I attended Ayamein for about two weeks. I modeled this outfit after their uniform."

Mayuri: "Oh! Their uniform is really cute, but you made it even cuter! You might have really good design sense♪ I'll bring the costume tomorrow, okay? Will you try it on then?" *She beams, clapping her hands together in delight.*

Kurisu: "Sure." *She responds, her face softening into a small smile.*

Itaru: "When's the photo shoot?" *He asks, a teasing grin on his face.*

Kurisu: "Good to know you're still a pervert, Hashida." *She retorts, rolling her eyes at him.*

Itaru: "Come on, it's Blood Tune's Seira! She's got 'panmoro' going on!" *He explains, his grin never fading.*

Kurisu: "Panmoro?" *She asks, her eyebrows furrowed in confusion.*

Itaru: "It means her panties are completely exposed!" *He answers, chuckling at her reaction.*

Kurisu: "N-no way..." *She stammers, her face turning bright red.*

Mayuri: "It's okay♪ You might not know this, but last year, there was a really popular saying. 'They're not panties, so it's not embarrassing!'" *She reassures, patting Kurisu's shoulder comfortingly.*

Kurisu: "It's plenty embarrassing, trust me!" *She protests, her blush deepening.*

Mayuri: "Wear it, okay? It's a promise!" *She insists, giving Kurisu an expectant look.*

Suzuha: "Maybe you shouldn't bother." *She interjects, her tone sharp and her gaze fixed on Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "What's that supposed to mean?" *She asks, her brows furrowing in annoyance.*

Kurisu: "I've been meaning to ask. Did I do something to you?" *She questions, crossing her arms defensively.*

Suzuha: "Not to me. But I know everything you have done." *She retorts, her gaze never leaving Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "What do you mean? I've done nothing to be guilty of." *She challenges, standing her ground.*

Suzuha: "Perhaps. But I know your true nature." *She states, a cold edge to her voice.*

Kurisu: "Wow, you can see into my heart? That's groundbreaking technology. I'd love to hear how it works." *She retorts, her voice dripping with sarcasm.*

Suzuha: "It's not science. It's... a prediction." *She explains, her expression hard.*

Kurisu: "So you're just making it up." *She concludes, her gaze narrowing at Suzuha.*

Suzuha: "I know." *She affirms, her eyes unwavering.*

Mayuri: "Okarin." *She pleads, turning to me with teary eyes.*

Okabe: "Heh... this looks like a job for the one and only Hououin Kyouma." *I declare, stepping forward to intervene.*

Okabe: "Break it up, you two! I, Hououin Kyouma, shall decide this dispute!" *I announce, positioning myself between the two girls.*

Okabe: "Assistant! I didn't raise you this way." *I admonish, turning to Kurisu with a stern look.*

Kurisu: "You didn't raise me at all." *She retorts, shooting me a glare.*

Okabe: "If you want to become a true mad scientist, you must learn to keep your emotions in check even as you cackle your way to victory!" *I instruct, pointing dramatically at Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "Nobody asked you. And I'm already a scientist." *She dismisses, turning away with a huff.*
