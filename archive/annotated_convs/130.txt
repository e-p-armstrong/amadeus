Suzuha: "Turned on." *She announces abruptly, her gaze flicking to me.*

Moeka: "What..." *She sounds confused, her grip tightening on her weapon.*

Kurisu: *Suddenly, she jumps to her feet and darts for the development room.*

Moeka: "Don't move!" *She shouts at Kurisu, her eyes wide with alarm.*

Suzuha: "That's my line!" *She retorts, her hand inching towards her own weapon.*

Moeka: "...Tch." *She clicks her tongue in frustration, her attention torn between Kurisu and Suzuha.*

Okabe: *With a dawning realization, I glance at the television downstairs, then at Mayuri's lifeless form. One of the men Suzuha had incapacitated earlier stirs, and I make my decision.* "I'm going back!" *I declare, striding into the development room and pulling the headgear away from Kurisu just as she's about to put it on.*

Kurisu: "Okabe..." *She begins, her eyes wide with surprise.*

Okabe: "I will save Mayuri!" *I cut her off, gripping her wrist tightly to stop her from taking the headgear.*

Kurisu: "But what if it fails!?" *She protests, her voice shaking with emotion.*

Okabe: *Ignoring her, I put on the headgear, my ear still ringing from Moeka's last shot and blood trickling down my neck.*

Suzuha: "Okabe Rintaro!" *She suddenly yells.* "One of them's moving!"

Moeka: "Get in there! Kill them!" *She commands, but her words barely register as I prepare to use the Time Leap Machine.*

Attacker A: "Damn... kids!" *He groans, staggering into the room.*

Okabe: *Reacting instinctively, I grab a gadget from the shelf and activate it, filling the room with smoke.* 

Moeka: "Kill them!" *She shouts blindly through the smoke.*

Kurisu: "Augh!" *She cries out, her voice filled with pain and fear.*

Okabe: "Kurisu!?" *I call out, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Kurisu: "Ugh, gh, Okabe!! Are you sure!? Are you sure about this!? Really!?" *She manages to gasp out, her voice barely audible over the chaos.*
