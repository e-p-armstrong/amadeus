Daru: *Clutching his head, he falls to his knees, screaming at the top of his lungs.*

Mayuri: "O...kari..." *Her voice is hardly more than a whisper, her breath ragged.*

Kurisu: "No... no!" *She cries out, shaking her head in disbelief.*

Okabe: *I look down at the lifeless body of my dear friend Mayuri in my arms. My hands are stained with her blood. It's warm.* "She's dead. Mayuri's dead. Again..."

Moeka: "You three come with us. Now. No more warnings. Resist, and we will kill you too." *Her voice cuts through the air like a knife, cold and unyielding.*

Okabe: *Her words barely register in my mind. I carefully lay Mayuri down on the floor, my heart heavy with guilt and regret.* "I'm sorry, Mayuri. I'm so sorry..." *I stand up, rage taking hold of me. I take one menacing step towards Moeka.*

Kurisu: "Okabe!" *She shouts, grabbing my hand before I can take another step.* "You can't!"

Okabe: "Let me go!" *I struggle against her grip, my voice filled with desperation.*

Kurisu: "You can't! They'll kill you!" *Her eyes are wide with fear, her grip on my hand tightening.*

Moeka: *She raises her gun, aiming it directly at my head. Her finger is already on the trigger.* "If you resist."

Okabe: "You gonna kill me too!?" *I challenge her, my voice echoing in the room.*

Kurisu: "Please, Okabe, do what she says. Okay? Otherwise, they'll kill you too." *Her voice is barely more than a whisper, her eyes pleading for understanding.*
