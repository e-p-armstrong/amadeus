Suzuha: "TV." *She says sharply, her eyes darting towards the corner of the room.*

Okabe: *I give her a quick nod, already understanding what she means.* "Turned on." *I rush towards the development room, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Moeka: "Don't move!" *She threatens, her voice ringing out in the tense silence.*

Suzuha: "That's my line!" *Suzuha retorts, her hands clenched into fists.*

Okabe: *As I make it to the development room, I feel Kurisu's presence right behind me.* "Okabe, I--" *She starts to say, but I cut her off.*

Okabe: "I'm going back!" *I declare, hastily jamming the headgear onto my head.*

Kurisu: "But what if it fails!?" *She shoots back, her voice filled with worry.*

Okabe: "Get the machine started!" *I order, grabbing the Moad Snake from the shelf.*

Suzuha: "Okabe Rintaro! One of them's headed your way!" *She shouts a warning.*

Moeka: "Kill them! Don't let them use it!" *Moeka screams, her voice filled with desperation.*

Okabe: *I push the switch just as the crew-cut man enters the room, filling it with a dense white smoke.* "Are you sure, Okabe!? Are you sure about this!? Really!?" *Kurisu's voice is barely audible through the thick smoke.*

Okabe: "Do it, Kurisu! Activate the machine!" *I shout back, bracing myself for the impending time-leap.*

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, the familiar sensation of a time leap taking over.* "Please! Give me one more chance!" *I plead, the world around me exploding into light.*

Okabe: *As the world reforms, I let out a groan, my head throbbing with pain.* "...Gh." *I mumble, my hand instinctively going to my temple.*

Okabe: "...It worked again." *I whisper, relief washing over me as I quickly return to the lounge.*

Kurisu: "Kya! You surprised me!" *She exclaims, startled by my sudden reappearance.*

Okabe: "Daru! Is it just before 5 on the 13th!?" *I rush to ask, my heart still pounding from the time leap.*

Itaru: "Eh? Um... yeah?" *He responds, confusion clear in his tone.*

Okabe: *I give Kurisu a quick pat on the shoulders, a small smile on my face.* "You're a genius."

Kurisu: "W-what's gotten in to you? Stop manhandling me. It's gross." *She protests, pulling away with a disgusted expression.*

Okabe: "Mayuri! Where are--" *I start to ask, only to be cut-off by her voicemail message.* "Mayuri! Contact me at once! Okay? At once!" *I leave her a message, the urgency clear in my voice.*

Okabe: *I check my watch, relief washing over me as I see the time.* "Both of you get out of here. Now." *I order, turning to Kurisu and Daru with a serious expression.*

Kurisu: "...What's this about?" *She asks, a concerned look on her face as I quickly check my wallet.*

Okabe: "Is this another one of your fantasies?" *She inquires, her tone filled with worry and confusion.*
