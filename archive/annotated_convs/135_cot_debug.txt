Okabe: *I wince as I activate the X68000 and input the settings, my hands shaking uncontrollably. The sound of police sirens in the distance only add to my urgency.*

Okabe: *With my heart pounding in my chest, I put on the headgear, blood staining the fabric.* "Of course I should." *I mutter to myself, fighting back the tears threatening to spill over.*

Okabe: "Mayuri's dead, remember?" *I remind myself, the words a bitter pill to swallow. No risk is too great. I have to save her, whatever it takes.* 

Okabe: *With a final surge of determination, I activate the Time Leap Machine.* "Gah!" *I cry out as pain explodes in my head, my vision blurring momentarily.*

Okabe: *As the world comes back into focus, I find myself sitting on the sofa, my wounds healed as if by magic. Relief washes over me as I realize the time leap was successful.* "Where's Mayuri!?" *I demand, my voice echoing in the empty lab.*

Kurisu: *Suddenly, Kurisu enters the room, her eyes wide with surprise.* "Wha!?" *She stammers, clearly taken aback by my sudden outburst.*
