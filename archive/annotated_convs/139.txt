Okabe: *With a heavy sigh, I start to voice my regrets.* "I shouldn't have told Daru to hack SERN. I shouldn't have asked you to build a time machine. I shouldn't have made Moeka a lab mem. Mayuri's death...is all my fault." 

Kurisu: "If you know that Mayuri's going to die, then what are you doing wasting time here?" *She says, her tone sharp, almost mimicking my own Hououin Kyouma persona.*

Okabe: "...I just don't get it anymore." *I admit, my voice barely a whisper.*

Kurisu: "What don't you get?" *She asks, her brows furrowing in concern.*

Okabe: "How to save Mayuri." *I confess, my voice filled with desperation and despair.*

Kurisu: "Based on what you said, I guess the chronology protection conjecture is true." *She muses, trying to make sense of my situation.*

Okabe: "No matter what I do, Mayuri dies." *I say, my voice choked with emotion.*

Kurisu: "And that's why you keep time leaping... There's no guarantee that the machine is safe, you know." *She warns, her gaze dropping to her hands.*

Kurisu: *She looks up, a thoughtful expression on her face.* "Even if the machine works perfectly, repeated use may have serious side effects. For example, you may become disconnected from causality itself. You need to understand the risks if you're going to continue."

Okabe: "Disconnected from causality, meaning?" *I ask, trying to grasp the full gravity of her words.*

Kurisu: "It happens all the time in sci-fi. You'll become trapped in a closed time loop, never aging, never dying, but doomed to repeat the same day for all eternity. Worst case, you may cease to exist entirely." *She explains, her voice filled with deadly seriousness.*

Okabe: "Every trace of your existence will vanish. Nobody will remember you, because your life will have never happened. Leaping through time is that dangerous." *I repeat her words, my mind spinning with the implications.*

Okabe: "'Humans are temporal beings.'" *I murmur, recalling a shared memory.*

Kurisu: "Heidegger. I was thinking of that quote too." *She says, a hint of surprise in her voice.*

Okabe: "I heard it from you first." *I admit, a faint smile tugging at my lips.*

Kurisu: "When?" *She asks, curiosity piqued.*

Okabe: "This isn't the first time I've leaped." *I respond, my tone oddly calm.*

Kurisu: "Right. Of course." *She nods, her expression thoughtful as she squats next to me.*

Kurisu: "If what you said is true, then I want to save Mayuri too. But as the co-creator of the Time Leap Machine, I can't recommend its continued use. Will you listen to my advice?" *She asks, her eyes meeting mine.*

Okabe: "I..." *I hesitate, grappling with my own desperation.* "I need your help. I have to save Mayuri! I can't do it alone, but together, we might have a chance. I want... I need to believe that! Please, lend me your strength." 

Kurisu: "You're such a stubborn fool. What you've been through... I'm surprised it hasn't broken you already." *She sighs, her tone filled with concern and a hint of admiration.*

Kurisu: "I'll help. Mayuri's my friend, and a fellow lab mem. And besides... I don't want to see you in such pain." *She says, her voice softening as she turns away, seemingly embarrassed.*

Okabe: "I'm sorry." *I apologize, my voice barely a whisper.*

Kurisu: "Don't apologize. Remember when I told you about my father? You really helped me out back then. Now it's my turn to return the favor. I want to be your strength. Besides, you still have to come with me to Aomori." *She says, her tone determined and encouraging.*

Kurisu: "I know you're going to leap no matter what I say. You are a mad scientist, after all, and mad scientists play by their own rules. Hey. Aren't you supposed to go 'muhahahaha' or something?" *She teases, trying to lighten the mood.*

Okabe: "Yeah..." *I say, managing a weak chuckle.*

Kurisu: "Why do I even try?" *She sighs, shaking her head in mock exasperation.*

Okabe: "Anyway, I'm not doing this for you, okay? I'm doing it for Mayuri." *I say, nodding in understanding.*

Kurisu: "That, and I think you'll make a good test subject." *She adds, a mischievous glint in her eyes.*

Okabe: "Now you're talking like SERN." *I say, raising an eyebrow.*

Kurisu: "It's completely different." *She argues, crossing her arms defensively.*

Okabe: "How so?" *I ask, intrigued.*

Kurisu: "I only experiment on you. Besides, mad scientists experiment on themselves all the time, don't they?" *She retorts, a smirk playing on her lips.*
