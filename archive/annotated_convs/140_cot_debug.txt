Okabe: *I exhale deeply, my resolve hardening.* "I'm no longer afraid to time leap. I'll do anything to save Mayuri."

Kurisu: "I-it's just a joke. Don't take it so seriously." *She tries to lighten the mood, but I can see the worry in her eyes.*

Kurisu: *She stands up, her eyes flickering to her watch.* "There's not much time. I think you should have a clear plan before trying to change the future again."

Okabe: "Meaning?" *I question, my brow furrowing in confusion.*

Kurisu: "Leap to an even earlier time. Then explain the situation to me again." *She suggests, her tone serious and determined.*

Okabe: *Nodding, I agree.* "You're right. My actions so far have been almost entirely random, and look where that's gotten me. I need a real plan if I'm going to save Mayuri."

Kurisu: *She stretches out her hand.* "Let's go." *I grasp it and pull myself up.*

Okabe: *Returning to the lab, I see Mayuri, Daru, and Suzuha are already back.* "We forgot to do the shopping, could you please take care of it for us?" *I ask, hoping to clear the lab for our operation.*

Kurisu: "I understand why you can't tell Mayuri, but why can't you tell Hashida?" *She questions, her eyes narrowing slightly.*

Okabe: "I'll tell him when it's necessary." *I respond, my gaze focused on the task at hand.*

Okabe: *I head downstairs to the Braun Tube Workshop, kick the door open, and turn on the 42-inch CRT.* "That went more smoothly than I anticipated." 

Kurisu: "They'll throw you in the slammer for breaking and entering." *She exclaims, her eyes wide with surprise.*

Okabe: "In a few seconds, it won't have happened." *I reassure her, slipping on the headgear.*

Kurisu: "I see. That's how it looks from your perspective. What does it look like from my perspective? What happens here after you leap?" *She asks, her curiosity piqued.*

Okabe: "...You'll know soon enough." *I respond, my gaze drifting away thoughtfully.*

Okabe: "Maybe it works like a D-Mail." *I muse aloud, trying to reassure both of us.*

Kurisu: "That would make things easier, though I kind of hope you're wrong." *She responds, her gaze focused on the machine.*

Kurisu: "I set the destination to five hours ago. You should arrive around 1:40 PM. I completed the Time Leap Machine just after 2. Do you remember?" *She asks, turning towards me.*

Okabe: *Barely remembering, I nod.* "Barely. For you, that happened only five hours ago. For me, it feels like weeks.  Maybe it has been weeks."

Kurisu: "Nobody likes a man who can't remember dates. Be thankful that I make a habit of checking the time. I have a pretty good idea what happened when." *She teases, her eyes sparkling with determination.*

Kurisu: "Listen, Okabe. If you're going to keep using the Time Leap Machine, there's one thing you must remember. Don't let go of your phone. Ever. It's your lifeline. Your destination marker. As long as you keep it with you, you can leap to any time you want. But if you lose your phone... if someone else gets ahold of it..." *She warns, her tone serious and stern.*

Okabe: *The gravity of her words hit me.* "If it breaks, or the battery dies..."
