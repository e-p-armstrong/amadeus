Kurisu: "The time leap will fail. Once again, never let go of your phone." *She points at the device in my hand, her expression serious.*

Okabe: "Got it." *I nod, clutching my phone tighter.*

Kurisu: "After you leap back to this afternoon, just sit tight and don't do anything until I complete the Time Leap Machine..." *She rattles off a series of instructions, counting off on her fingers as she goes.*

Okabe: "How do you know?" *I ask, raising an eyebrow.*

Kurisu: "Who knows me better than myself?" *She grins faintly and stands up after she's done typing.* "Don't forget. It was my mad skillz that turned the PhoneWave into a time leap machine..."

Okabe: *I listen, my mind whirling.* "I see..."

Kurisu: "Just to be safe, I should probably give you a passphrase. What I want the most right now is my own fork."

Okabe: "...What?" *I blink at her in surprise.*

Kurisu: "It doesn't mean anything, okay!?" *She waves her hands dismissively.* "Everything's ready! Now get out of here!"

Okabe: *I nod and call up the PhoneWave (name subject to change), watching as she works.*

Kurisu: "Be careful. And remember... I'm always on your side." *She touches my shoulder, then steps away.*

Mayuri: "Okarin, Okarin! Can you come here?" *Mayuri waves me over, holding up her costume.*

Okabe: *I follow her directions and spread the costume out by the sleeves.* "Hmm... Okay! Thanks."

Mayuri: "All doneâ™ª" *She claps her hands together, her face lighting up.*

Okabe: *I try to remember what I said here, but I can't remember.*

Mayuri: "I finished before Chris-chan! We were racing."

Kurisu: "You win, Mayuri. Congratulations. But I'm finished too." *She finishes connecting the two cords she's holding.* "Complete."

Okabe: "We're not experimenting." *I blurt out, my heart pounding.*

Kurisu: "Eh!?" *She spins around in surprise.* "I just finished and you're already shutting it down? What I have been doing these past three days?"

Okabe: "Time leaping presents a host of problems. I want to consider them all carefully." *I say, trying to sound as calm as possible.*

Kurisu: "H-huh. That's... an unusually respectable opinion, coming from you." *She stammers, her eyebrows raised in surprise.*
