Okabe: "Are you upset?" *I ask, my voice filled with concern.*

Kurisu: "...Yeah." *She sighs deeply, her shoulders slumping in disappointment.*

Okabe: *"I came from five hours in the future." I proclaim, looking straight into her eyes.*

Kurisu: *"Is that supposed to be funny?" She retorts, her eyes narrowing in skepticism.*

Okabe: "D-don't glare like that! This isn't right! You're supposed to believe me!" *I stammer, taken aback by her intense gaze.*

Kurisu: "What made you think I'd believe something like that!?" *She snaps, throwing her hands up in exasperation.*

Okabe: "You told me so! Five hours from now, okay!?" *I insist, my hands clenched into fists by my sides.*

Kurisu: "Don't be ridiculous. I would never make such a baseless projection." *She scoffs, crossing her arms defensively.*

Okabe: "When I told you about my time leap, you said, 'I took it as proof that my theories were right. I didn't doubt it was true for a second.' 'Don't forget. It was my mad skillz that turned the PhoneWave into a time leap machine.'" *I recount, mimicking her future voice.*

Kurisu: "I don't talk like that!" *She protests, her face turning a shade redder.*

Okabe: "What you want most right now is your own fork!" *I blurt out, a smirk playing on my lips.*

Kurisu: "Wha--" *She stammers, her face suddenly turning a bright red.*

Okabe: "You already have your own spoon, apparently." *I add, chuckling at her flustered reaction.*

Kurisu: "S-she said that? I'm gonna kill myself five hours from now..." *She mutters, her eyes wide in shock.*

Kurisu: "It feels like someone peeked into my heart. And that someone is Okabe, of all people." *She admits, giving me a thoughtful look.*

Okabe: *"I explain everything to Kurisu again, my words coming out more easily this time.*

Kurisu: "I see... If what you say is true, then we have a serious problem." *She murmurs, her brows furrowed in deep thought.*

Okabe: "So I was right. The universe itself is censoring me, correcting any changes I try to make." *I state, my face grim.*

Kurisu: "If that's true, then time leaping can't save Mayuri. Nothing you do will change the result." *She says, her voice flat and devoid of hope.*

Okabe: "...I can't accept that." *I declare, clenching my fists in determination.*

Kurisu: "Neither can I. The world is trying to kill Mayuri? As a scientist, I refuse to believe such nonsense." *She says, her eyes shining with resolve.*

Okabe: "What about the many-worlds interpretation? I just need to observe the world where Mayuri doesn't die." *I suggest, looking at her expectantly.*

Kurisu: "The many-worlds interpretation... That might have something to do with how Mayuri's means of death keeps changing. But it's supposed to be impossible for parallel worlds to observe each other. Why are you different?" *She asks, her gaze intense and questioning.*

Okabe: "Because of my esper power, Reading Steiner." *I state confidently.*

Kurisu: "This is no time for your chuunibyou nonsense." *She scolds, rolling her eyes.*

Okabe: "...There's no other explanation." *I insist, my voice firm.*

Kurisu: "You've mentioned that Reading Steiner thing before. Were you actually serious?" *She asks, her expression suddenly serious.*

Okabe: "Why would I make up something like that?" *I respond, meeting her gaze.*

Kurisu: "I don't know, but I don't want to rely on something that may not even exist. Anyway, you can't control which possibilities you observe. Even if the many-worlds interpretation holds true, it's unreasonable to expect that you'll ever find a world where Mayuri doesn't die." *She concludes, her eyes filled with resolve and determination.*
