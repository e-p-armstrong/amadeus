Itaru: *He sighs in relief, rubbing the back of his neck with a sheepish smile.* 

Kurisu: "Amane-san. You said that most of what you posted as John Titor was true, right?" *She leans forward, her eyes sharp with curiosity.*

Suzuha: "Right."

Kurisu: "Does that mean you know how the universe works? You claimed that the Everett-Wheeler model -- the many-worlds interpretation -- is correct." *She raises an eyebrow, challenging Suzuha's claim.*

Suzuha: "That was a lie. Camouflage so that SERN wouldn't target me. If I mix one lie into the truth, then the bad apple spoils the barrel." *She shrugs, a hint of sadness in her eyes.*

Kurisu: "So you don't know." *She says, a hint of disappointment in her voice.*

Suzuha: "I do. By 2036, scientists have successfully modeled the structure of the universe. And it's not the many-worlds interpretation." *She nods, a confident smile on her face.*

Kurisu: "Really? Tell me!" *She leans in even closer, her eyes sparkling with excitement.*

Okabe: "Attractor Fields..." *I interject, my voice low and thoughtful.*

Suzuha: "Right. I told you by mail, didn't I?" *She looks at me, her gaze understanding.*

Kurisu: "What sort of model is that?" *She asks, her tone eager.*

Suzuha: "The universe is made up of worldlines and attractor fields." *She begins, picking up a ball of red yarn from the table.*

Suzuha: *She holds one end of the yarn and drops the ball to the floor.* "The universe is like this piece of yarn. Countless possible worldlines exist side by side, branching out to infinity. From a distance, it looks like a single string, but when you look closer, the string is actually made up of individual threads woven together. At the end, those threads converge on a single point. The paths are different, but the destination is the same." *She explains, demonstrating with the yarn.*

Kurisu: "Isn't that determinism?" *She asks, her eyebrows furrowed in concentration.*

Suzuha: "Close. This model is a little looser. You could say it cherry-picks from the many-worlds interpretation and the Copenhagen interpretation." *She says, her voice calm and patient.*

Okabe: "If the branches all lead to the same place, does that mean there's only one world in the end?" *I question, my tone hinting at uncertainty.*

Suzuha: "Exactly. The bundle of worldlines that share a point of convergence is called an attractor field. There are also many attractor fields. This string is Attractor Field Alpha. The threads are Alpha worldlines." *She cuts meter lengths of blue, yellow, and white yarn, twisting them together to form a multicolored string.* 

Itaru: "Can you compare it to an eroge? Teach me, oh erotic one." *He asks, a cheeky grin on his face.*

Kurisu: "T-there's no erotic one here!" *She exclaims, her face turning red.*

Okabe: "No, he's right. It is like an eroge. Each heroine's route is an attractor field, and the small choices within are the individual worldlines. But at the end, they all enter the true route for the grand ending." *I say, nodding in agreement with Itaru.*

Itaru: "The only difference is the length of the common parts. By the way, I'd choose the little sister's attractor field." *He shrugs, a mischievous glint in his eyes.*

Okabe: "Whatever." *I roll my eyes, a smirk on my face.*

Kurisu: "You guys are hopeless. Better do something quick." *She sighs, shaking her head in disbelief.*

Suzuha: "Umm, I don't know what you guys are talking about..." *She says, looking confused.*

Kurisu: "Just ignore them." *She advises Suzuha, waving a dismissive hand at Itaru and me.*

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, looking at the multicolored string.* "Let me get this straight. The reason I can't save Mayuri... is that her death is the event upon which this attractor field converges? But that means... That means the world really is killing Mayuri." 

Itaru: "But then, isn't it impossible to change the future? It always converges in the end, right? No matter what you do, the result is the same." *He asks, his smile fading into a worried frown.*

Suzuha: "We have to escape Attractor Field Alpha." *She says, her tone serious.*

Okabe: "Escape?" *I ask, my heart pounding.*

Suzuha: "In other words, we're going to jump to a worldline in Attractor Field Beta." *She explains, her gaze steady.*

Kurisu: "I thought attractor fields couldn't interact." *She says, her voice filled with doubt.*
