*Suzuha looks at each of us, her gaze hardened by the weight of her mission.* 

Suzuha: "...It was written in Dad's will."

Mayuri: *She tilts her head, her brows furrowed.* "What do you mean?"

Suzuha: *She takes a deep breath, steadying herself before revealing her story.* "His will was what made me decide to time travel. My dad was one of the founding members of the Resistance. He hid from SERN and researched time travel on his own. He wanted to change the future. But SERN killed him. That's why I'm here. To fulfill his dream."

Kurisu: *She looks down, her voice soft.* "...I'm sorry."

*Suzuha stays silent, her resentment towards Kurisu still palpable. Though I know Kurisu would never betray us, I can't bring myself to defend her in front of Suzuha. As I watch them, I can't help but wonder why Suzuha doesn't just kill Kurisu if she's so convinced Kurisu is to blame. But then I remember Mayuri and how I couldn't save her. Maybe Suzuha faces the same issue. With that thought, Suzuha starts talking again.*

Suzuha: "Akihabara, 2010. The time machine created here accelerates SERN's own time machine research. We have to stop that from happening in order to guide history in a new direction."

Itaru: *He looks at Suzuha, uncertainty clear in his eyes.* "Stop it? How?"

Okabe: *I interject, reminding everyone of the gravity of our situation.* "SERN already knows about us."

*Suzuha nods, her gaze firm on us.*

Suzuha: "Dad believed that the ultimate cause was the very first email you sent with your time machine."

Okabe: *I frown, confused by her claim.* "An email? It wasn't because they caught us hacking?"

Itaru: *He snorts, confident as always in his skills.* "Like I said, nobody can catch my hacking."

Kurisu: *She looks at Suzuha, her brows furrowed in confusion.* "Which email are you talking about?"

Mayuri: *She pipes up suddenly, her eyes brightening with realization.* "Um, I know! Wasn't it the email Okarin sent that said Chris-chan died?"

*Her words take me back to the day of Doctor Nakabachi's conference. The day I sent Daru the email about Kurisu.*

Kurisu: *She looks at me, a look of realization crossing her face.* "Oh, that..."
