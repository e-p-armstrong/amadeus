Okabe: *I am cut off mid-sentence by a stern voice.* "You three." *I freeze in place.*

Policeman: "What are these leaflets about? Let's talk at the station." *He steps forward, arms crossed.*

Mayuri: "Ehh?" *She gasps, her eyes wide with shock.*

Okabe: *I quickly grab Suzuha's arm, stopping her.* "Better just to bite the bullet and go along." *An hour later, we're released without charges. As we enter the lab, Kurisu greets us.* 

Kurisu: "Hey, Okabe, remember the lifter? I don't suppose you've figured out what it is... no, of course you haven't." *She teases, glancing at me curiously.*

Okabe: "I already know. It's the 42-inch CRT downstairs." *I reply, trying to sound confident.*

Kurisu: "R-really? What's your proof?" *She asks, her brows furrowing.*

Okabe: "I've been here before, remember?" *I remind her, hoping she'll believe me.*

Kurisu: "...Oh, right. The CRT... I see..." *She nods, understanding dawning on her face, and heads back into the development room.*

Mayuri: "I'm sorry, guys. I made things worse..." *She apologizes, her voice barely above a whisper.*

Okabe: *I hand Mayuri a piece of chicken, hoping it will cheer her up.* "There's not much time left. What else can we do before the time limit?"

Kurisu: "Hello." *She answers the phone, her voice calm and collected.*

Okabe: "Assistant? It's me." *I greet her, trying to sound casual.*

Kurisu: "Oh, I think you got the wrong number." *She sounds confused, clearly not recognizing my voice.*

Okabe: "What are you saying? It's me, Hououin Kyouma." *I insist, a bit frustrated.*

Kurisu: "My name isn't Assistant. And your name isn't Hououin Kyouma." *She retorts, her tone icy.*

Okabe: "Would you prefer to be called 'KuriGohan and Kamehameha'?" *I tease, trying to lighten the mood.*

Kurisu: "Bwah!?" *She chokes on the phone, clearly caught off guard.*

Okabe: "Before I time leaped, you made a tearful confession. You said, 'I'm an @channeler, a Nicojunkie, and a camwhore who posts tits, but will you still accept me as your assistant?' And I, of course, replied... 'You may be an @channeler, a Nicojunkie, and a camwhore who posts tits, but you're still a member of this lab. And that makes you my assistant, now and forever. So wipe your tears, for there is still much--'" *I recount our previous conversation, trying to convince her.*

Kurisu: "I'm gonna post your personal info all over VIP if you don't shut your mouth right this second!" *She threatens, her voice shaking with anger.*

Okabe: "...How are things there?" *I change the subject, trying to calm her down.*

Kurisu: "Fine. You called at the right time. We need to talk." *She replies, her voice back to its usual calm.*

Okabe: "I'll be right there." *I end the call and turn to Suzuha.* "Let's go back to the lab." *When we enter, Kurisu is there, waiting.*

Kurisu: "For your information, I don't post t...ti... I don't post pictures of my chest, okay!?" *She insists, blushing furiously.*

Okabe: "It was just a joke. Let it die." *I wave her off, trying to avoid further conflict.*

Suzuha: "Kurigohan and Kamehameha... so you're the one who kept picking fights with me on the internet. Makes sense." *She muses, a smirk playing on her lips.*

Kurisu: "I thought you wanted an open discussion." *She retorts, crossing her arms defensively.*

Suzuha: "Sure. You were kind of annoying, though." *She shrugs, not at all bothered by Kurisu's defensive stance.*

Kurisu: "Hehehe..." *She chuckles, clearly amused by Suzuha's comment.*

Suzuha: "Ahaha!" *She laughs, joining in on the joke.*

Okabe: "By the way, it may shock you to learn that I am the poster known as Hououin Kyou--" *I start, hoping to surprise them.*

Kurisu & Suzuha: "I know." *They interrupt me, their voices in unison.*

Okabe: *Slightly taken aback, I clear my throat.* "So, what did you want to talk about? The Time Leap Machine?"

Kurisu: "I think you probably forgot, so I wanted to make sure just in case. Have you been looking for the lifter? You haven't, have you?" *She asks, her gaze intense.*

Okabe: "I already know. It's the 42-inch CRT downstairs." *I repeat, hoping to convince her.*

Kurisu: "R-really? What's your proof?" *She looks at me, her eyes searching for any signs of deception.*

Okabe: "I've been here before, remember?" *I remind her, my gaze steady.*

Kurisu: "I see..." *She nods, finally accepting my explanation.*
