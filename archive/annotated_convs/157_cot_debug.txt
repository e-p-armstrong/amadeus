Okabe: "Anything else?" *I ask, scratching my head in confusion.*

Master: "Um? Maybe a judo fighter? Or, pro wrestler?" *He suggests, looking uncertain.*

Okabe: "What? Judo? Pro wrestler?" *I furrow my brows, trying to make sense of his words.* "What do you mean by that?"

Master: "YES!" *His exclamation only adds to my confusion.*

Okabe: *An exasperated sigh escapes my lips.* "That wasn't a yes/no question. What the hell do you mean!?"

Master: "Ahh, balloon. Was balloon!" *He blurts out, before suddenly spotting a policeman and running off.*

Okabe: "Balloon? Judo? Pro wrestling?" *I mutter to myself, watching him run off.* "No! Not good! Are you trying to confuse me!?" 

Kurisu: *She interrupts my frustrated mumbling.* "Done." *She states, connecting two cords together.*

Okabe: *Looking over at the clock, I realize we've made progress.* "The Time Leap Machine is complete. It's 2:30 PM on the 13th, about 20 minutes later than before."

Suzuha: "So that's the Time Leap Machine..." *She gazes at the machine in awe, taking in the sight of our creation.*

Okabe: "It makes you remember the future, right?" *I explain, following her gaze to the machine.*

Suzuha: "Intuition... sixth sense... deja vu... I wonder if those things are actually you recalling future memories." *She muses, crossing her hands behind her head.*

Kurisu: "I just wish we knew more about Okabe's Reading Steiner thing. Is it unique to Okabe? Or does everyone have the potential for it, and Okabe's is just stronger by coincidence?" *She asks, turning to face me.*

Okabe: "One thing's for certain. My consciousness leaps to the past along with my memories." *I state, trying to simplify the complex process.*

Kurisu: "I still don't understand why that is. It would make more sense if you experienced a change in the present, like you do when we send a D-Mail. Does your consciousness depend on your memories?" *She questions, her brows furrowed in thought.*

Suzuha: "The problem is that consciousness doesn't have a form that we can see. Same goes for the soul. Those things are still in the realm of religion." *She shrugs, looking back at the machine.*

Kurisu: "I see... that's a little disappointing." *She sighs, clearly unsatisfied with the lack of concrete explanations.*

Okabe: "Sending my consciousness back has let me change some future events with more precision than D-Mail, but other events are locked in by convergence."

Suzuha: "That's not how it works. The future is always determined." *She contradicts, shaking her head slightly.*

Okabe: "Then why does the path there change?" *I challenge, needing to understand the intricacies of the process.*

Suzuha: "Because the worldline changes. When you leap into the past and take different actions from before, divergence changes, if only a little bit." *She explains, her gaze focused on me.*

Okabe: *I pause, taking in her words.* "So is that why Reading Steiner didn't react?"

Suzuha: "It's not like the previous worldline disappears. It keeps existing as another possible worldline." *She adds, reinforcing her previous statement.*

Kurisu: "That's the many-worlds interpretation, right?" *She asks, connecting the dots in her head.*
