Okabe: "What if we ask you to stay?" *I voice my concern, my eyes pleading for her to reconsider.*

Suzuha: "I'll go anyway. One of those guys on @channel asked what right I have to change the future and decide the fate of the human race. He had a point. But still..." *She looks out into the distance, her gaze distant yet determined.* "I don't want the future to turn out like that. I want the people in my time to be free like you. Free to laugh and play, fight and argue, get sad and cry. If I change the future, then no one will die. Not you, not Shiina Mayuri, and not my dad. Maybe I don't have the right... but I'm going anyway."

Okabe: "Even if you can never return?" *I ask, my voice filled with worry.*

Suzuha: "Aw, come on! The 70s aren't a bad time, you know? I'll find friends there just like you guys. We'll have a blast!" *She grins, trying to lighten the mood, but her eyes betray her.*

Okabe: *I watch as the time machine hums to life, my heart heavy. I help Mayuri drain the last of the water out of the cockpit, my mind filled with doubts.*

Kurisu: *She runs over, her face a mask of relief as she sees the time machine functioning properly.*

Suzuha: "Thanks, guys... really. I can't thank you enough." *Suzuha says, securing her bicycle to the time machine.*

Mayuri: "Don't forget about us!" *She cries out, her voice trembling with emotion.*

Itaru: "If you want to thank me, then let's make out." *Daru jokes, trying to lighten the somber mood.*

Kurisu: "Control yourself, perv." *She scolds Daru, her face flushed, but her eyes soft with understanding.*

Suzuha: "Oh right. Take this." *She hands me her father's pin, her eyes meeting mine for a moment.* "This is for you, Okabe Rintaro. Keep it in the lab, will you? Somewhere out of sight is fine."

Okabe: "Suzuha..." *I whisper, my fingers closing around the pin. I can't help but wonder if this is her way of leaving a part of her with us.*

Itaru: "Um... about the pin." *Daru interrupts, stepping forward hesitantly.* "Why don't we make duplicates for all the lab mems? Make it our symbol, I guess."

Mayuri: "Wow! That's a great idea!" *She cheers, her eyes shining with excitement.*

Kurisu: "How unusually thoughtful of you." *She adds, a small smile playing on her lips, her gaze softening as she looks at Daru.*
