Okabe: "Th-that naming sense... it's got to be Daru!" *I exclaim, my eyes wide in realization.*

Mayuri: "And FG probably stands for Future Gadget." *She contributes happily, her finger tapping her chin in thought.*

Okabe: *I gasp, pointing at Mayuri in surprise.* "So Suzuha's time machine... is Future Gadget No. 204!?"

Mayuri: "Finally, his name. Barrel Titor has to be Daru-kun!" *She announces triumphantly, her eyes shining with excitement.*

Kurisu: "Come to think of it, last night, Mayuri asked how to say 'barrel' in Japanese." *She mumbles, a thoughtful frown on her face as she recalls the previous night's conversation.*

Mayuri: "Barrel is 'taru' in Japanese. Right, Chris-chan?" *She turns to Kurisu, seeking confirmation.*

Kurisu: *She nods, her eyes narrowed in concentration.* "Yes, that's correct."

Okabe: "Taru... Taru... Daru!?" *I stammer, my mind racing to keep up with the rapid revelations.*

Suzuha: "It's a pun!?" *She blurts out, her eyes wide with shock.*

Mayuri: "Okay, Suzu-san! Say 'Hashida Itaru' ten times fast!" *She instructs Suzuha, her eyes sparkling with mischief.*

Suzuha: "Wh-why?" *She stammers, clearly confused by the sudden request.*

Mayuri: "Just say it and find out! Ehehe!" *She giggles, clapping her hands together in anticipation.*

Suzuha: *She takes a deep breath, then starts rattling off the string of words.* "HashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaru[linebreak]HashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaru"

Mayuri: "Just now, didn't it sound like 'Ditor'?" *She asks, her eyes wide with excitement.*

Kurisu: "It did." *She agrees, nodding slowly as she processes the information.*

Mayuri: *She proceeds to break down the word play, her hands moving as she explains.* "Hashidaitaru. Hashi-daita-ru. Hashi-Ditor-ru. Hashi-Titor-ru."

Itaru: "...For reals?" *He asks, his voice barely above a whisper.*

Mayuri: "For super realsâ™ª" *She assures him, her smile broad and genuine.*

Okabe: *I can't help but laugh, clapping Mayuri on the shoulder.* "Nice work, Mayuri! You'll make a great detective one day."

Mayuri: "A d-detective? Ehehe! That's the first time anyone's said that." *She blushes, her eyes sparkling with delight.*

Itaru: "My... d-daughter? Amane-shi is my daughter?" *He stammers, his eyes wide with disbelief.*

Suzuha: "Dad..." *She murmurs, her voice filled with a mix of relief and uncertainty.*

Itaru: "Uh... c-c-could you call me Papa instead?" *He asks, a hopeful smile on his face.*

Kurisu: "For once in your life, don't be a perv..." *She admonishes, rolling her eyes in exasperation.*
