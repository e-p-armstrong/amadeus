Suzuha: *She looks at us, her eyes filled with determination.* "I'll bring it to you here in Akihabara. That's my duty, and I'll see it through. The rest is up to you. Change the future. Please." 

Okabe: *We stand still, our faces mirroring her resolve. We don't need to speak, our silence is our vow.*

Suzuha: "Well, see you in 35 years... though I guess it'll only be a few hours for you guys. Ahaha! Oh, I almost forgot. The time machine gives off terrific ultraviolet rays when it jumps, so make sure not to look directly at it." *She boards the time machine, waving to us one last time before disappearing inside.*

Okabe: *I pull out my phone as it vibrates, reading the message from Suzuha. I look up just in time to see the time machine enveloped in light.* "Suzuha..."

Itaru: *As the light grows, Daru steps forward, shouting into the brilliance.* "S-Suzuha!! I'm sure we'll meet again! I'll do my best until then! I hate myself for not knowing any other way to say it, but I'll do my best! I'll do my best, I promise! So Suzuha, do your best too!"

Okabe: *As the machine disappears, we can only look on in stunned silence, the empty space a stark reminder of what we've lost. But we can't afford to lose ourselves in grief, we have a mission to complete.*

Kurisu: "Haah, whew... whew... no more... running..." *She pants, bent over with hands on her knees, clearly exhausted from the sudden chaos.*
