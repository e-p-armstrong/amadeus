Itaru: "My daughter is 30 years older than me. I don't know if I want to see that. Feels weird, man." *He admits, nervously scratching his head.*

Kurisu: "You know, it wouldn't be unusual for her to have grandchildren by that age." *She adds thoughtfully, her gaze distant as she considers the implications.*

Itaru: "Y-you mean I could have great-grandkids? I don't know if I'm ready for that, man..." *He responds, his eyes widening at the prospect.*

Mayuri: "Just be super nice to them! That's what grandpas do!" *She chimes in, her face lighting up with enthusiasm.*

Itaru: "Please, don't call me grandpa..." *He pleads, burying his face in his hands in exasperation.*

Okabe: *Suddenly, a knock on the door interrupts our conversation, I exchange a glance with Kurisu before slowly opening the door.* "Oh, it's you..."

Tennouji: "Okabe!" *He greets, his large frame filling the doorway.*

Okabe: *I step back, a small sigh escaping my lips.* "Hey, have you seen my part-timer?"

Tennouji: *He peers curiously into the lab, his gaze sweeping over each of us.*

Mayuri: "If you're looking for Suzu-san, she went 35 years--" *She begins, her voice full of innocent enthusiasm.*

Kurisu: *Panicking, she quickly cuts Mayuri off.* "Shaddup, Mayuri!"
