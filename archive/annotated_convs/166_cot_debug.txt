Okabe: "Kurisu. You're good at remembering dates, aren't you?" *I ask, my voice wavering slightly as I look at her.*

Kurisu: "Huh? Well, sure..." *She responds, confusion evident in her voice.*

Okabe: "When did we throw that party for Suzuha?" *I ask, my fingers nervously tapping on the keyboard of the PhoneWave.*

Kurisu: "Four days ago. August 9th." *She answers, a hint of suspicion in her tone.*

Mayuri: "You're sending a D-Mail, Okarin?" *Her voice trembles with concern.* "But won't that make everything disappear?" 

Okabe: *I nod, my heart heavy with the weight of the decision I'm about to make.* 

Mayuri: "Are you sure!?" *She asks, her voice choked with tears.* "Our memories with Suzu-san will disappear! Is that really okay?" 

Okabe: *I look at her, my eyes reflecting the pain and turmoil within me. I can't find the words to answer her.* 

Suzuha: "Being with you guys, even for just a little while... was great. I'm going to finish what you started, Dad. I promise. Well, see you in 35 years... though I guess it'll only be a few hours for you guys. Ahaha! Change the future. Please." *Her voice echoes in my mind, a painful reminder of the choice I must make.*

Okabe: *I place my hand on the time leap headgear, my fingers trembling.* "I... I can't do it." *I make my decision and punch in a 48-hour time leap.*

Kurisu: "Do you have a plan?" *She asks, her voice full of concern for what's about to unfold.*
