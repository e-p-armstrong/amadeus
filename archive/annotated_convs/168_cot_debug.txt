Okabe: "Mister Braun gave it to me. It's a device that can measure the divergence of worldlines." *I hold out the device in my hand for Mayuri to see.*

Mayuri: "Wow, that sounds amazing... what's a worldline?" *She tilts her head in confusion, her eyes wide with curiosity.*

Okabe: *I chuckle softly, shaking my head at her innocence.* "Mayuri, you really are a dummy. Just a thought, Mayuri, but don't you think maybe you should stop coming to Akiba for a while? At least until ComiMa ends."

Kurisu: *Watching the exchange, she steps forward, ice coffee in hand.* "So you're the devoted type, huh?"

Okabe: *I turn towards her, surprised by her comment.* "What's that supposed to mean?" *I ask, turning back to the computer and continuing my search for intel on the IBN 5100.*

Kurisu: "All of a sudden, you're treating Mayuri like a princess. Today you went to the station to meet her, you taste tested her lunch, and then you held her hand all the way back to the lab." *She states, leaning against the table and watching me intently.*

Mayuri: "Okarin really loves Mayushii! Ehehe!" *She chimes in, giggling as she stuffs her cheeks with takoyaki.*

Kurisu: "So what's the deal? Are you a couple or what? I've been meaning to ask." *She asks, her gaze shifting between Mayuri and me.*

Okabe: "Do we look like a couple?" *I raise an eyebrow in question, my attention still on the computer screen.*

Kurisu: "Huh!? Uh... well... umm..." *She stammers, her face flushing slightly.*

Mayuri: "You know, Okarin and Mayushii have been friends since we were littleâ™ª Mwawoohii's weeally hwawy nawo." *She explains, her words muffled by the food in her mouth.*

Okabe: "Don't talk with your mouth full." *I chide her gently, finally tearing my gaze away from the computer.*

Kurisu: "So... you're not a couple. Oh. Well, of course! No one would willingly date Okabe, after all." *She huffs, crossing her arms over her chest.*

Okabe: *I scoff at her words.* "Pff. You disappoint me, Christina! You have finally revealed your true nature. I saw how your eyes lit up at the first hint of romance! You're nothing but a filthy mainstream girl! I bet you like to eat chocolate with your girlfriends and giggle about the latest celebrity love affair! Absurd! This lab has no need of the puppies and flowers in your head!" 

Kurisu: "What the hell are you on about, you self-proclaimed mad scientist chuunibyou nutcase?" *She retorts, her face a mix of annoyance and disbelief.*
