Okabe: *Suddenly, I trip forward, landing face-first on the floor.* "Mayu--" *I quickly reach out, finding Mayuri's hand.*

Mayuri: "O...kari..." *She whispers weakly.*

Okabe: *Upon hearing her whisper, panic fills me.* "Mayuri! Come on! Get up!" *But there's no response from her, and my heart sinks in despair.*

Kurisu: "Stop! Stop!" *She screams in the background, her voice filled with terror.*

Itaru: "Don't shoot meeeee!" *His terrified scream echoes in the room.*

Okabe: "Guh!" *Suddenly, pain flares at the top of my head. I press down on it, finding my hand soaked with blood.* "Ah, aahhh..." *Struggling with the pain, I manage to crawl towards the Time Leap Machine.*

Attacker A: "Target A, Target C secured." *His voice sends chills down my spine.*

Kurisu: "Run, Okabe! Run!" *She shouts, her voice filled with urgency.*

Okabe: *I manage to activate the Time Leap Machine just as the floor begins to shake.* "Ah!" *Then, everything collapses and reforms. When I open my eyes, everything is back to normal.*

Okabe: "Mayu--" *I stop myself mid-sentence, realizing that she's alive and well.* 

Mayuri: "Okarin? You want a banana too?" *She asks, tilting her head in confusion.*

Okabe: *I shake my head, sinking into the sofa as I try to process everything.*

Okabe: "Kurisu, come with me a second." *I lead her out of the lab, needing her help to figure out what went wrong.*

Kurisu: "What is it? You don't normally say my name normally." *She frowns, confused by my unusual behavior.* "That came out weird."

Okabe: "Please... help me." *I plead, hoping she can provide the assistance I need.*

Kurisu: "...Now this is a shock. I never thought I'd hear those words from you. Do you have a fever?" *She teases, trying to lighten the mood.*

Okabe: "No jokes. I seriously need your help." *I insist, my tone serious.*

Kurisu: "You time leaped, didn't you?" *She asks, her eyes widening in realization.*

Okabe: "How much do you know?" *I ask, hoping she can fill in the blanks.*

Kurisu: "How much do I know about what?" *Her confusion is apparent.*

Okabe: "How about Suzuha being John Titor?" *I bring up the topic, hoping it might trigger her memory.*

Kurisu: "Eh!?" *She stares at me blankly, clearly taken aback by the revelation.*

Okabe: "Have you finished the Time Leap Machine?" *I ask, hoping to get some answers.*

Kurisu: "What are you talking about? I finished it yesterday after an all-nighter, remember? When did you leap from?" *Her confusion deepens, adding to the mystery of the situation.*
