Okabe: *I hear the door open and quickly cover Faris's mouth with my hand, signalling her to stay quiet.*

Viral Attacker A: "Is Faris really hiding in here?" *He asks, his voice echoing in the room.*

Viral Attacker B: "Someone saw two people who looked like them go inside." *He responds, scanning the room for any sign of us.*

Okabe: *My heart sinks hearing this.* "Crap! Someone saw us!? We need to do something. If they call their friends, we're done for."

Okabe: *Suddenly, my phone rings, its tone piercing the silence. I frantically try to silence it.*

Viral Attacker A: "Where are you!?" *He shouts, the ringtone catching his attention.*

Viral Attacker B: "So you were here, Faris." *He growls, his voice filled with triumph.*

Okabe: "Yeah!?" *I retort, trying to buy some time.*

Kurisu: "Okabe! Can you hear me!?" *Her voice comes through the phone in a desperate whisper.* "We called a taxi, but it'll take some time to get there."

Okabe: "You exposed us to the pursuers." *I hiss into the phone, glancing nervously at the approaching men.* "They're right in front of us!"

Viral Attacker A: "Hey, come out!" *He demands, his voice growing impatient.*

Viral Attacker B: "There's no point in hiding!" *He adds, echoing his partner's sentiments.*

Kurisu: "I see. Then I'll lecture you on how to escape. You're in the same the place you were before, right?" *Her voice is steady, her confidence seeping through the phone.*

Okabe: *Despite the danger, I focus on Kurisu's voice, my mind racing as I try to anticipate her plan.*

Kurisu: "Scatter the flour and make a break for it. OK?" *She instructs, her tone leaving no room for arguments.*

Okabe: *My eyebrows furrow in confusion.* "Scatter the flour?"

Kurisu: "Then switch on the light." *She adds, her voice filled with urgency.*
