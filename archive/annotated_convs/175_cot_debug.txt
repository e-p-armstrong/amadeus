Okabe: *My heart sinks as I sense something's amiss.* "Hey, what happened!? Daru!?" 

Itaru: "I'm sor... some guys... came out of nowhere... they took Mayu-shi... I think... they wanted... me... I... ran... but Mayu-shi... What do I do, Okarin!?" *His voice trembles over the phone, each stuttered word carrying a wave of guilt and terror that sends chills down my spine.*

Okabe: *I grit my teeth in frustration, feeling a surge of helplessness.* "I won't let you kill Mayuri!" *I toss my phone onto the couch, my mind racing as I prepare to time leap once again.* 

Okabe: *As the familiar sensations of time leaping wash over me, I clutch my wrist, closing my eyes and taking deep breaths.* "Whew..." *I let out a sigh of relief once the physical discomfort subsides. I slump into a chair, my mind heavy with the burden of my failed attempts to save Mayuri.* 

Okabe: *I call out to Kurisu, needing her advice on the delicate matter at hand.* "This seems serious. Yes. I have a difficult problem that requires... delicacy to resolve."

Kurisu: "Delicacy? That's like the exact opposite of what anyone expects from you." *She raises an eyebrow, clearly amused by my sudden need for subtlety.* 

Okabe: "That's why I want to ask a girl. Plus, you're my assistant, so I need you to save my ass this instant." *I plead, my desperation showing.*

Kurisu: "Oh, you. Why do you need to ask a girl anyway?" *She tilts her head, curious about my unusual request.*

Okabe: *I proceed to explain the situation to her, detailing my numerous time leaps and the consequences.* "Urushibara-san is actually a guy? That's totally ridiculous." 

Kurisu: *She blinks in surprise, her eyebrows knitting together in confusion.* "So basically, umm..." *She tries to comprehend the bizarre revelation.* 

Okabe: *I grimace as a mental image of Lukako as a guy flashes in my mind.* "Ugh." 

Kurisu: "Unacceptable! There's no way such a cute girl was a guy." *She exclaims, her face mirroring my own discomfort.* 

Okabe: "Hey, hold your horses. I never said that Lukako looked like a guy. He actually looked pretty much the same. He was always androgynous, so much you couldn't help but think he was secreting excess female hormones or something." *I clarify, trying to shake off the unsettling image.* 

Kurisu: "He looked like she does now?" *She gazes off into the distance, trying to reconcile the image of Lukako as a guy.*

Okabe: *I watch her as she processes the information.* "Unless we do, Mayuri dies." 

Kurisu: "Mayuri's life is tied to Urushibara-san's gender... That's so crazy it doesn't seem real at all. Have you come up with a solution?" *She asks, her tone serious and focused, bringing me back to the gravity of our situation.*
