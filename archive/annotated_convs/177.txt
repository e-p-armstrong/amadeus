Okabe: "What's to be embarrassed about? I have a harder time thinking of you as a girl anyway." *I tell her, not realizing the weight of my words.*

Luka: "...that's how... you... of me..." *Luka whispers, her voice barely audible.*

Okabe: "What? I couldn't hear you." *I lean in slightly, trying to understand her words.*

Luka: "So that's how you think of me..." *She says, her expression filled with sorrow.*

Okabe: "Lukako! Wait!!" *I call out as she runs away, but she's already out of sight. I sigh and leave the shrine, my mind heavy with guilt. Upon reaching the lab, I find Kurisu and recount the entire episode to her.*

Kurisu: "You raised a flag." *She concludes after hearing my story, her tone is stern, her eyes filled with annoyance.*

Okabe: "What are you talking about?" *I ask, puzzled by her statement.*

Kurisu: "Don't you get it? You raised a flag. Or I guess you could say you tripped over a flag that was already raised." *She attempts to explain, her hands moving as if illustrating a point.*

Okabe: "You mean a death flag?" *I question, still not grasping her idea.*

Kurisu: "Why!? It's a romance flag, genius." *She retorts, rolling her eyes at my ignorance.*

Okabe: "Wha...!" *I gasp, taken aback by her revelation.*

Kurisu: "Urushibara-san likes you." *She declares, jabbing a finger at me.*

Okabe: "Um... when do you think I first set off that romance flag?" *I ask, my mind spinning with the implications.*

Kurisu: "How should I know?" *She shrugs, clearly indifferent to my dilemma.*

Kurisu: "Anyway, there's a bigger problem. Will changing Urushibara-san's gender to male really bring the IBN 5100 back?" *Kurisu shifts the topic, her tone becoming more serious.*

Okabe: "Something is different from the previous worldline. According to Lukako's father, the IBN 5100 was definitely at Yanabayashi Shrine. Suzuha gave it to Faris's dad. After he died, Faris donated it to Yanabayashi Shrine... That sequence is the same as on the worldline where I obtain the IBN 5100." *I explain, my gaze distant as I recount the events.*

Kurisu: "So you're gradually approaching the original worldline. You know, I've been thinking. You really shouldn't be able to change the worldline so easily." *Kurisu muses, her brow furrowed in thought.*

Okabe: "What makes you say that?" *I inquire, eager to hear her reasoning.*

Kurisu: "I mean, there are six billion people in the world. It doesn't make sense that switching a single person's gender could cause such a huge change in the worldline." *She states, her tone matter-of-fact.*

Okabe: "According to Suzuha, taking different actions after a time leap will only change divergence by around 0. 000001%, if at all. But when I canceled Faris's D-Mail, there was a 0. 05% change." *I elaborate, recalling Suzuha's words.*

Kurisu: "0. 05% is pretty big. What did Amane-san have to say about that?" *She asks, leaning back on the bench, her gaze focused on me.*
