Okabe: "There were also some D-Mails that didn't activate Reading Steiner." *I lean back in my chair, my fingers tapping rhythmically on the tabletop.*

Kurisu: "Hmmm. So just cancel the D-Mails that activated Reading Steiner, and the IBN 5100 might come back to you." *She suggests, her gaze thoughtfully fixed on a point in the distance.*

Okabe: *I nod, my mind quickly running through the list of D-Mails we've sent.* "...Kiryu Moeka."

Kurisu: *She raises an eyebrow at me, clearly surprised.* "And Lukako?"

Okabe: "So what should I do about Lukako?" *I ask, my voice laced with concern.*

Kurisu: "Well, you tripped a romance flag, so... Hmm..." *She trails off, her brow furrowed in thought.*

Okabe: *I watch her silently, giving her time to think.*

Kurisu: "...Ah!" *She suddenly exclaims, her cheeks turning a light shade of pink.*

Okabe: *I raise an eyebrow at her sudden blush.* "By the way, Okabe. Is there... someone you like? Wh-why aren't you answering?"

Okabe: "Not really." *I reply, shrugging nonchalantly.*

Kurisu: "Oh... okay." *She murmurs, her eyes dropping to the floor.*

Okabe: "Why do you ask?" *I ask, genuinely curious about her sudden interest in my love life.*

Kurisu: "Ah, no, just wondering! There's no hidden meaning, okay!?" *She quickly denies, her cheeks turning an even deeper shade of red.*

Okabe: "Why are you mad? Also, your face is red." *I point out, a teasing smile playing on my lips.*

Kurisu: "Is not! A-anyway! You should go out with Urushibara-san!" *She blurts out, her face still beet red.*

Okabe: "...Seriously?" *I ask, taken aback by her sudden suggestion.*

Kurisu: "Y-you don't like anyone else, right? Then answer her feelings, you dummy." *She insists, her eyes meeting mine with determination.*

Okabe: "Mayuri dies in two days. I don't have time to play boyfriend." *I retort, my voice harsh.*

Kurisu: "Just go out with her." *She repeats, her expression serious.*

Okabe: "...Seriously?" *I ask again, unable to believe what I'm hearing.*

Kurisu: "If there's nobody you like, then there's no reason not to, is there? Get close and help her work through her feelings. Then she'll probably tell you what you need to know." *She explains, her gaze steady and unyielding.*

Okabe: "Mayuri dies in two days. I don't have time for that touchy-feely stuff." *I reply, my tone final.*

Kurisu: *Her face hardens, her eyes reflecting a mix of determination and regret.* "...Only consider this as a last resort. If you're willing to hurt Urushibara-san, you can always take the information by force. She'll forget after the worldline changes, won't she? In that case, I think it's a valid option. But only when compared to Mayuri's death. ...I hate myself for suggesting this."
