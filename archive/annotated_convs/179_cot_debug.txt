Okabe: "Uh, yeah. So put the Juicy Chicken Number One in the microwave and nuke it so that the D-Mail's basically ABC and..." *I wave my hands in the air, mimicking the process of microwaving.*

Mayuri: "Huwha?" *She tilts her head in confusion, eyebrows furrowed.*

Okabe: "The microwave was developed by knights of the Rosicrucian Order who used alchemy." *I straighten up, a serious look on my face.* "Meaning that the sound of the chime is the brainwashing device, while the chime itself actually doesn't have any meaning at all..."

Mayuri: "Waaah, Okarin's broken!" *She gasps, her eyes wide with surprise.*

Okabe: *I mutter incoherently, my hands busy setting up the Time Leap Machine.* "M-making a tactical retreat."

Mayuri: "Retreat...?" *She echoes, her voice filled with uncertainty.*

Okabe: *I finish my preparations, then turn to find Kurisu fiddling with the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s wiring.* "Genius neuroscientist, I need to talk to you."

Kurisu: "Stop staring. You're distracting me. How many times do I have to tell you?" *She doesn't look up from her work.* "Make it short."

Okabe: "I want you to come with me to Yanabayashi Shrine." *I adjust my lab coat, trying to appear casual.*

Kurisu: "Tell me why. If it's a date or something, then I refuse." *She finally looks up at me, her expression suspicious.*

Okabe: "H-Hououin Kyouma does not go on dates. Much less with his assistant. Ridiculous." *I wave her off, a bit flustered.* "S-so... I need you to explain the differences between the male brain and the female brain."

Kurisu: "What." *She raises an eyebrow, clearly taken aback.*

Luka: "Okabe-san... and Makise-san. Did you come to pray?" *He greets us timidly as we approach the shrine.*

Kurisu: "A-ahem. Actually, we have something to talk to you about, Urushibara-san." *She clears her throat, putting on a professional smile.*

Okabe: *I stand behind Kurisu, watching the conversation unfold silently.*

Luka: "What might that be?" *He asks, his voice barely above a whisper.*

Kurisu: "Did you know? Male and female brains are very different." *She starts, her voice steady and reassuring.*

Luka: "What...?" *He looks at her, his eyes wide with confusion.*

Kurisu: "Male brains are right-dominant. Female brains are left-dominant." *She continues, gesturing to her own head for emphasis.*

Luka: "Y-yeah...?" *He nods slowly, clearly struggling to keep up.*

Kurisu: "Actually, these theories are kinda fringe. They're not really that credible. So if you don't mind, I'd like to do an experiment." *She proposes, her tone becoming more excited.*

Luka: "A-an experiment?" *He takes a step back, clearly frightened.*

Kurisu: "Brainwave mapping. We just take a sample of your brainwaves. Anyway, you'll understand if you try it. Okay? Okay? It won't hurt a bit." *She tries to reassure him, her voice gentle and patient.*
