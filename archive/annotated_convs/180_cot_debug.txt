Okabe: "What kind of perverted old man are you!?" *I cut her off, my voice rising in disbelief.*

Okabe: *I lightly chop Kurisu on the head, my expression stern.* 

Kurisu: "Fwahn! Wh-what!?" *She stumbles slightly, rubbing the spot where I hit her.*

Okabe: "Don't you what me! What did we come here for!?" *I step between her and Lukako, my gaze hard.* "What are you going to do if you scare Lukako away!?"

Kurisu: "I'm just treating her like a valuable test sub--" *She starts to protest, but I cut her off.*

Okabe: "Go back to the lab, you experiment-loving girl!" *I point an accusing finger at her, my voice firm.*

Kurisu: "Yeah, okay. So that's the thanks I get for going out of my way to help you." *She throws her hands up in exasperation.* "I'm gone. You're on your own now." *With that, she turns on her heel and walks away.*
