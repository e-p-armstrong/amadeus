Okabe: *I anxiously check my phone, waiting for the anticipated mail.* 

Luka: "P-please be my boyfriend!" *She stammers, her voice barely above a whisper.*

Okabe: *I quickly turn around, startled by her confession.* "Christina! Christina!" *I start yelling towards the development room, trying to drown out the overwhelming silence.*

Mayuri: "Is Chris-chan sleeping? She worked all night, so you shouldn't wake her up." *She murmurs, giving me a worried glance.*

Okabe: "Christina! Please wake up!" *Ignoring Mayuri's words, I continue calling for Kurisu, my voice desperate.*

Kurisu: "...Oh, shut up." *She emerges from the development room, rubbing her sleepy eyes with a hand.*

Mayuri: "Chris-chan, tutturuâ™ª" *She greets Kurisu cheerfully, trying to lighten the tense atmosphere.*

Okabe: "I'm going to Yanabayashi Shrine. Come with me. It's time for Operation Christina II." *I say, trying to sound as composed as possible.*

Luka: "Until... the 15th... We can stop... before Mayuri-chan is in danger... ...so... Please be my... Please be my b...end... Boy...end... P-please be my boyfriend!" *She repeats her confession, her voice trembling with fear and anticipation.*

Okabe: "E-excuse me. I need a moment." *I turn away from Luka, taking a deep breath to calm my racing heart.*

Kurisu: "Sup, you filthy normal?" *She teases, leaning against the staircase and watching me with an amused expression.*

Okabe: "Who's a normal? Think about how I feel for once. Did you hear what Lukako said just now?" *I retort, my voice shaking.*

Kurisu: "No. Fill me in." *She shrugs nonchalantly, her gaze still focused on me.*

Okabe: "You weren't listening!?" *I exclaim, frustrated by her lack of concern.*

Kurisu: "How am I supposed to listen from all the way over here?" *She points out, raising an eyebrow at me.*

Okabe: "She confessed. Until the 15th. Then back to manhood." *I summarize, my voice barely above a whisper.*

Kurisu: "Roger. And? Why are you asking me? Just grant Urushibara-san's wish." *She suggests, her tone matter-of-fact.*

Okabe: "B-but it's Lukako!" *I stammer, my face turning a deep shade of red.*

Kurisu: "What's wrong with her? I mean, look how cute she is." *She gestures towards Luka, her voice softening slightly.*

Okabe: "But she's a--" *I start, but she cuts me off.*

Kurisu: "Her being a guy might just be your imagination. From my perspective, she's always been a girl." *She says, her voice firm and resolute.*

Okabe: "Gh..." *I wince, struggling to find the right words.*

Kurisu: "Just give up. Bye." *She finishes, turning to leave, leaving me standing there, lost and confused.*
