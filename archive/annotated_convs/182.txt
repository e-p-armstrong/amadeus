Okabe: "What...did you say...?" *I stutter, my mind racing with thoughts.*

Kurisu: *She watches me from the corner of her eye, a smirk playing on her lips.*

Okabe: "Okay, but where?" *I ask, trying to sound nonchalant.*

Luka: "Eh..." *She blushes, twirling her fingers nervously.*

Okabe: *I scratch my head in thought.* "...Then I'll come up with something by tomorrow."

Kurisu: "Well?" *She asks, her tone casual but her eyes sharp.*

Okabe: "Wait, you saw that!?" *I gasp, feeling my cheeks heat up.*

Kurisu: "You told me to watch, didn't you?" *She replies, raising an eyebrow.*

Okabe: "...We're going on a date tomorrow." *I admit, averting my gaze from her.*

Kurisu: "Yeah?" *She makes a small nasal sound, her gaze fixed on the road ahead.*

Okabe: *I quicken my pace, trying to ignore her words.* "Gh..."

Kurisu: *She grabs my shoulder, pulling me back.* "Sorry. I didn't mean to be snippy. I'm just a little irritated." 

Okabe: "What was that for!?" *I exclaim, stumbling backwards.*

Kurisu: *She starts rubbing her temples.* "Anyway, do you have any plans for your date tomorrow?"

Okabe: *I scratch my cheek, feeling slightly uneasy.* "...I have only one thing to say, assistant mine. I am the great Hououin Kyouma, a mad scientist with an IQ rivaling that of Isaac Newton himself!"

Kurisu: "And?" *She retorts, crossing her arms.*

Okabe: "Naturally, as a mad scientist, I have no interest in this thing mortals call love. My incredible brain is devoted to the destruction of the System that controls the world, and the birth of a new age of chaos!" *I declare dramatically, puffing out my chest.*

Kurisu: *She rolls her eyes.* "You're obviously a virgin, thank you ver-- ...Hah!? ...P-pretend you didn't just hear that."

Okabe: "Damn you, assistant! How dare you point out the truth so bluntly! I won't forget this insult!" *I point an accusing finger at her.*

Kurisu: "S-sorry..." *She winces, looking slightly guilty.*

Okabe: "And what about you!? Your experience must be vast indeed if you think you can lecture me about it!" *I retort defiantly.*

Kurisu: "Ugh..." *She grimaces, looking away.*

Okabe: "That's what I thought! You spend all your time on research, so you've got zero experience, don't you!? You must've been awfully lonely in America, huh!?" *I taunt, crossing my arms.*

Kurisu: "Shut up! What's wrong with being a virgin!? ...Hah!? Ah... awhawha..." *She stammers, her cheeks turning a deep shade of red.*
