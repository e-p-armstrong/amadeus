Faris: "Is Mayushii the lucky girl, nya?" *She asks, her eyes sparkling with mischief as she pours milk and syrup into my coffee, right in front of a wide-eyed Kurisu.*

Okabe: "Why would you think that?" *I question, my eyebrows raising in surprise at her insinuation.*

Faris: "Hmmya? Not her, nya? Then..." *She trails off, her gaze shifting to Kurisu, a playful smile tugging at her lips as she stirs Kurisu's iced coffee.*

Faris: "Is it her, nya?" *She asks, her eyes twinkling with amusement.*

Kurisu: "Hwehh...!" *She blurts out, clearly taken aback by the sudden attention.*

Okabe: "No, she's my assistant." *I explain hastily, trying to dispel the sudden tension. I can feel Kurisu's gaze on me, and when our eyes meet, our glares are sharper than a sword's blade. I swear sparks are flying.*

Faris: "Then some other girl, nya? Kyouma, you tomcat, you're making moves on too many girls, nya." *She teases, her laughter filling the small caf√©.*

Kurisu: "Oh-ho... So you're making moves on too many girls, huh?" *She repeats Faris's words, a smirk playing on her lips as she leans back to observe me with newfound interest.*
