Okabe: "Yeah, you're right." *I nod slowly, feeling a rush of relief as I see Luka manage a small smile.* 

Luka: "...Please, save Mayuri-chan. Mayuri-chan is... Really important to me." *Her voice trembles, but she keeps her gaze steady, looking at me with a pleading expression.* 

Okabe: "Lukako..." *I take a step forward, but she raises a hand to stop me.*

Luka: "Ahaha... um, please, go already. If you don't... I might cry... So, please... Thank you... for everything. Ah, this is when I use that phrase, right? Umm, El Psy Kongalee..." *She looks down, her voice barely above a whisper.*

Okabe: "It's Kongroo." *I correct gently, managing a small smile.*

Luka: "El Psy Kongroo." *She bows deeply, her long hair hiding her face. It's clear she doesn't intend to look up until I'm gone.*

Okabe: *I turn away, feeling a heavy weight settle in my chest. I stop in front of the stairs, pulling out my phone with a sigh.*

Kurisu: "Okabe? Mayuri called. She was mad. You stood her up on your promise to go to ComiMa." *Her voice is sharp with worry.*

Okabe: "Christina. I need you to enter a number into the PhoneWave (name subject to change)." *I respond, urgency seeping into my voice.*

Kurisu: "What? Explain yourself." *Her confusion is evident, but there's a note of determination in her voice, ready to do what she can to help.*
