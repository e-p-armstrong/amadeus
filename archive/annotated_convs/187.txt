Kurisu: "You go, Okabe. You're Mayuri's guardian, aren't you?" *She raises an eyebrow in my direction, a teasing smile on her lips.*

Mayuri: "No, Mayushii is Okarin's hostage!" *She chimes in, her innocent eyes glinting with mirth.*

Kurisu: "Oh, right. That's what it was." *She nods, still grinning.* "Well you don't want your hostage to escape, do you? Shouldn't you take her along in handcuffs or something?"

Okabe: "I've got business in Akiba." *I tell them, my eyes focused on my phone, scrolling through the new emails.*

Kurisu: "What do you mean, business?" *She looks at me questioningly, her eyes narrowing slightly.*

Okabe: *I glance at her for a moment.* "The search for Kiryu Moeka," *I mumble, before adding louder,* "No answer? I guess it was just an excuse."

Kurisu: "Christina. We need to talk." *I say, looking straight into her eyes.*

Kurisu: "Again?" *She blinks, surprise evident in her eyes.* "Abrupt as usual."

Okabe: "Hm? What do you mean, again?" *I frown, confusion creeping into my voice.*

Kurisu: "Nothing." *She shrugs, quickly looking away.*

Mayuri: "Whatcha gonna talk about?" *She asks, her eyes wide with curiosity.* "You two have been really close lately, huh? You're always talking together. Mayushii really wants to join in your secret meetings and stuff."

Okabe: "Don't worry." *I assure her with a wave of my hand.* "We've been talking about the Time Leap Machine. It would just be gibberish to you. Besides, the purpose of this particular discussion is to convince Christina to attend ComiMa. Prepare for good news, Mayuri! Muhahaha!"

Mayuri: "Oh, great! Thanks, Okarin." *She claps her hands together, beaming.*

Okabe: *I turn to Kurisu, my expression serious.* "So, Christina."

Kurisu: "I'm not going to ComiMa." *She crosses her arms, a defiant look in her eyes.*

Okabe: "You said 'again' just now." *I narrow my eyes at her.* "We've talked like this before, just the two of us?"

Kurisu: "Losing your memory now?" *She teases, a smirk playing on her lips.* "Does our little mad scientist have an acetylcholine deficiency?"

Okabe: "I'm being serious." *I tell her, my tone firm.*

Kurisu: "You're acting weird today." *She studies me, her eyes narrowing in concern.* "What's going on?"

Okabe: "Please. I need to know." *I insist, my gaze pleading.*

Kurisu: "I mean, yeah. This is like the fifth time you've brought me outside to talk about the Time Leap Machine." *She admits, her eyebrows furrowing in confusion.*

Okabe: "Have we talked about my time leaping?" *I ask, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Kurisu: "You're time leaping?" *She blinks, taken aback.*

Okabe: *I nod.* "More than a dozen times already."

Kurisu: "That many!?" *She exclaims, her eyes wide with shock.* "What the hell are you doing!?"

Okabe: "It's a disgrace to be comforted by my assistant." *I grumble, avoiding her gaze.*

Kurisu: "Why are you always like that!?" *She snaps, frustration evident in her voice.* "I'm even trying to be nice. You're really full of yourself, you know?"

Okabe: "I don't need your sympathy." *I retort, crossing my arms defensively.* "Everything that happened is my fault. I'm just getting what I deserve. ...Come to think of it, every time I explain this to you, I always end up hating myself in the end."

Kurisu: "Okabe..." *She whispers, her voice filled with concern.*
