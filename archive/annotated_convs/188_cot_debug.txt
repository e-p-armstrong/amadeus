Okabe: "There's nothing we can do to prevent her death." *I clench my fists, feeling the weight of our failure.* "Just stay close and tell me when it happens. Once I know, I'll make the time leap."

Kurisu: *"I can't believe there's nothing we can do. It just doesn't feel real." She shakes her head, her eyes filled with disbelief and concern. "But it's the truth, isn't it? I can see it in your eyes. ...Are you okay?"

Okabe: "No. I still haven't saved Mayu--"

Kurisu: *"I know. That's not what I meant." She interrupts me, her gaze intense and probing. 

Okabe: "Are you okay?" *I blink at her, surprised by her question.*

Kurisu: "You're carrying an awful burden." *Her voice is soft, filled with concern.*

Okabe: *"I told you not to worry about me. It's Mayuri you need to worry about." I brush off her concern, my focus returning to Mayuri. "Tomorrow, I'm going to look for Moeka."

Okabe: "I wish there were some way that Mayuri wouldn't have to suffer..." *I mutter, my voice barely a whisper.*

Kurisu: "Then why don't you time leap now?" *She suggests, her voice firm.*

Okabe: "I can't plan effectively without knowing the deadline." *I explain, my voice steady despite my inner turmoil.*

Kurisu: "I don't want to see Mayuri die either, you know." *She murmurs, her voice barely above a whisper.*

Okabe: "I know how you feel, but you're the only one I can ask." *I meet her gaze, my resolve unwavering.*

Kurisu: "Where did all this trust come from?" *She asks, her eyes wide with surprise.*

Okabe: "...You're my assistant, after all." *I manage a weak smile, trying to lighten the mood.*

Kurisu: "You're so full of yourself." *She forces a laugh, shaking her head at my feeble attempt at humor.*
