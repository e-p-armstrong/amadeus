Okabe: *I stare into the distance, my mind racing.* "She's already going to die, so that makes it okay. That the kind of argument a murderer would make."

Kurisu: "Don't be a hypocrite." *She retorts, her gaze sharp.* "We're not talking about right and wrong here, Okabe."

Okabe: *I look at her, my eyes filled with doubt.* "But what about the law? Even if fate forgives me, society won't."

Kurisu: "As long as you have the Time Leap Machine, you can undo anything, even murder." *She says firmly, confident in her words.* "The result will be that you gained the necessary information without killing anybody."

Okabe: "I understand." *I nod, a heavy sigh escaping my lips.*

Kurisu: "...Phew. Just remember one thing. You're responsible for what you do. ...I guess that's quite a thing for me to say, huh? After telling you to kill her." *She looks at me, her expression softening slightly.*

Okabe: "It's fine." *I offer a small smile, appreciating her honesty.* "Your advice was truly becoming of a mad scientist."

Kurisu: "Get it done, Okabe. Bye." *She turns away, leaving me to ponder the weight of our conversation.*
