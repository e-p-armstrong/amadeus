Kurisu: "Definitely." *She nods, her brows furrowed in concentration.*

Okabe: "The worldline didn't change!" *My voice echoes in the lab, frustration clear in my tone.*

Kurisu: "You mean it failed? Why?" *She asks, her hands resting on the table, her eyes never leaving the monitor.*

Okabe: "Maybe the message wasn't enough to persuade Moeka to change models." *I suggest, my fingers tapping nervously on the table.*

Kurisu: "Could we have sent it to the wrong date?" *She tilts her head, her gaze thoughtful.*

Okabe: "It's July 31st. I'm sure of it." *I assert, my eyes meeting hers.*

Kurisu: "Check when the original D-Mail arrived. Maybe her reaction will change if the new one arrives just after that." *She suggests, her gaze never wavering.*

Okabe: "What a pain!" *I groan, running a hand through my hair.* "The pounding on the door has ceased. Did she finally give up? No, she wouldn't give up. Does she plan to climb out the window and loop around? But we're on the second floor. That would be quite a feat. I should still have some time left."

Kurisu: "Try sending different messages. If that doesn't work, I'll adjust the timer." *Her voice is firm, her gaze determined.*

Okabe: "You're a lifesaver." *I sigh in relief, my shoulders slightly relaxing.* "What's going on there? Is Mister Braun freaking out?"

Kurisu: "I can hear him shouting from below. Hashida and Mayuri are trying to calm him down, but who knows how long that'll last. I don't think there's much time left." *She informs me, her gaze shifting to the door worriedly.*

Okabe: *I put my phone into my pocket without hanging up. I change the message and send another D-Mail.* "Are you there?" 

Kurisu: "Still not working?" *She asks, her voice filled with concern.*

Okabe: "I tried two more times, but nothing." *I respond, my gaze focused on Moeka's phone, my mind racing to find a solution.* "I frantically consider my options as I stare hard at Moeka's phone. The walkway is dim, but Moeka's gaudy purple phone shines in the faint light. Wait. I take another good look at the phone. There's something wrong here. What is it?"

Kurisu: "Okabe? What's wrong?" *She asks, her brows furrowed in worry.*

Okabe: "Nothing... changed?" *I mutter, a realization slowly dawning on me.*

Kurisu: "Huh? What hasn't changed?" *She asks, her eyes wide with confusion.*
