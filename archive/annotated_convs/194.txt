Okabe: *I grit my teeth in frustration, my hand gripping the phone tighter.* "...Christina."

Kurisu: "What's that pounding? Are you okay?" *She asks, her voice laced with concern.*

Okabe: "Moeka's D-Mail wasn't about a model exchange." *I mutter, my eyes scanning the screen of the phone.*

Kurisu: "What do you mean!?" *She questions, confusion clear in her voice.*

Okabe: "She must have changed the text right before we sent it. That's why the cancellation mails aren't working." *I explain, my voice strained.*

Kurisu: "Did you check her history? It might still be there." *She suggests, her gaze locked on mine.*

Okabe: "Her arrival history..." *I murmur, a spark of realization crossing my face.* "Of course! Even if it's not in her sent history, it should still be in the arrival history. Now I know exactly where the D-Mail went." *I say, my fingers flying over the phone's keyboard.* "I should have thought of that. Checking now!"

Kurisu: *She watches me intently, her hands clenched in anticipation.*

Okabe: *I let out a frustrated sigh as I scroll through the countless entries in Moeka's mailbox.* "...Christina, I seem to be in a spot of trouble. If I fail, I'm leaving the rest to you."

Kurisu: "Don't be ridiculous! If you're in trouble, then get out of--" *She begins, her voice filled with urgency and worry.*
