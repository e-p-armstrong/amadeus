Okabe: *I look at Moeka, realization dawning on me.* "What was the designated location?" 

Moeka: "The coin locker... in front of Daibiru..." *She mumbles, her voice barely above a whisper.*

Okabe: *I sigh deeply and lift myself off Moeka's body, then lean back against the wall and stretch my aching limbs.* "I'm using your phone."

Moeka: *She slowly gets up, wiping her tears and fixing her hair and clothes. Her lack of reaction to my statement is evident.*

Okabe: *I pull out Moeka's phone and start to search for the D-Mail. After a few minutes, I find it.* 

Kurisu: "Okabe!?" *Her voice comes from the phone, filled with worry.*

Okabe: "You at the lab?" 

Kurisu: "Haah... don't worry me like that... idiot..." *She huffs, her relief evident in her voice.*

Okabe: *I can't help but chuckle at her response.* "What, were you worried about me?"

Kurisu: "I-I mean, you set off an obvious death flag. I'm surprised you're still alive!" *She retorts, her voice tinged with annoyance.*

Okabe: "Where are you now?" 

Kurisu: "I'm standing by at the lab." *She replies promptly.*

Okabe: "Set up the machine. I'm sending another D-Mail." 

Kurisu: "Destination?" *She asks, her voice professional and focused.*

Okabe: "...July 31st, 11 AM." *I reply, my fingers already typing the message on the phone.*

Kurisu: "11 AM on the 31st..." *She repeats, her voice trailing off as she starts to calculate the hours.*

Okabe: *Once the message is ready, I turn to Kurisu.* "Alright, activate it."

Kurisu: "Activated." *She replies promptly.*

Okabe: *I press the send button and brace myself for the incoming vertigo.* "Nothing. Why won't it change!?" 

Kurisu: "Another mistake?" *She asks, her voice filled with concern.*
