Okabe: "So... time for another stakeout." *I announce, after considering Moeka's obsessive emailing and FB's saintly patience.*

Moeka: *She nods in agreement, her eyes glued to her phone as she sends another email to FB.*

Okabe: "It's them!" *I exclaim, squinting at the fuzzy infrared camera feed. I recognize the figures approaching Tennouji's house. They're the Rounders who raided our lab.*

Moeka: *She looks on silently, her expression unreadable.*

Okabe: "What now?" *I ask her, keeping my eyes on the screen as the station wagon drives away.*

Moeka: *She shrugs, seemingly indifferent to the situation.*

Okabe: "Tennouji's wife might be FB." *I conclude, piecing together the evidence.*

Moeka: *She doesn't react, simply staring at me, waiting for my next instruction.*

Okabe: *I sigh, taking out my phone to answer an incoming call. It's Kurisu.*

Kurisu: "I thought I asked you to keep me posted." *She says in a weary voice.*

Okabe: "I've been busy." *I reply, glancing at Moeka who continues her silent vigil.*

Kurisu: "Busy. Right." *She sounds skeptical. She glances at Moeka.*

Okabe: "Were you worried about me?" *I tease, trying to lighten the mood.*

Kurisu: "O-of course not! Why should I care what you're up to? It's just... Mayuri was really worried. I don't want to see her sad. So at least give her a call, okay?" *She stammers, her concern for Mayuri evident.*

Okabe: "I'm doing this to save Mayuri. I'm close to discovering our true enemy." *I say, trying to reassure her.*

Kurisu: "Our enemy? But..." *She glances at Moeka again.*

Okabe: "She is an enemy, but we're cooperating in order to uncover the truth." *I explain, meeting Kurisu's gaze.*

Kurisu: "Isn't she the one who... killed Mayuri?" *She asks, her voice trembling slightly.*

Okabe: "...Yes." *I reply, feeling a pang of guilt.*

Kurisu: "Whatever. So where are you going now? Take me with you." *She says, determined to help.*

Okabe: "Have you gone mad, assistant mine?" *I ask, raising an eyebrow in surprise.*

Kurisu: "I'm perfectly sane, and I'm not your assistant." *She retorts, crossing her arms.*

Okabe: "It could be dangerous." *I warn her, but she simply shrugs.* 

Kurisu: "Eh..." *She insists, ready to face any danger for her friends.*
