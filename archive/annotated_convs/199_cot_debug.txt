Okabe: *I bite down hard on my lip, my fists pounding against the floor in frustration and despair.* "You left your daughter all alone!" *The words echo through the silent room, a harsh reminder of the man's sacrifice and its consequences.* "How could you die with a smile!?"

Okabe: *I slide open the door to Nae's bedroom, my heart pounding in my chest.* "...She's gone?"

Okabe: "...His phone." *I find Tennouji's phone in his pants pocket, my hands shaking as I pick it up. The taste of victory is bitter in my mouth as I rush out of the apartment, pulling the shell-shocked Moeka along with me.*

Kurisu: *She's pacing anxiously when we finally regroup, her relief evident as she spots us.* "...So the manager was FB." *She says quietly, her eyes never leaving the numb Moeka.*

Okabe: *I sit opposite Moeka, my voice gentle as I attempt to offer her some comfort.* "Hey, Moeka... It's possible... that FB did what he did so you could live. Maybe he didn't abandon you. Maybe, by pushing you away, he was trying to keep you safe." *I can't help but wonder if I'm just trying to convince myself as much as her.*

Kurisu: *She interrupts our moment, her voice firm and determined.* "Okabe! We need to send the D-Mail now." *She looks at me, her eyebrows furrowing in concern.* "Miss this chance, and you could be in a lot of trouble." *She takes a step closer, her gaze steady.* "Your goal is to save Mayuri, not take revenge on SERN. Right? ...I don't want anyone else to be hurt because of the machine we built." *Her words serve as a much-needed wake-up call, grounding me back to the reality of our situation.*
