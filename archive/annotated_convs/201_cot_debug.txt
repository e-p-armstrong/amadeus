Okabe: *My breath hitches and my heart freezes in my chest.* 

Nae: "I'll come for you in fifteen years. I hope you spend them quivering in terror. Aha! Ahaha!" *She throws her head back and laughs, the sound chilling to the bone.*

Okabe: *As her laughter fades, I find my voice.* "Wh-what the hell was that? A demon? Was she possessed?" *I can barely keep myself upright, my body trembling uncontrollably.* 

Okabe: "W-what about Moeka!?" *I turn my gaze to Moeka, my eyes wide with terror at the sight of her blood-soaked clothes and the wound in her abdomen.*

Kurisu: "Calm down!" *She snaps, her voice cutting through the deafening silence. She quickly pulls out her phone, her hands shaking slightly.* 

Kurisu: "Check on Kiryu-san! I'll call an ambulance. No, wait! Before that... Maybe you should just send the D-Mail." *Despite her own fear, she manages to think logically, doing her best to handle the situation.*
