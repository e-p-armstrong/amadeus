Moeka: *She sits down on the tatami mats, taking out her phone and typing at lightning speed,* *not questioning why I'm here.* 

Okabe: "What do you mean? Your supervisor? You mean FB?" 

Moeka: *She freezes at my question, her fingers pausing over the phone.*

Tennouji: "Doing your duty sets you up for disposal. So we're more like cattle than dogs." 

Nae: "I won't forgive you, until I kill you with my own hands." 

Okabe: *I shudder at the memory, covering my ears as if to block out the chilling voice.* 

Kurisu: "...Okabe?" *She watches me carefully, a concerned look on her face.*

Okabe: "Wasn't there something strange about that girl?" *I ask, my gaze distant as I replay the unsettling encounter with Nae in my mind.*

Kurisu: "That girl... you mean Nae-chan?" *She questions, her eyebrows furrowing in thought.*

Okabe: *I nod, my mind racing with unanswered questions.* "What did she mean, she'll kill me in fifteen years?" 

Kurisu: "Don't worry about it, Okabe. Send the D-Mail right now. That'll solve everything." *She urges me, her tone firm yet comforting.*

Okabe: "I can't pretend I didn't see that." *I protest, my hand instinctively reaching into my pocket to grab FB's phone.* "I'm time leaping. Back to the lab." 

Kurisu: "Our enemy? But..." *She glances warily at Moeka, then leans in to whisper in my ear.* "Isn't she our enemy?" 

Okabe: "...It's about 7 AM, right?" *I ask abruptly, my mind already considering the implications of my next leap.*

Kurisu: "Huh? Well, yeah, but where did that question come from?" *She blinks in surprise, caught off guard by my sudden change of subject.*
