Okabe: "So you kill Moeka... but what comes next?" *My voice trembles as I confront Nae, my eyes searching hers for any sign of remorse.*

Nae: "Next?" *She shrugs nonchalantly, her eyes devoid of any emotion.*

Okabe: "Are you gonna repeat those fifteen years all over again?" *I press on, desperate to understand her motives.*

Nae: "Hmph. What do I care about those fifteen years? There's nothing for me there..." *She pulls her hand away from my arm, as if my touch disgusts her.* "I don't need anything from you now. Just wait in fear and regret, Okabe Rintaro. Until I come for you in fifteen years." *With a final chilling glare, she turns and runs off.*

Okabe: "Hahaha..." *I let out a dry laugh, the bitter taste of defeat lingering in my mouth.*

Kurisu: "Okabe!" *She rushes up to me, her eyes wide with panic as she takes in the sight of my bleeding arm.* "What happened!? Are you okay!?" *She kneels in front of me, her hands hovering uncertainly over my injury.*

Okabe: "The phone..." *I manage to gasp out, my hand reaching out to her.*

Kurisu: "I brought it, but..." *She hands me the phone, her hands trembling slightly.* "Hey, tell me what happened, will you!? Should I call an ambulance!?"

Okabe: "Calm down... I'm gonna send the D-Mail now." *My fingers move clumsily over the phone's keypad, typing out the message with difficulty.*

Kurisu: "R-right. If the worldline changes, then this wound will go away." *She nods, her gaze still fixed on my arm, as if she can will the wound away.*

Okabe: "Hey... why do you think Tennouji didn't kill Moeka?" *I look up at her, hoping for an answer to the question that's been haunting me.*

Kurisu: "What do you mean?" *She frowns, clearly confused by my question.*
