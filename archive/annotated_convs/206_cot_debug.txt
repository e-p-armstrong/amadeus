Okabe: *I practically slam the lab door open as I walk in, my mind still reeling from my encounters with Moeka and Tennouji.* "Have you been to Kiryu Moeka's apartment?" 

Kurisu: *She looks up from her laptop screen, clearly caught off-guard by my sudden question.* "...Huh? Moeka-san's apartment? Never."

Okabe: "Oh, okay." *I respond curtly, already moving towards the development room.*

Kurisu: "Why do you ask?" *Her brows furrow in confusion as she watches me.*

Okabe: "It doesn't matter. Just wondering." *I dismiss her question, my focus already on the Time Leap Machine.*

Okabe: *I scan the shelves, my heart pounding in anticipation. And then I see it.* "It's here!" *I exclaim, my voice echoing in the room. I rush to a large, familiar cardboard box and open it to reveal the IBN 5100.*

Okabe: "Daru! Daru! Where's my super hacka!?" *I shout, my excitement bubbling over.*

Kurisu: "Uh, he's not here. He went to ComiMa, remember?" *She responds, her voice a mix of surprise and curiosity as she watches me celebrate.*
