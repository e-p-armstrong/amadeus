Okabe: "Mayuri... I'm sorry. It's my fault." *I whisper into the night air, my voice heavy with guilt and sorrow.* 

Mayuri: "Finally... Mayushii was... useful... to Okarin..." *Her weak voice echoes in my mind, her last words before her life slipped away.*

Okabe: *I shake my head, my hands clenching into fists at my sides.* "Wha...t?" *I stammer, the reality of the situation sinking in.*

Okabe: *I feel a lump forming in my throat.* "Mayuri... You can't see the stars from here... How could this happen?" *I mutter, my gaze fixed on the starless sky above.*

Okabe: *I swallow hard, my mind racing with questions and guilt.* "What do you mean, you were finally useful? Tell me, Mayuri..." *I plead to the silent night, my voice breaking.*

Okabe: *I lean back against the wire fence, my legs stretched out in front of me. The cool metal against my back is a stark contrast to the turmoil within me.* "I can't run away. I am the one who twisted fate. I am the one who must decide." *I whisper, my voice barely audible.*

Okabe: *I run a hand through my hair, my mind attempting to piece together the timeline of events.* "That feels so long ago. But now, I can finally explain it. That was the moment I moved to the Alpha worldline." *I murmur, my voice filled with a mix of realization and despair.*

Okabe: *I clench my fists, my nails digging into my palms.* "Who killed her anyway? I still don't know. It definitely wasn't suicide." *I say, my voice filled with frustration and desperation.* "What if I identify the murderer and send them a D-Mail warning them off? Would that prevent her death?"

Okabe: *I let out a sigh, my shoulders slumping as the weight of my predicament settles in.* "I've already seen Mayuri die countless times. Everything I tried to prevent it failed. I understand all too well. When fate wants someone dead, nothing can stop it. I can't save Kurisu." *I whisper, my voice filled with resignation and despair.*

Kurisu: *She suddenly appears, her voice breaking the silence.* "There you are." *She says, her gaze filled with concern and determination.*
