Kurisu: "What are you doing here?" *She looks at me with a questioning gaze, her hands clasped in front of her.*

Okabe: "...Nothing." *I reply curtly, not meeting her eyes.* "How did you know I was here?" 

Kurisu: "You said you wanted to be alone." *She points out, matter-of-factly.* "I ran the numbers and concluded that I had the greatest probability of finding you here." 

Okabe: "Then leave me alone." *I huff, crossing my arms over my chest.* "You don't have to look for me. I'm not a lost little boy." 

Kurisu: "H-hey!" *She stammers, a faint blush coloring her cheeks.* "Is that how you treat someone who's worried about you? N-not that I'm worried about you or anything!" 

Kurisu: *She sighs, her flustered expression morphing into a serious one.* "I was going to leave you alone at first. But you've been acting weird the last couple days. I mean, you're always weird, but more than usual. You look like a kid forced to eat crappy oatmeal. What happened?"

Okabe: "Nothing..." *I mumble the word, my gaze fixed on the floor.*

Kurisu: "Then why did you cancel the cracking of SERN?" *She probes, her eyes never leaving my face.*

Okabe: "You're the one who said we shouldn't." *I shrug, avoiding her intense gaze.*

Kurisu: "Oh, so you're afraid of triggering arrest flags. I get it." *She nods, seeming to understand my hesitation.*

Okabe: "You should praise me for obeying the law for a change." *I retort, a half-hearted smirk playing on my lips.*

Kurisu: "That's not like you at all. What happened to your ego? What happened to the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyo--" *She cuts herself off, her eyebrows furrowed in confusion.*

Okabe: "To hell with my ego!" *I snap, my voice echoing in the silent room.*

Kurisu: "...!" *She flinches at my outburst, her eyes wide with surprise.*

Okabe: "This time, it's not that simple." *I sigh, running a hand through my hair in frustration.*

Okabe: "I have to choose which friend to let die. It would be so much easier if I knew what was right." *I murmur, staring at my hands.*

Kurisu: "...Which friend to let die? What are you talking about?" *She asks, her voice shaky with concern.*

Okabe: "I'm just a student, Christina." *I confess, my voice barely above a whisper.* "You know? The insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma? That's just a fantasy. A character I made up. I bet you had no idea."

Kurisu: "Uh... I may have figured that out when we first met." *She admits, a small, understanding smile on her lips.*

Okabe: "When we first met..." *I trail off, lost in my thoughts.*

Kurisu: "Tell me, Okabe. What do you mean?" *She pleads, her gaze pleading.*

Okabe: "...Do I have to tell you?" *I ask, my voice filled with hesitation.*

Kurisu: "You've never hesitated to ask me for help before. Don't hold back now." *She encourages, her eyes filled with determination.*

Okabe: "...Then prepare yourself." *I warn, my voice heavy with remorse.* "What I'm about to tell you is the absolute truth. And it could also be... your death sentence."

Kurisu: "...eh?" *Her voice cracks, her eyes wide with shock.*

Okabe: "Remember what I told you before? When we delete the D-Mail from SERN's database, we'll reach the Beta worldline, where Mayuri doesn't die." *I explain, my voice steady despite the gravity of the situation.*

Kurisu: "And where SERN doesn't take over the world, right. Everyone lives. Everyone is free. You made it sound perfect." *She finishes, her voice filled with hope and fear simultaneously.*
