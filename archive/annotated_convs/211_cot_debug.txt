Okabe: "Credible?" *I question, arms crossed, my tone dripping with skepticism.*

Kurisu: "It's all secondhand info from John Titor -- from Amane-san, isn't it?" *She retorts, her eyes narrowing in challenge.* "I get that it's the accepted model in 2036. But how exactly did scientists prove the existence of attractor fields?"

Okabe: "Are you trying to say the model may be wrong?" *I stiffen, gripping my lab coat.* "But I know for certain that convergence exists. I've experienced it firsthand."

Kurisu: "Even if they're right about convergence... What about the relationship between worldlines?" *She presses, her voice steady.*

Okabe: "The moment I change worldlines, everything is reconstructed. Past, present, and future." *I argue back, my gaze hard.*

Kurisu: "But that's just from your perspective, Okabe." *She interjects, her tone calm but firm.* "Once you go to the Beta worldline, the 'me' that your brain perceives will die. In other words, your perspective will have chosen the worldline where I die instead of the one where I don't. However... Why can't the world your brain perceives be different from the world my brain perceives?"

Okabe: *I let out a huff of frustration.* "So you're saying worldlines are independent?"

Kurisu: "Like trains, maybe." *She says, leaning back in her chair, her gaze thoughtful.*

Okabe: "Trains?" *I blink in confusion.*

Kurisu: *She fishes out her phone, fingers flying across the screen.* "Um, let me give you an easy example..."

Okabe: "I didn't know you were a railfan." *I retort, trying to lighten the mood.*

Kurisu: "It's just an example. Geez." *She flashes me a quick, annoyed glance before continuing.* "You choose to take the Yamanote Line to Tokyo Station, then transfer to the Tokaido Main Line for the rest of your trip." 

Okabe: "And that applies to the universe? You're claiming the existence of parallel worlds?" *I question, my tone incredulous.*

Kurisu: "...I like to use my imagination too, sometimes. But where's the proof that there's only one world?" *She says, meeting my gaze evenly.*

Okabe: "Suzuha said so... and then there's Reading Steiner." *I answer, my tone firm.*

Kurisu: "In other words, an unknown time traveler and your unexplainable super power." *She counters, her tone dry.*

Okabe: "But we knew Suzuha..." *I object, feeling the sting of her words.*

Kurisu: "There's no way to prove that she was Hashida's daughter, or anything she said about 2036 either. Not without going there ourselves. And if Reading Steiner is what you say, then it means that your subjective experience influences the memories of every single human being. That's completely absurd, Okabe. If it's true, then you're literally a god. But there are no gods in reality. The world doesn't revolve around you. It's just your brain making you believe that it does. If that makes you this world's god, then I must be a god too. My brain is just as big as yours." *She retorts, her voice rising with every word.*

Okabe: "What are you trying to say?" *I ask, feeling my frustration mounting.*

Kurisu: "Let's say you choose the worldline where I die. That doesn't mean I have to do the same. The fact is that I am standing here right now, observing the world with my own subjectivity. I already exist on a worldline where I don't die. Even if your perspective shifts to the Beta worldline, my perspective might remain here. It's a question of where the soul lies. And I won't let you have your way with my soul." *She states, her voice filled with determination.*

Okabe: "No true scientist would accept a hypothesis that flimsy." *I argue, shaking my head.*

Kurisu: "But there's a chance I'm right. So you have nothing to worry about." *She smiles, her expression challenging.*

Okabe: "It's just a hypothesis." *I say, looking away from her confident smile.*

Kurisu: "The same is true of attractor fields. It hasn't been proven. Even if someone did prove it by 2036, that doesn't help us here in the present. In other words... Anything is possible." *She finishes, her smile unwavering.*
