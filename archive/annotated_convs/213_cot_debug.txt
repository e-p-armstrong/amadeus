Okabe: "...Black Tortoise, Vermilion Bird, Blue Dragon, and White Tiger." *I say the words, but my mind is elsewhere, my fingers anxiously tapping on the table.*

Mayuri: "Yeah, that! You know, it was really fun talking to Okarin about stuff like that... But now... Um, Okarin? If Mayushii's a burden... just say so, okay?"

Okabe: "What!? I never...!" *I stand abruptly, my chair scraping against the floor.*

Mayuri: "Ehehe. I'm hanging up now. If you feel like talking to Mayushii about anything, just call okay? Tutturuâ™ª" *Her voice fades, leaving only the dial tone.*

Okabe: "She hung up on me." *I mutter, staring at the phone in disbelief.*

Kurisu: "What did Mayuri say?" *She asks, concern etching lines on her forehead.*

Okabe: *I take a deep breath, gathering my thoughts before responding.* "Aren't you afraid of dying?"

Kurisu: "Did you not hear what I just said?" *She raises an eyebrow, her arms crossed over her chest.*

Okabe: "I heard, but--" *I'm interrupted by the buzz of an incoming email. Rather than continue the argument, I choose to read the message.*

Okabe: "How are you a burden!? Don't say things like that, dammit! Why is she only serious at times like this!?" *I slam my hand on the table, frustration seeping into every word.*

Kurisu: "A burden, huh..." *She murmurs, her gaze distant.*

Okabe: "I've never felt Mayuri was a burden. Not once." *I insist, my voice firm.*

Kurisu: "Then you should tell her that." *She says, meeting my gaze.*

Okabe: *A sigh escapes my lips.* "Maybe it wasn't a good idea to leave Mayuri in the dark. She never looks like she's thinking anything. And yet, she saw my doubt? Either way, I can't tell her the truth."

Kurisu: "Okabe." *She catches my attention, her stern gaze boring into me.*

Kurisu: "The old you wouldn't have worried about anything. Anyway, you should go see Mayuri. I'm sure she has a lot to say." *She advises, her tone softer now.*
