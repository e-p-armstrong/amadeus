Mayuri: *She stands up and turns to the grave once more, leaving a brand new white lily and some dango dumplings as an offering.* "Let's head back, Okarin."

Okabe: "Shouldn't we get some dango for ourselves first?" *I jokingly suggest, trying to keep the mood light.*

Mayuri: "Ehehe! Of courseâ™ª" *She giggles, her mood lifted.*

Okabe: *I guide Mayuri home, my mind a whirlwind of thoughts and worries. The city streets are empty, and the looming storm clouds match my somber mood. Once at home, I decide to head to the roof of Radi-Kan for some solitude.* 

Okabe: *Upon reaching the rooftop, I notice Kurisu lying sprawled out in the middle of the roof.* "...!" *I startle, memories of her prone in a pool of blood flashing through my mind. I rush towards her, but she sits up and turns to face me before I even reach her.*

Kurisu: "...Okabe." *She murmurs, combing her disheveled hair with her fingers.*

Okabe: "You're alive..." *I sigh, shaking my head at my own silly exclamation.*

Kurisu: "Right. I forgot I might run into you here." *She admits, her eyes still focused on the ground.*

Okabe: "What were you doing?" *I ask, trying to ease the tension.*

Kurisu: "...Thinking." *She mutters, her gaze distant.*

Okabe: "Oh..." *I nod, my mind reeling with the implications of her response. The weight of my decision hangs heavy in the air between us. Seeing her so deep in thought only adds to my discomfort.*

Okabe: "Looks like I'm in your way, so I'll just go." *I force a smile, trying to make a graceful exit.*

Kurisu: "...Oh, okay." *She responds, her face still etched with worry.*

Okabe: *Just as I turn to leave, I feel the first drops of rain. I look up, the evening shower already starting to intensify.* "Hey. It's raining." *I call out to Kurisu, who is still standing frozen in her spot.*

Kurisu: "Huh? Oh, yeah." *Her response is absent-minded, her thoughts clearly elsewhere.*
