Kurisu: "It's wet, so it's kinda hard to thread." *She bites her lower lip, focusing on threading the needle through the wet fabric.*

Okabe: "...Did you really just happen to have that on you?" *I scratch my head, genuinely puzzled.*

Kurisu: "Get over it already. Is it really so wrong for me to have a sewing kit?" *She huffs, not breaking her focus from the sewing.*

Okabe: "It's not wrong. It just seems like you planned for this." *I cross my arms, contemplating her readiness.*

Kurisu: "So you're saying I brought it with me because I somehow knew your coat was going to get ripped. Uh-huh. Ridiculous. And before you get the wrong idea, I'm not fixing your coat because I want to or anything, okay?" *She rolls her eyes, clearly unimpressed with my suggestion.*

Okabe: "Nice tsundere line." *I smirk, amused by her defensiveness.*

Kurisu: "Don't mock me. You just happened to tear your clothes, and I just happened to have a sewing kit handy when you did. It's coincidence. That's all." *She snaps, clearly frustrated, but continues to sew.*

Okabe: "Coincidence... Hey... you didn't time leap, did you?" *I furrow my brows, intrigued by the coincidence.*

Kurisu: "So now you're saying that I went back in time for the sole purpose of repairing your stupid lab coat. Uh-huh. Ridiculous. Ridiculous! There. It's so important I said it twice. Comprendes?" *She shakes her head incredulously while tying off a stitch.*

Okabe: "You're right. If you had time leaped, you would've brought a towel, not a sewing kit." *I chuckle at my own joke.*

Kurisu: "What's that, sarcasm? All you do is complain." *She cuts the thread with her teeth and hands me back my coat.* "Here."

Okabe: "Thanks." *I take the coat and briefly inspect the stitches.*

Kurisu: "Um, by the way... it was dark, so I couldn't really see. If it turns out bad, it's not my fault. It was dark. That's all. Oh, and I hope you like the color. Because I have no idea which thread I used." *She speaks hesitantly, looking away.*

Okabe: "It's... random?" *I say, trying to keep the conversation light.*

Kurisu: "Black, red, or pink. Those are the three possibilities." *She shrugs, as if it's not a big deal.*

Okabe: "Let's just hope it's not pink..." *I grin nervously, imagining a pink thread on my lab coat.*

Kurisu: "Achoo!" *She sneezes suddenly, pulling her knees closer to her chest.*

Okabe: "Cold?" *I ask, concerned.*

Kurisu: "I guess." *She shrugs, still hugging her knees.*

Okabe: "Take my coat." *I start to offer my coat to her, holding it out.*

Kurisu: "But it's wet." *She declines, still hugging her knees.*

Okabe: "Well, yeah, but..." *I withdraw my offer, awkwardly folding the coat back.*

Kurisu: "...Have you made your decision yet?" *She whispers, breaking the silence, her eyes focused on the darkness beyond us.*

Okabe: "..." *I hesitate, looking at her. She's hugging her knees to her chest, presumably against the cold. I know what she's asking. But how can I answer?*

Kurisu: "Sigh... You still haven't made up your mind? You like Mayuri, don't you?" *She looks away, seemingly frustrated but also concerned.*

Okabe: "What?" *I'm confused, not expecting her to bring up Mayuri.*

Kurisu: "It's probably just my imagination, but lately, I've been seeing things. Like a strange sort of deja vu. In these visions, you're fighting to save Mayuri all by yourself. You never give up, no matter how much it hurts." *She keeps staring into the darkness, her voice tinged with vulnerability.*

Okabe: "..." *I listen silently. So Kurisu's the same. She still has faint memories from previous worldlines.*

Kurisu: "Then you come to me for help. You're so desperate, so earnest, that I just have to do what I can. N-not that I'm doing it for you, okay!? I just want to save Mayuri, that's all. Anyway, these images are stuck in my head, like memories." *She swallows hard, her voice shaky.*

Okabe: "...Aren't you afraid?" *I ask softly. To save Mayuri, I must undo the current worldline. If I do that, she will die.*

Kurisu: "You know, it kinda feels like we're trapped in an ancient ruin." *She changes the subject suddenly, looking around the dark, empty stairwell.*

Okabe: "..." *I glance at her. What's she getting at?*

Kurisu: "Like the world ended... And we're the only two people left. I've been thinking. Say you go to the Beta worldline, and everyone else goes with you. What if I can't go with you? What if I'm the only one left behind? Would the entire world become like this place? It's just a theory... but I can't help but wonder." *She finishes, her voice tinged with sadness and fear, still hugging her knees.*

Okabe: "..." *I remain silent. The weight of her words sinks in. We both know what's at stake, yet we're still afraid to confront it.*
