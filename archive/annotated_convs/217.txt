Okabe: "I'll save you. Not just Mayuri, but--" I start to speak, resolve in my eyes, but am sharply interrupted.

Kurisu: "Don't make promises you can't keep!" Kurisu interjects, then buries her face in her knees.

Kurisu: "You asked me if I wasn't afraid. ...Of course I'm afraid. Maybe I'll disappear. Maybe I'll be left behind all alone. Or maybe only you will disappear and everything else will stay the same. The world will continue, and nobody will even know that you existed. I'll go back to America as if nothing ever happened. Maybe... maybe... maybe! I feel hopeless, just thinking about all the possibilities. But even so!" She raises her head, spearing me with a piercing glare.

Kurisu: "Do you think I would tell you to let Mayuri die!?" Her words are laced with both emotion and accusation.

Okabe: "Kurisu..." I barely whisper her name, stunned by her passion.

Kurisu: "Jesus, it's cold!" She grabs her own arms, shaking visibly in the darkness.

Kurisu: "It's because of these wet clothes! This sucks. Anyway, enough of this nonsense. It's nothing but conjecture. Baseless. Worthless. I want to cut open my skull and excise the part of my brain that comes up with these delusions." Her tone becomes increasingly bitter and angry, and she starts muttering the last sentence under her breath.

Kurisu: "Listen, Okabe. You can't save both of us. Correct? No matter how you struggle, it's one or the other." Abruptly, she stands up, staring down at me.

Okabe: "But..." I attempt to respond, my words dripping with hesitation.

Kurisu: "No buts. My answer won't change. Save Mayuri." Her voice quivers slightly, revealing a mixture of pain and resolve.

Okabe: "Are you telling me to give up!? To abandon you!? I could never do that!" I look away and clench my fists so hard that my nails dig into the palms of my hands.

Kurisu: "You can, and you must! There's no other way." She remains standing, her gaze unwavering.

Okabe: "No! You're our friend! I won't abandon you!" The tension in the air reaches a breaking point as I shout my refusal.

Kurisu: "Okabe!" In a sudden movement, she drops to her knees and grabs me by the collar, making it difficult for me to breathe.

Kurisu: "Is there another solution? There isn't, is there? I don't want to live if it means sacrificing Mayuri! If you don't save her, I'll never forgive you!" Her eyes meet mine, stern and unyielding, as she practically spits the words at me.

Okabe: "Guh..." I struggle to breathe, crushed by the weight of her words and her grip on my collar.

Okabe: "But you're right here! Why does it have to be this way!?" Suddenly, I pull Kurisu into a tight embrace, unable to bear the distance any longer.

Kurisu: "Okabe..." As I hold her, the tension drains from her back and her hands, and she completely surrenders herself to my embrace.

Kurisu: "Thank you. I know you're hurting for me. But you've done enough. I'm fine, so just think about Mayuri, okay?" Her voice is a soft whisper, and I feel her slowly pull away from the hug, allowing for a momentary, but much-needed, emotional respite.
