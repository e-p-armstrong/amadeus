Roleplay:

Kurisu: *Cheeks reddening, she turns away from me* "Will you... remember me?" *Her voice barely rises above a whisper.*

Okabe: "Of course I'll remember you. Of course I will!" *I step closer to her, locking eyes* "There's no way I could ever forget the girl most important to me!"

Kurisu: "Eh? Y-you mean... Wh-what the hell are you saying!?" *She stumbles back, her eyes widening in disbelief.*

Okabe: "The truth." *I affirm, keeping my gaze steady.*

Kurisu: "B-but... proof. I need proof." *She begins to pace nervously* "I can't come up with a formula otherwise!"

Okabe: *Noticing her flustered state* "When the anterior pituitary gland hypersecretes ACTH, and gamma waves induce stochastic resonance, we can assume an infinite Hausdorff dimension for the Hilbert curve. That is, we can measure the asymptotic line with positron emission tomography...?"

Kurisu: "Kurisu." *I interrupt her scientific rambling, my voice soft but intense. Our eyes meet.*

Okabe: "I love you." *I admit, my heart pounding in my chest.*

Kurisu: *She looks away sharply, her face burning bright red* "...!"

Okabe: "And you?" *I press gently, still holding her gaze when she finally looks back up.*

Kurisu: "Eh!? Wh-what!?" *She stammers, taken aback.*

Okabe: "Do you, uh... How do you feel about me?" *I ask, my voice tinged with vulnerability.*

Kurisu: "Y-you want to know?" *She stops pacing, locks her eyes with mine, and walks straight up to me. Her face is still red but determined. She grabs me by the collar and jerks me towards her.* "Close your eyes!"

Okabe: *Did I make her mad? I lick my trembling lips, trying to ask* "Why close my--"

Kurisu: "Just shut up and close them!" *She snaps, interrupting me.*

Okabe: *I do as I'm told, though puzzled and anxious. I can still feel her grip on my collar.*

Kurisu: "nn..." *Abruptly, I feel her lips against mine, soft and warm. The faint scent of citrus invades my senses.*

Okabe: *Opening my eyes, my mind blank, I find Kurisu's face just millimeters away from mine. I now understand the sensation â€” she had kissed me.* "Wha... wha..."

Kurisu: "I-it's not like I did it... because I wanted to or anything." *She looks down, struggling to find her words.* "It's just... you promised... that you wouldn't forget about me. Research shows that memories are harder to forget when coupled with intense emotions. Y-you're a virgin and a perv, so I was sure you'd have an elaborative rehearsal on your first kiss, instantly making it a long-term memory you'd never forget... so... I just don't want you to forget about me, Okabe. No matter what."

Okabe: *My chest tightens at her frantic excuse, overwhelmed with affection. Fighting to keep my emotions in check, I place my hands on top of hers, which are still clutching my collar.* "S-sorry to disappoint you."

Kurisu: "...eh?" *Her eyes search mine, confused.*

Okabe: "That wasn't my first kiss." *I confess, squeezing her hands gently.*

Kurisu: "W-why you... You're just a cherry boy!" *She huffs, annoyed yet somewhat relieved.*

Okabe: "Shut up, virgin." *I retort playfully, reminiscing about previous kisses on another worldline that never really happened.*

Kurisu: "So it wasn't your first..." *She mutters, looking slightly dejected but also relieved.*
