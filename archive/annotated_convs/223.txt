Okabe: "Got it." *I nod, my eyes locked onto Suzuha's, understanding the gravity of the mission.*

Suzuha: "Then let's go. We'll rendezvous at the time machine when it's over!" *Suzuha gives a quick salute before dashing off.*

Okabe: *I open the hatch and grab the rim, squeezing my way out. Suzuha crawls out after me and closes the hatch behind us.* "You hide! I'll provide a distraction." *I watch as Suzuha draws her gun and fires at the doorknob, shattering the lock. She gives me a quick nod and runs off.*

Okabe: *Feeling my heart racing, I bolt downstairs, avoiding the footsteps of my past self. Once I reach the 4th floor, I stop to catch my breath. I shove Suzuha's watch into my pocket, forcing myself to focus on the mission ahead.* "I have to prevent Kurisu's death. I need to cool off and then head to the 8th floor."

Kurisu: "Excuse me." *I suddenly hear a voice behind me.*

Okabe: "Kurisu...!" *I whirl around, my eyes widening at the sight of her.*

Kurisu: "Um, do I know you?" *She tilts her head slightly, a look of genuine curiosity on her face.*

Okabe: "No..." *My voice is barely above a whisper as I choke back emotions.*

Kurisu: "You came down from the roof just now, didn't you?" *She folds her arms, studying me closely.*

Okabe: *I look into her eyes, those eyes shining with intelligence and strength of will. It's all I can do to not hug her right there. I have to remember, this Kurisu doesn't know me.* 

Kurisu: "I heard a strange sound from the roof. Is that why the building shook just now? What's going on? It's not Doctor Nakabachi's doing, is it?" *Her eyes narrow, and her tone becomes more pressing.*

Okabe: *My silence isn't helping. I clench my fists, struggling to maintain my composure.*

Kurisu: "Are you listening? You're sweating like crazy." *She frowns, obviously concerned but also annoyed at my lack of response.*

Okabe: *I bite my lip, my eyes shifting away from hers. I can't let her know, not yet.*
