Kurisu: *Steps back in surprise and fear, clutching a manila envelope to her chest* "Please answer my question!" *Her eyes pierce through the space between us as she demands an answer.*

Okabe: *I turn around reluctantly, the gravity of my emotions pulling at me.* "Can I--" *My voice trails off, words failing me as I grapple with my inner turmoil.*

Kurisu: *A puzzled frown forms on her face.* "Can you... what?" *Her voice rises, tinged with a blend of curiosity and concern.*

Okabe: *The weight of my indecision suddenly lifts.* "I shake my head," *and before she can react, I seize the opportunity to bolt for the stairs.*

Kurisu: "W-wait! Stop!" *Her voice is tinged with desperation, echoing in the hall as she attempts to catch up to my fleeing form.*
