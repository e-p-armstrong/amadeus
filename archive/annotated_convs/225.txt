Okabe: "..." *My eyes widen, and I slap a hand over my mouth to stifle any sound as the realization hits me.* ...!? Doctor Nakabachi! So Kurisu and Nakabachi do know each other? This doesn't make any sense. Why would she...

Suzuha: "Oh, one more thing. Watch out for Doctor Nakabachi." *Her warning flashes through my mind, unsettling me even more.*

Okabe: *I ponder, my mind racing.* Why is Kurisu even here at a presentation by a man like Nakabachi? Could they be... Wait a minute, it can't be that she is...

Kurisu: "Are you listening, Papa?" *Kurisu speaks up hesitantly, shifting her weight from one foot to the other.*

Okabe: *I feel a shock run through me.* Papa... It's as I feared. He's her estranged father. Could he be the one who... No, I have to keep watching.

Nakabachi: "What is that?" *Nakabachi scowls, tilting his head towards the envelope Kurisu is holding.*

Kurisu: "I heard you were giving a presentation on time travel. So I thought about it too. Could it be possible to make a time machine?" *She holds out the envelope to him, her hands slightly trembling.*

Okabe: *I frown, deep in thought.* Kurisu wrote a paper on time travel? But she hated the idea during her lecture at ATF. Could she be...?

Kurisu: "I'd like your opinion, Papa. We can polish it together, then submit it to the scientific community. I don't know if they'll listen, but just in case, I do have acquaintances at Science Magazine." *She watches her father anxiously as she says this, clearly hopeful.*

Okabe: *I watch Nakabachi closely, noticing his disgusted frown as he flips through the document.* Could this be the Nakabachi Paper that sparked the time travel arms race and ultimately led to World War Three?

Suzuha: "It started with a race between the EU and Russia. Then America got involved, and things really went to hell." *Her words echo ominously in my mind as I watch.*

Nakabachi: "Did I ask you to write this?" *He looks up abruptly, his eyes filled with irritation.*

Kurisu: "Well... no, but... You invited me to come, remember? It was the first time we'd talked in seven years. That's what got me thinking. And as I worked on the thesis, I started to realize it might actually be possible to build a time machine. If the thesis is published, you could have your revenge on the scientific community for shunning you--" *Her words tumble out hurriedly, her eyes searching for some sign of approval.*

Nakabachi: "I wasn't shunned!" *Nakabachi cuts her off, his voice rising in anger.*

Okabe: *I tense up as I see Kurisu shrink back in fear.*

Nakabachi: "Those incompetent bastards were just jealous of my superiority. I was the one who gave up on them!" *He waves the document dismissively as he speaks.*

Kurisu: "Please don't yell..." *Kurisu's voice is low, and she looks away, hurt and disappointed.*

Okabe: *I watch as Nakabachi gives his daughter a disdainful snort, then goes back to flipping through the paper.*

Kurisu: "You read really fast, Papa. Just like I remember." *She says softly, still hoping for a sliver of reconciliation.*
