Roleplay:

Okabe: *My eyes dart between Kurisu's pained face and my own trembling hands. I'm paralyzed, struggling to reconcile my inability to act. Kurisu's body spasms against me, her agony evident.* Why won't my hands move? I want to pull out the knife. I want to ease her pain. Why won't my body obey me!? It's as if someone else is in control. "Why..." *I whisper, my voice heavy with regret.*


Kurisu: "Because... he's still... my father." *Her voice is shaky, each word punctuated by labored breaths. Her eyes momentarily drift toward her father before refocusing on me.* "I just... wanted him... to accept me... I studied... so hard... hoping he would... praise me..." *Her hand weakly clutches at her side where the knife is.* "But now... I finally... understand... Papa... didn't want... to accept me... I'm such... an idiot... Why... did I save him... I wonder..." *Her eyes seem to glaze over, as if looking into a distant past.* "I'm... sorry... for getting you... involved..." *She grimaces, clearly struggling to stay conscious.* "Ugh... it hurts... Am I... going to die? I don't want to die... I don't want it... to end... like this..."

Okabe: *My gaze shifts to her father for a moment, who seems to be wallowing in a mixture of regret and disbelief. Then I look back at Kurisu, her eyes dimming.* Don't die. Please don't die on me! But my prayers are in vain.

Kurisu: "Help... me... He...lp..." *Her voice barely rises above a whisper now, her hand feebly reaching towards me as her eyes begin to close.*
