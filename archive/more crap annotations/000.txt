Mayuri: *I tilt my head in a puzzled manner, my brows furrowing slightly as I try to figure out what Okabe is mumbling about.* "Hey, what are you mumbling about?"

Okabe: *I feel the heat of the summer sun on my skin, the sweat trickling down my chin, and the silence in my ear from the other end of the phone. It's like a scene straight out of a spy movie.* 

Mayuri: *I wave my hand in front of Okabe's face, trying to get his attention.* "Okarin? Earth to Okarin!"

Okabe: *I glance at Mayuri, whose innocent and childlike features are void of any tension, despite the imminent danger we are about to face. I put a finger to my lips, signaling her to be quiet.*

Mayuri: *I look at Okabe with wide eyes, my curiosity piqued.* "You talking to someone?"

Okabe: *I nod in response and press the phone back to my ear, checking for any sound. Still silence. They must be maintaining it for safety. The place could be bugged.*

Okabe: *I clear my throat, my voice steady as I get back into character.* "...No, I was just talking to someone. Everything's fine. I'm about to infiltrate the assembly hall."

Okabe: *There's still no reply. They just want my report. It's too dangerous to waste time talking here anyway.*

Okabe: *I try to keep my tone steady, pushing down the panic that threatens to bubble up.* "Yeah, Doctor Nakabachi got the jump on us, but I'll make sure he tells us everything. What!? The Organization is already on the move!?"

Okabe: *I feign shock, widening my eyes dramatically. Mayuri turns towards me in surprise. I let out a sigh, shaking my head as I massage my temples.*

Okabe: *With a heavy sigh, I utter the parting words with a tone of finality.* "I see... so that's the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo."

Okabe: *I pocket my cellphone and start moving towards Radi-Kan, bypassing the elevators and escalators, heading straight to the 8th floor via the stairwell. I only make it to the 7th floor before exhaustion hits me, forcing me to stop and rest.*

Mayuri: *I follow Okabe, not even short of breath as we reach the 7th floor.* "Who was that on the phone?"

Okabe: *Gasping for air, I turn to Mayuri, wiping the sweat off my brow.* "If I told you, I'd have to kill you."

Mayuri: *I giggle, taking his dramatic reply in stride.* "Oh, wow. Thanks, Okarin!"
