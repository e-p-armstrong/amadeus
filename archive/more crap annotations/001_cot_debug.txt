Okabe: *I sigh, running a hand through my hair in exasperation.* "How many times do I have to tell you, Mayuri? Don't call me Okarin."

Mayuri: *She tilts her head, her brows furrowing in confusion.* "Huh? But I've always called you that."

Okabe: *I puff up my chest, a manic glint in my eyes.* "That was then! I have since become Hououin Kyouma, the insane mad scientist hunted by secret organizations the world over. Muhahaha!"

Mayuri: *She giggles, shaking her head.* "But that's too hard to remember."

Okabe: *I nod solemnly, my gaze distant.* "In any case, Hououin Kyouma is my true name."

Mayuri: *She bursts into laughter, clutching her stomach.* "And besides, it doesn't even sound like Okabe Rintaro. You're weird, ehehe!"

Okabe: *I scowl, crossing my arms over my chest.* "Cease your foolish laughter! Okabe Rintaro may be my real name, but I have rejected it, for it is stupid. And so I also hate the derivative Okarin. Come on, it sounds like that elf boy's blue pipe thing."

Mayuri: *She wipes a tear from her eye, still chuckling.* "So, Okarin, can I ask you something?"

Okabe: *I groan, massaging my temples.* "In one ear and out the other. She's been calling me that for five years now, so maybe it's time to give up."

Mayuri: *She blinks up at me, her eyes wide and innocent.* "What are we doing here?"

Okabe: *I gape at her, incredulous.* "Wait. You followed me here without knowing why?"

Mayuri: *She nods enthusiastically, her smile never wavering.* "Yup."

Okabe: *I pinch the bridge of my nose, trying to stifle a sigh.* "We're here for Doctor Nakabachi's press conference."

Okabe: *I glance around the assembly hall on the 8th floor of Radi-Kan, where the conference is to be held. Doctor Nakabachi, an inventor who occasionally appears on TV and has a few patents to his name, is mostly treated as a curiosity. Yet, his claim of having invented a time machine piqued my interest.*

Mayuri: *She looks around, her brow furrowed in confusion.* "Press conference? But where are the reporters?"

Okabe: *I scan the hall, my heart sinking as I realize she's right. There's no one who looks like a reputable reporter or cameraman. Just a handful of us, no more than ten, standing in the hall. Considering Nakabachi's media presence and his claims, I'd have expected more.* "Could this be the Organization working its twisted influence?"

Okabe: *I sneer, my mind racing with possibilities. I thought Nakabachi was like me, a scientist fighting against the Organization. But this... this suggests other motives.* "I'd prefer not to get wrapped up in his mess."

Okabe: *Despite my words, I can't help but be interested in what he has to say. It's why I'm here, wasting an afternoon of my precious summer holiday.* 

Mayuri: *She tilts her head, considering my words.* "You wrapped something? Is it his birthday too? Ehehe!"

Okabe: *I let out a sigh, shaking my head at her bad joke. Mayuri's always been... special.* "Keep your guard up, Mayuri. I suspect this won't be a normal conference--"
