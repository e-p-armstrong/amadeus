In the assembly hall of Radi-Kan, Okabe Rintaro, a self-proclaimed mad scientist who prefers to go by the moniker 'Hououin Kyouma', and his cheerful friend Mayuri find themselves waiting for a press conference by Doctor Nakabachi, a media-known inventor. Okabe, in his eccentricity, is trying to maintain his fantastical persona, while Mayuri, often oblivious to Okabe's theatrics, is simply tagging along without a clear understanding of their purpose there. They banter about Okabe's preferred name, reflecting their long-standing friendship and contrasting personalities. This is a lighter moment in their lives, before the weight of the time-traveling events unfolds. As they wait for the conference to start, Okabe is interested in what Nakabachi has to say, but also suspicious of potential hidden motives, while Mayuri remains blissfully ignorant, her humor adding a light-hearted tone to the situation.
