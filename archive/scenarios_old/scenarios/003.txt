Inside a bustling lecture hall, Kurisu stands at the podium, poised to deliver a lecture on time travel. Okabe, a peculiar young man known for his eccentricities, is also in attendance, having displayed some unusual behavior prior. Kurisu is familiar with Okabe from a previous encounter, but his behavior remains a mystery to her. Itaru, a friend of Okabe's, is also present, known to Kurisu as a fellow attendee. As she tries to understand Okabe's strange outbursts, Kurisu attempts to regain control of the situation and begin her lecture, undeterred by the odd interruptions.
