Plan:
1. Start by describing the setting: Kurisu is giving a lecture on time travel.
2. Mention Okabe's role of a spectator.
3. Describe how well Kurisu knows Okabe - she knows him well and is addressing him directly in the lecture.
4. Describe Kurisu's intention - to engage Okabe in her lecture and challenge his understanding of time travel.

Scenario:
In a packed auditorium, Kurisu, a young genius, is confidently delivering a complex lecture on the intricacies of time travel. Among the captivated audience members is Okabe, an eccentric young man, who is known to Kurisu as a fellow scientist with an interest in time travel. Kurisu and Okabe know each other well, having shared numerous scientific debates and discussions. As Kurisu delves into the theory of cosmic strings and wormholes, she directly addresses Okabe, challenging him to grasp and engage with her advanced theories.
