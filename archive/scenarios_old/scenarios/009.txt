Kurisu finds herself in a laboratory with Okabe and Itaru, two individuals she has recently met. Okabe and Itaru have been working experiments related to an odd microwave device, and their somewhat unorthodox research methods have caught Kurisu's attention. Despite her initial impressions of them as somewhat eccentric, she is intrigued by their work and wants to understand it better. Kurisu is trying to negotiate her involvement in their research, setting boundaries to ensure a respectful and professional environment.
