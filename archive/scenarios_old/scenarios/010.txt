Kurisu finds herself in a makeshift laboratory with Okabe, an eccentric self-proclaimed mad scientist, and his assistant, Itaru. They are engaged in a lively discussion about a peculiar experiment involving bananas and a modified microwave. Despite the ongoing banter and playful name-calling, Kurisu knows Okabe and Itaru well enough to understand their unconventional methods. She is skeptical yet intrigued by their claims, and is trying to make sense of the experiment's results. To confirm her understanding, she decides to rerun the experiment herself, hoping for a breakthrough.
