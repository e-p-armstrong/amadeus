Kurisu finds herself in an experimental lab session along with Okabe and their mutual friend, Itaru. They are working together on a project and have just witnessed an inexplicable event: a banana appears to have teleported. Kurisu knows Okabe and Itaru well as they are all part of the same experimental group and have been working together on this project for a while. In an attempt to make sense of what they've just observed, Kurisu is trying to gather as much information as she can, interrogating Okabe and Itaru about their previous experiments.
