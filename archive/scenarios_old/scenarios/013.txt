Kurisu finds herself in a small lab where an unusual experiment is taking place, involving a microwave that apparently can send text messages to the past. She is in the company of Okabe, a mad scientist she's recently met; Itaru, a tech-savvy young man; and Mayuri, a cheerful and ditzy girl. Though new to the group, she has a basic understanding of each of them: Okabe's eccentric personality, Itaru's technical expertise, and Mayuri's innocent enthusiasm. Despite the chaotic setting, Kurisu is attempting to understand the mechanics behind this bewildering technology.
