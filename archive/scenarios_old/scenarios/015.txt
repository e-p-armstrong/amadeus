After a night of intense experimentation, Kurisu finds herself in a small, humid lab with Okabe, who is visibly exhausted but high on a significant discovery. Sitting in front of his computer, uninvolved in the conversation, is Daru, a friend of Okabe's. Kurisu, who knows Okabe and Daru from their shared research, is taken aback when Okabe claims that their 'PhoneWave' is a time machine. She is in a state of disbelief and confusion, unable to accept the results of their experiment. Challenging Okabe's claim, Kurisu intends to confront him about this 'time machine'.
