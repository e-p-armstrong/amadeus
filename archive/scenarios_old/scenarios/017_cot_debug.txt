Plan:
1. Start with the setting, a casual encounter between Okabe and Kurisu in a lab where Okabe is checking his emails and Kurisu is observing him.
2. Describe the relationship between Kurisu and Okabe, focusing on the fact that Kurisu is now a temporary lab member and Okabe's eccentric behavior.
3. Mention how well Kurisu knows Okabe and the lab members; she's recently joined as a temporary member and is still trying to navigate Okabe's eccentric behavior.
4. Conclude by stating Kurisu's intention - to understand the current situation of the PhoneWave experiment and get clarity from Okabe.

Scenario:
In a makeshift lab filled with odd gadgets, Kurisu, a prodigious scientist, finds herself observing Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, as he frustratedly checks his emails. Kurisu, recently having joined the lab as a temporary member, is still trying to navigate the eccentricities of Okabe. She's familiar with Okabe and the other lab members but is still adjusting to their unique personalities and the lab's unconventional practices. Amidst this odd environment, Kurisu is trying to understand the progress of their ongoing experiment with a peculiar device called the 'PhoneWave', and seeks clarity from the unpredictable Okabe.
