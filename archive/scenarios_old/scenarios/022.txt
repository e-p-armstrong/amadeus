Kurisu finds herself at a shrine with Okabe, a fellow scientist and friend, and Luka, a shrine maiden she's meeting for the first time. Okabe, known for his eccentricities, introduces Kurisu as his assistant, a title she disputes, leading to their usual banter. Despite this playful argument, Kurisu insists on a proper introduction to Luka, wanting to establish a clear and accurate first impression. She tries to correct Okabe's misleading statements about their identities, striving to maintain a sense of normalcy amidst his theatrics.
