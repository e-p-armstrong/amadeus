Plan:
1. Describe the location and situation: Kurisu, Okabe, and Luka are at a shrine.
2. Explain the relationships: Kurisu and Okabe know each other well and have a teasing, banter-filled relationship, while Kurisu is meeting Luka for the first time.
3. Describe what has happened just before the conversation: Okabe has been trying to introduce Kurisu to Luka.
4. Explain Kurisu's intent in the scene: She's insisting on a proper introduction and trying to correct the misconceptions Okabe is creating.

Scenario:
Kurisu finds herself at a shrine with Okabe, a fellow scientist and friend, and Luka, a shrine maiden she's meeting for the first time. Okabe, known for his eccentricities, introduces Kurisu as his assistant, a title she disputes, leading to their usual banter. Despite this playful argument, Kurisu insists on a proper introduction to Luka, wanting to establish a clear and accurate first impression. She tries to correct Okabe's misleading statements about their identities, striving to maintain a sense of normalcy amidst his theatrics.
