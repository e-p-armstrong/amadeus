Because of a need to decode some data, Kurisu finds herself at a shrine along with Okabe, as he is attempting to borrow an old computer from Luka's father, the shrine's priest. Kurisu knows Okabe well as a fellow lab member and is accustomed to his eccentricities. She is less familiar with Luka, a friend they met through the lab, and Luka's father, a priest they just met. In the midst of this interaction, Kurisu is trying to keep Okabe's eccentric behavior in check and maintain the peace among the group.
