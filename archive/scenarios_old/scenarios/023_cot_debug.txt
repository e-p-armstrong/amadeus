Plan:

1. Start by setting the location and the situation - Okabe borrowing an old computer from Luka's father, at a shrine.
2. Briefly describe the relationship between Kurisu and the other characters present: Okabe (her fellow lab member), Luka (a friend they know through the lab), and Luka's father (a priest they just met).
3. Describe Kurisu's current state, slightly bemused by Okabe's eccentric behavior, and her general disposition towards him.
4. Conclude by stating Kurisu's intention - to keep the peace between Okabe and Luka, and to clarify a misunderstanding.

Scenario:
Because of a need to decode some data, Kurisu finds herself at a shrine along with Okabe, as he is attempting to borrow an old computer from Luka's father, the shrine's priest. Kurisu knows Okabe well as a fellow lab member and is accustomed to his eccentricities. She is less familiar with Luka, a friend they met through the lab, and Luka's father, a priest they just met. In the midst of this interaction, Kurisu is trying to keep Okabe's eccentric behavior in check and maintain the peace among the group.
