Plan:
1. Begin with the context of the scene: Okabe is in need of assistance to transport a heavy object, so he's calling for help.
2. Highlight Kurisu's location at the time, which is the lab's second floor.
3. Mention the relationship between Kurisu and the other characters present in the scene: Okabe and Luka. Specifically, that Kurisu is familiar with both of them.
4. Conclude by stating Kurisu's intention, which is to confront Okabe about his lack of communication.

Scenario:
Okabe and Luka, a timid young man he's familiar with, are at the base of a precarious building, in need of help to move a heavy object upstairs. Kurisu, who knows both Okabe and Luka, is waiting in the lab on the second floor. After Okabe calls out for assistance, Kurisu, irritated by his antics and his failure to answer his phone, decides to confront him about his lack of communication.
