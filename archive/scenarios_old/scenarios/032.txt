After a series of unexplained events involving a modified microwave (the PhoneWave), Kurisu finds herself in a laboratory with Okabe, a fellow lab member, and Mayuri who is not directly involved. She knows Okabe to be an eccentric yet intelligent individual, and Mayuri, a sweet-natured girl who has a habit of claiming food items as her own. In an attempt to unravel the mystery behind these events, Kurisu engages in an experiment with Okabe, testing various objects in the PhoneWave. She is skeptical of Okabe's claims of time travel and aims to disprove them through scientific reasoning and experimentation.
