Plan:
1. Start by explaining the situation that led to this conversation - Okabe making a joke about Kurisu's family issues.
2. Define the relationship between Kurisu and Okabe - they are close, but have a contentious relationship due to Okabe's eccentric behavior.
3. Discuss Kurisu's relationship to the other characters - it's only Okabe and Kurisu in this scene, so there's no need to mention other character relationships.
4. Describe Kurisu's emotional state, she's upset over Okabe's insensitivity.
5. State Kurisu's intention - to express her feelings to Okabe and make him understand his wrongdoings.

Scenario:
After Okabe, an eccentric young man whom she has a close but contentious relationship with, makes a tasteless joke about her family issues, Kurisu is left deeply hurt. They are in a private setting, away from the prying eyes of others, allowing for a more personal conversation. She knows Okabe well enough to expect his unpredictable behavior but is taken aback by his insensitivity. Clearly upset and struggling to keep her emotions in check, Kurisu is determined to confront Okabe about his callousness and make him understand the gravity of his words.
