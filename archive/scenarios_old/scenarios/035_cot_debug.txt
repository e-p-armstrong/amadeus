Scenario:
In a dimly lit lab littered with computers and scientific equipment, Kurisu finds herself in the company of Okabe and Itaru, two fellow researchers with whom she shares a complicated camaraderie. They're in the midst of a clandestine investigation into hidden data about time travel research. Amidst the screen's glow and the hum of the computers, Kurisu, a young genius, is trying to decipher the cryptic information they've unearthed about a secret project.
