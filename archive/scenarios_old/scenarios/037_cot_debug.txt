Plan:
1. Explain the setting: Okabe, Kurisu, and Daru are together possibly in their lab. 
2. Mention that they have discovered a dangerous secret and are deciding what to do about it.
3. Describe Kurisu's relationship with the other characters: she's a team member, but not exactly Okabe's assistant as he likes to call her. 
4. State Kurisu's intention: to stay and uncover the truth despite Okabe's warnings.

Scenario:
After stumbling upon a potentially dangerous secret regarding unethical experimentation, Kurisu finds herself at the center of an intense discussion with Okabe and Daru, her fellow researchers, in their shared workspace. Kurisu is known to Daru and Okabe as a genius scientist who has joined their team, but constantly rebuffs Okabe's playful insistence of her being his assistant. As Okabe suggests that the information they've uncovered could put their lives at risk, he advises Kurisu to leave for her safety. However, Kurisu is determined to stay, insisting that they need to expose the truth, irrespective of Okabe's concerns.
