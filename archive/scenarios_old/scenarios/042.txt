In a small, cluttered lab filled with a mix of second-hand equipment and high-tech devices, Kurisu, Okabe, and Itaru are engrossed in an intense discussion about their ongoing project involving time and space travel. Okabe and Itaru are Kurisu's colleagues who, despite not being as well-versed in the complexities of the subject, genuinely share the same passion. The trio faces an uphill battle against a well-funded organization, and they are trying to figure out how they can outsmart them. At this point, Kurisu is breaking down the complexities of time and space travel to Okabe and Itaru, explaining why their task is not as simple as they might think. Kurisu's aim is to make Okabe understand the massive challenge they face, hoping to inspire new ways to overcome the obstacles in their path.
