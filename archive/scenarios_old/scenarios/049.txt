After a series of unusual experiments in their makeshift laboratory, Kurisu, Okabe, and their colleagues Mayuri and Itaru are trying to piece together their findings. As a group of young, scientific-minded friends, they've been pushing the boundaries of what they understand about time and space. They're in the middle of a heated discussion about the curious results of their latest experiment, a device that seems to have time-altering capabilities. Kurisu, the group's resident genius, is attempting to explain their observations and establish a concrete set of rules for the device's operation.
