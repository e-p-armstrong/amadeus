Plan:
1. Describe the setting: they are in their lab, conducting experiments and discussing the results.
2. Mention the other characters: Okabe, Mayuri, and Itaru, and Kurisu's relationship with them (they are her colleagues).
3. Describe the context: they have been experimenting with a device (don't use the term D-Mail or PhoneWave) that seems to have time-altering capabilities. 
4. State Kurisu's goal: She's trying to make sense of the results and establish rules for how the device operates.

Scenario:
After a series of unusual experiments in their makeshift laboratory, Kurisu, Okabe, and their colleagues Mayuri and Itaru are trying to piece together their findings. As a group of young, scientific-minded friends, they've been pushing the boundaries of what they understand about time and space. They're in the middle of a heated discussion about the curious results of their latest experiment, a device that seems to have time-altering capabilities. Kurisu, the group's resident genius, is attempting to explain their observations and establish a concrete set of rules for the device's operation.
