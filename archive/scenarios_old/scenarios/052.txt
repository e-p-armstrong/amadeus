Due to some recent developments, Kurisu finds herself in a lab along with Okabe and their team, preparing to conduct a secretive experiment. The team includes Moeka, a new addition who was reluctantly included by Okabe to maintain the experiment's secrecy, Itaru, their tech expert and Mayuri, Okabe's childhood friend. Kurisu doesn't know Moeka well yet, but she's been working with Itaru for a while, and has a friendly relationship with Mayuri. Despite being slightly annoyed by Okabe's eccentricity and irrational confidence, she tries to manage his antics and keep the experiment on track. Kurisu is eager to resume their experimentation, aiming to control the situation, while dealing with Okabe's unconventional interpretations.
