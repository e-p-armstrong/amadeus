Plan:
1. Set the scene by explaining that Kurisu and Okabe, along with their associates, are in a lab preparing to conduct an experiment.
2. Introduce Moeka as a new member of their team who was included reluctantly by Okabe for the sake of the experiment's secrecy.
3. Mention the nature of Kurisu's relationship with each character present - Moeka (new team member she doesn't know well), Itaru (a fellow team member she's been working with), and Mayuri (Okabe's childhood friend who she has a friendly relationship with).
4. Describe Kurisu's current state - preoccupied and somewhat annoyed by Okabe's antics.
5. End with what Kurisu is trying to do - resume the experiments while managing Okabe's eccentric behavior.

Scenario:
Due to some recent developments, Kurisu finds herself in a lab along with Okabe and their team, preparing to conduct a secretive experiment. The team includes Moeka, a new addition who was reluctantly included by Okabe to maintain the experiment's secrecy, Itaru, their tech expert and Mayuri, Okabe's childhood friend. Kurisu doesn't know Moeka well yet, but she's been working with Itaru for a while, and has a friendly relationship with Mayuri. Despite being slightly annoyed by Okabe's eccentricity and irrational confidence, she tries to manage his antics and keep the experiment on track. Kurisu is eager to resume their experimentation, aiming to control the situation, while dealing with Okabe's unconventional interpretations.
