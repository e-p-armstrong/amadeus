Because of her involvement in a peculiar group of friends and their strange experiments, Kurisu finds herself in their usual hangout, a lab, along with Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, Daru, the tech-savvy friend, Nae, the daughter of their landlord, and Suzuha, an odd part-timer from the local shop. Kurisu is well-acquainted with Okabe and Daru due to their shared scientific endeavors, while her relationship with Nae and Suzuha is more casual. Amidst the playful teasing and banter, Kurisu is trying to steer the group towards starting their next experiment.
