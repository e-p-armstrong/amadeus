Plan:

1. Describe the setting which includes Okabe and his friends gathered for an experiment involving the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
2. Briefly introduce each character present in the scene and their relationship with Kurisu.
3. Describe Kurisu's state of mind, i.e., her concern and apprehension about the experiment.
4. Set up Kurisu's intended actions, which is to voice her concerns and argue against the reckless experiment.

Scenario:

Because of a daring experiment concerning time manipulation, Kurisu finds herself in a lab along with Okabe, Itaru, Mayuri, and Moeka. Okabe is an eccentric young man she often argues with, Itaru is a tech-savvy friend of Okabe's, Mayuri is a gentle, kind-hearted girl who's close to Okabe, and Moeka is a shy woman who rarely speaks. Kurisu knows Okabe and Itaru quite well since they work together in the lab, while she's less familiar with Mayuri and Moeka. As the group discusses the potential risks of their experiment, Kurisu is trying to persuade them, particularly Okabe, not to go through with it due to the grave dangers involved.
