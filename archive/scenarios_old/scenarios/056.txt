Kurisu finds herself in the midst of a heated debate, surrounded by a group of friends-turned-colleagues in their makeshift laboratory. Among the group are Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist with eccentric ideas, Mayuri, a sweet and naive girl who is Okabe's childhood friend, Itaru, a tech-obsessed otaku, and Moeka, a quiet and seemingly detached woman. Kurisu knows them all quite well, having spent a significant amount of time working with them on their time-altering device. The group is currently engaged in a discussion about using their device to win the lottery, an idea proposed by Okabe. Kurisu, skeptical of Okabe's intentions and concerned about the ethical implications, attempts to steer the conversation towards a more responsible use of their invention.
