The device they're working with is a peculiar one, capable of sending text messages back in time. Kurisu is familiar with her companions: Itaru, a tech-savvy friend and collaborator, and Moeka, a seemingly disinterested observer who Okabe seems to know. Determined to make the experiment work, Kurisu is focused on calculating the precise time frame for the message, ensuring it arrives at the correct point in the past.
