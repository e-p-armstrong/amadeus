In a tense moment in a quiet room, Okabe, Kurisu, Luka, and Mayuri are together. Kurisu, an intelligent and analytical woman, knows Luka, a shy and timid young man, and Mayuri, a cheerful and kind-hearted girl, well from previous interactions. The atmosphere grows tense when Okabe forcefully questions Luka about a lottery ticket that matches numbers from his D-Mail, a message sent to the past. Observing Okabe's unusual behavior, Kurisu feels confused and concerned, prompting her to question Okabe's actions, trying to understand the situation better.
