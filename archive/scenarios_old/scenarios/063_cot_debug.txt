Plan:

1. Start by explaining the background event - an experiment involving the PhoneWave, a device the group has been testing. 
2. Describe the location of the event - their lab, where they have been working on the PhoneWave.
3. Discuss Kurisu's relation to Okabe and the other characters present in the lab - she's a new member, but she's been working closely with them for a while.
4. Conclude with Kurisu's action - she's trying to confirm Okabe's actions with the PhoneWave.

Scenario:
Kurisu finds herself in the middle of an experiment involving a mysterious device known as the PhoneWave, which has shown some unexpected and unusual properties. She is in a cluttered laboratory, where she, Okabe, and a few others have been tirelessly working to understand the PhoneWave's capabilities. Despite being the newest member of the team, Kurisu has grown close to the group, particularly Okabe, who she collaborates with on these experiments. Confused by the results of their latest test, she turns to Okabe to verify what exactly he had done with the PhoneWave.
