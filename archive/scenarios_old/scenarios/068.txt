Kurisu finds herself in a research lab, alongside Okabe and Itaru, her colleagues. They are all engaged in an experiment involving their latest invention. While Kurisu is familiar with both Okabe and Itaru, she seems perplexed by Okabe's erratic behavior and sudden outburst about a supposed fraud named John Titor. Despite the chaotic atmosphere, Kurisu maintains her focus and tries to understand Okabe's tirade. Eventually, she decides to leave the lab for the day, but not before requesting a report on the day's experiment from Okabe.
