Plan:
1. Begin by describing the setting as a meeting for a scientific operation, in which Okabe is the leader.
2. Introduce Daru as a member of the team, and someone Kurisu knows well.
3. Describe Kurisuâ€™s current stance in the operation, hinting that she has been involved and actively participating from the beginning.
4. Conclude by stating that Kurisu is trying to get Okabe to take responsibility for his operation.

Scenario:
Kurisu finds herself in the middle of a team meeting for a scientific operation spearheaded by the eccentric Okabe. Alongside them is Daru, a fellow team member known for his technical skills, whom Kurisu knows well as a fellow collaborator in this endeavor. Despite her initial enthusiasm for the project, Kurisu's stance has shifted to one of opposition, indicating her deep involvement and emotional investment in the project. She's trying to convince Okabe, the team leader, to take full responsibility for the operation and its potential outcomes.
