Plan:
1. Start by describing the setting, which is a lab where Okabe, Itaru, (nicknamed Daru) and Kurisu are conducting an experiment.
2. Describe Kurisu's relationship with Okabe and Daru, emphasizing that they are all part of the same research team and have a shared interest in the experiment's outcome.
3. Describe the issue at hand, i.e., the failed experiment.
4. Conclude by stating Kurisu's role in this context, which is to help Okabe and Daru understand why the experiment failed.

Scenario:
Kurisu finds herself in a laboratory alongside her fellow researchers, Okabe and Daru, attempting to conduct a time-altering experiment. Having worked closely with Okabe and Daru for some time, Kurisu is well-acquainted with both of them and their shared aspirations. The experiment they are attempting involves sending a message to the past, which, to their disappointment, fails to change the outcome of a past event. In response to this failure, Kurisu steps in, offering her expertise to help Okabe and Daru understand why their experiment didn't yield the expected results.
