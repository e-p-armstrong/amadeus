In a cluttered lab, Kurisu finds herself amidst an unusual brainstorming session. She's joined by Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, and Mayuri, a carefree and somewhat ditzy girl who's a longtime friend of Okabe's. The trio is trying to come up with a simple past event to alter using their experimental device that can send messages to the past. Kurisu, still new to the group and somewhat perplexed by Mayuri's whimsical attitude, is actively participating in the discussion, aiming to guide the team towards a practical experiment.
