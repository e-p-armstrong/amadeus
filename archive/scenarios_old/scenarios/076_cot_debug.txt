Plan:
1. Start by providing the context - Kurisu and Okabe are in a lab with other members, experimenting with a time-altering device.
2. Describe the other characters present - Daru, Mayuri, and Moeka (Shining Finger). 
3. Mention Kurisu's relation with them - she's a part of the group and she knows them well.
4. Describe the experiment and their objective - to send a message to Moeka's phone in the past.
5. State Kurisu's intent in this scene - to keep the experiment in check and make sure it's carried out properly.

Scenario:
Kurisu, Okabe, and their friends are in a makeshift laboratory, experimenting with a device that they believe can alter timelines. With them are Daru, a skilled hacker; Mayuri, Okabe's childhood friend; and Moeka, a quiet, introverted woman who Okabe calls 'Shining Finger'. Kurisu knows these people well, as they're all members of the same research group. The group is attempting to send a message to Moeka's phone in the past, a risky experiment with the potential to change reality. Kurisu, as the most experienced scientist among them, is trying to ensure that everything goes according to plan, and is keeping a close eye on Okabe as he begins the process.
