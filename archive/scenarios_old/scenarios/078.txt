In the middle of a tense discussion in their lab, Okabe and his fellow lab members, Kurisu, Itaru, and Mayuri, are trying to decipher a strange occurrence involving another associate named Moeka. Kurisu and the others are well-acquainted lab partners who have been through numerous scientific endeavors together. The current issue revolves around Okabe's claim of a unique ability he calls "Reading Steiner", which he believes allows him to sense changes in timelines. As a logic-driven scientist, Kurisu is skeptical about Okabe's claim and aims to question him further to understand the true nature of this strange phenomenon.
