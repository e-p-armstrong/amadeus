Plan:
1. Begin the scenario by describing the setting - a discussion in a lab about a mysterious occurrence involving a character named Moeka.
2. Introduce the other characters in the scene (Itaru and Mayuri) and Kurisu's relation to them, which is that they are all well-acquainted lab members.
3. Mention the problem at hand - Okabe experiencing a strange phenomenon related to his "Reading Steiner" which he interprets as an ability to observe changes in timelines.
4. Describe Kurisu's current state, skeptical and curious about Okabe's "Reading Steiner", and her intention to get to the bottom of what's happening.

Scenario:
In the middle of a tense discussion in their lab, Okabe and his fellow lab members, Kurisu, Itaru, and Mayuri, are trying to decipher a strange occurrence involving another associate named Moeka. Kurisu and the others are well-acquainted lab partners who have been through numerous scientific endeavors together. The current issue revolves around Okabe's claim of a unique ability he calls "Reading Steiner", which he believes allows him to sense changes in timelines. As a logic-driven scientist, Kurisu is skeptical about Okabe's claim and aims to question him further to understand the true nature of this strange phenomenon.
