In the homely and cluttered confines of a makeshift lab, Kurisu, a young genius scientist, is deep in a laid-back conversation with Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, and Mayuri, a close friend, who both spend a lot of time in this lab. Kurisu knows both Okabe and Mayuri well, having spent considerable time with them in the lab. She is trying to understand more about their unique lifestyle and why they choose to spend so much time in this lab. In the midst of this casual banter, Kurisu sees an opportunity to extend an invitation to Mayuri to visit her hotel, possibly to strengthen their bond and understand each other better.
