Following a light-hearted debate among friends, Kurisu finds herself in a conversation with Okabe, an enigmatic scientist she collaborates with, alongside their less scientifically inclined friends, Mayuri, Itaru, and Luka. She knows them all well and appreciates their unique perspectives. The conversation turns to the potential use of their shared invention, the PhoneWave, to experiment on a peculiar wish by Luka - to change his gender. Kurisu, intrigued by the unusual application of their technology, is considering whether to entertain Okabe's proposition.
