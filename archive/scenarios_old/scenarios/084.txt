Kurisu finds herself amidst a brainstorming session in a lab, working on an experiment involving the concept of sending messages to the past. Alongside her are Okabe, the eccentric lead of the group; Daru, a hacker with a lewd sense of humor; Mayuri, a gentle and cheerful girl; and Luka, a timid and soft-spoken boy. She knows them well, as they are all part of the same research team. Engaging in a lively debate, Kurisu attempts to keep the group focused and contribute her own ideas to the discussion. She is trying to challenge Okabe to think critically and come up with a feasible solution for their experiment.
