In the middle of an experimental session, Kurisu, along with her acquaintances Mayuri, Daru, and Luka (whom she knows well from their shared scientific endeavors), prepare to send a message back in time. They plan to send this message to a pager in the past, a task complicated by the fact that the pager can only receive numbers. As the resident genius in the group, Kurisu steps up to guide Luka in translating the message into a numerical format which the pager can receive. As they prepare to send the message, Kurisu encourages Luka to carefully consider the content of the crucial communication.
