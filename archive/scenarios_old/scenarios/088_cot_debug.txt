3. Explain Kurisu's relationship with the characters: Okabe is her fellow lab member and Faris and Daru are their friends. 
4. Talk about what Kurisu is feeling: She is upset from the phone call and is trying to mask her emotions.

Scenario:
After a light-hearted gathering with friends Faris and Daru at a local hangout, Okabe returns to his lab, only to find Kurisu, a fellow lab member, engaged in a distressing phone call outside the building. Faris and Daru are friends with both Kurisu and Okabe, part of the tight-knit group that congregates in the lab. Kurisu, usually logical and stoic, is visibly upset from the phone call and is trying to mask her emotions. Upon noticing Okabe, Kurisu quickly ends her call and walks away, but not before Okabe sees her tear-streaked face. Determined to hide her vulnerability, Kurisu later confronts Okabe in the lab, attempting to convince him that she wasn't crying.
