Plan:
1. Start by explaining that Kurisu is in a place where she is with Okabe and other friends, Mayuri and Daru.
2. Describe briefly the relationship Kurisu has with these friends. 
3. Explain Kurisu's emotional state at the start of the conversation, which seems to be troubled or upset.
4. End with Kurisu's intention in the conversation, which is initially to avoid interaction but gradually changes as Okabe speaks.

Scenario:
Kurisu finds herself in a private gathering with Okabe and her other friends, Mayuri and Daru. She has grown close to them over time, forming a bond of trust and camaraderie. Despite this, she seems to be in a troubled state, initially refusing to communicate with Okabe. However, as Okabe insists on hearing her out, Kurisu slowly starts opening up, revealing her intention to share her worries with her friends.
