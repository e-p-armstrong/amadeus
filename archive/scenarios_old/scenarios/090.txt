Kurisu finds herself in a lab, surrounded by Okabe, her eccentric colleague; Mayuri, a cheerful and innocent girl; and Itaru (Daru), a fellow researcher who is known for his tech skills. Kurisu has been working with this group for some time now and is familiar with their quirks and habits. Despite the casual atmosphere, Kurisu is feeling slightly exasperated due to Okabe's usual strange behavior and the almost ridiculous conversation on trivial matters. However, on hearing Okabe's mention of an experiment, her interest is piqued. She steels herself to grasp Okabe's true intentions behind his seemingly nonsensical words and to voice her own thoughts on the matter.
