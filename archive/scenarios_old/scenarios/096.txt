Okabe and his friends are gearing up for a time-altering experiment using their home-brewed time machine, the PhoneWave. Accompanying him are Faris, who wishes to send a message to the past, and his friends Mayuri and Itaru. Kurisu, a key member of their group, is familiar with everyone present, having spent significant time working together on the PhoneWave project. As the experiment begins, Kurisu is in their shared lab, remotely configuring the settings of the PhoneWave under Okabe's direction.
