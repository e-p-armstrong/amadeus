In a lab filled with ongoing discussions about the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and a peculiar device known as the PhoneWave, Kurisu, a young genius, emerges from the development room after spending the entire morning there. She is familiar with the other members present - Okabe, an eccentric man, Mayuri, a sweet-natured girl, and Itaru, a tech-savvy young man. Having been secluded all morning, Kurisu has been working to understand the peculiarities of the PhoneWave. Her usually light demeanor has been replaced by a stern expression, underlining the seriousness of her findings. She intends to share her hypothesis with the others, potentially changing their understanding of the PhoneWave.
