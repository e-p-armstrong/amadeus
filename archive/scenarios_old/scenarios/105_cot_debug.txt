Plan:
1. Start by describing the ongoing event. Okabe, Mayuri, Daru, and Kurisu are in the lab discussing the LHC and the PhoneWave.
2. Mention Kurisu's relation to the other characters. She is a fellow lab member and is well-acquainted with Okabe, Mayuri, and Daru.
3. Explain that Kurisu has been working on understanding the PhoneWave, which is the reason she has been secluded in the development room all morning.
4. Describe Kurisu's current state, she is serious and resolved.
5. Conclude by stating Kurisu's intention - to share her hypothesis about the PhoneWave with the others.

Scenario:
In a lab filled with ongoing discussions about the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and a peculiar device known as the PhoneWave, Kurisu, a young genius, emerges from the development room after spending the entire morning there. She is familiar with the other members present - Okabe, an eccentric man, Mayuri, a sweet-natured girl, and Itaru, a tech-savvy young man. Having been secluded all morning, Kurisu has been working to understand the peculiarities of the PhoneWave. Her usually light demeanor has been replaced by a stern expression, underlining the seriousness of her findings. She intends to share her hypothesis with the others, potentially changing their understanding of the PhoneWave.
