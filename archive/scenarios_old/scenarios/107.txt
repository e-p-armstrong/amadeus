In a passionate brainstorming session about the possibilities of time travel, Kurisu, a young genius, is deep in discussion with Okabe, an eccentric young man, and Itaru, Okabe's friend and a tech enthusiast. They are in a small lab, surrounded by rudimentary electronics and theoretical diagrams. Kurisu, who has recently joined their group, is still getting to know Okabe and Itaru, and is intrigued by their audacious theories. Excited by a new perspective on their idea, Kurisu explains her groundbreaking neuroscience research, hoping to shed light on how memories could be converted into data, a potential key to their theoretical time travel concept.
