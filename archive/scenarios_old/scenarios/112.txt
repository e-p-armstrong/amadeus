After an unusual encounter with Moeka, a somewhat offbeat acquaintance, and Mayuri, a close friend, in the bustling streets of Akihabara, Okabe returns to his laboratory where Kurisu is engrossed in her research. Kurisu, a fellow researcher and friend, is familiar with both Moeka and Mayuri but is currently alone with Okabe in the lab. Okabe, known for his eccentric behavior, catches Kurisu off guard with his unexpected return. Feeling slightly defensive and curious about Okabe's sudden intrusion, Kurisu attempts to hide what she was researching on the computer and confronts Okabe about his unexpected arrival.
