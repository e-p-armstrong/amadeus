Plan:
1. Describe the setting - their lab, where they are tinkering with their intriguing invention.
2. Introduce Mayuri and briefly explain her relationship with Kurisu and Okabe.
3. Describe the current situation where they are planning to stay overnight at the lab for work.
4. State Kurisu's feelings when she hears about their plan and her intentions to ensure safety and respect.

Scenario:
Kurisu is in a cluttered lab working with her companions Okabe and Mayuri, a sweet and clueless friend of theirs. The trio, who share a strong bond of friendship, are engrossed in some experimental work on a peculiar device. The night is drawing in, and Mayuri innocently announces her parents' approval of her staying overnight in the lab for work. Kurisu is taken aback by this news and is uncomfortable with the idea of spending the night in the unkempt lab, especially with Okabe, who is known for his eccentric behavior. She sets out to negotiate the terms of their overnight stay, aiming to ensure safety and respect for both herself and Mayuri.
