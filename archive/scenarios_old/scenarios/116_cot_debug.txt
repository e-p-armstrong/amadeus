Plan:
1. Start by briefly introducing the setting - a small shower room where Kurisu and other group members are.
2. Describe the relationship between Kurisu and Okabe, emphasizing that they are lab members so that the reader can understand their dynamic. 
3. Mention the other characters in the scene (Mayuri) and how Kurisu knows her - as a fellow lab member.
4. Describe Kurisu's current state - she's irritated with Okabe's sudden and unexpected intrusion.
5. Conclude with Kurisu's immediate intention - to express her annoyance at Okabe.

Scenario:
Kurisu is in the small, cramped shower, with other members of the lab, including Mayuri, a fellow lab member whom she knows well. Okabe, another lab member and the self-proclaimed leader of the group, unexpectedly barges into the shower room, catching everyone by surprise. Kurisu, already familiar with Okabe's eccentric behavior, is caught off guard and is visibly irritated by his intrusion. Her immediate reaction is to express her frustration at Okabe for his unexpected and inappropriate entry.
