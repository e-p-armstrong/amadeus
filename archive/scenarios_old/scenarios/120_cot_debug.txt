Plan:
1. Describe the main activity that all characters are involved in - finishing a project.
2. Briefly introduce the minor characters (Mayuri and Itaru) in the scene and their relation to Kurisu.
3. Describe Kurisu's state of mind - she is aware of the potential dangers of their invention.
4. Set the direction of the scene by stating what Kurisu is trying to do - explain how the Time Leap Machine works.

Scenario:
In a late-night work session, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru, are putting the final touches on their latest invention. Mayuri, a friend and a talented cosplay designer, and Itaru, a fellow researcher and friend, are both well-known to Kurisu. Despite the casual banter and light-hearted competition, Kurisu is sobered by the realization of the potential implications of their new creation. She prepares to explain the workings of the Time Leap Machine, intending to make sure everyone understands exactly what they've created.
