Inside a bustling research lab, Kurisu, a young genius, and her companions, including the eccentric Okabe and the ever-innocent Mayuri, have just completed an invention they call the Time Leap Machine. Kurisu plays a crucial role in the group due to her vast knowledge and skills, and she has been working closely with Okabe and the others on the project. Despite being relatively new to the group, she has quickly established strong bonds with Okabe and Mayuri. Following an intense discussion about the potential risks of their invention, they decide against testing it. Feeling a sense of relief about their decision, Kurisu seeks to express her gratitude to Okabe, the group's leader, for his wise choice.
