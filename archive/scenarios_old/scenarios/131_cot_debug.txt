Following a disorienting experience with a device designed to send memories to the past, Okabe finds himself struggling with extreme physical and mental discomfort. He is in a research lab, the home of the said machine, with Kurisu, a fellow researcher and friend, who is well-acquainted with both Okabe and the machine, having contributed significantly to its development. Kurisu, seeing Okabe in distress, is concerned and perplexed by his extreme reactions. Despite the chaos, she attempts to bring him back to reality, reminding him of their mundane plan â€“ a shopping trip they had scheduled.
