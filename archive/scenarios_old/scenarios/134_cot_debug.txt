Plan:
1. Start by describing what has just happened - Okabe's time-leap, which Kurisu has helped him with.
2. Mention that Kurisu knows Okabe, Suzuha, and Moeka (all present in the room), and describe their relationships briefly.
3. Describe Kurisu's current state - perplexed by Okabe's sudden action of time-leaping.
4. State what Kurisu intends to do - understand what's happening and why Okabe is behaving in the way he is.

Scenario:
In the midst of a tense standoff with Moeka and Suzuha, Okabe, with Kurisu's assistance, has just executed a time-leap - a process of sending his memories to the past. Kurisu is acquainted with Okabe, Suzuha, and Moeka: Okabe is her colleague, Suzuha is a time-travelling acquaintance, and Moeka is a reluctant adversary. Kurisu, who has been supporting Okabe through these time-leaps, is taken aback by Okabe's sudden decision to leap without much explanation. She wants to understand Okabe's urgency and his plan, and is trying to question him about his actions.
