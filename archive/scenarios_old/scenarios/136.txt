Amid a tense phone call, Okabe frantically instructs his childhood friend, Mayuri, to stay put at a shrine and not to use any public transport. Kurisu is present in the same room as Okabe, overhearing the conversation. She also knows Mayuri and Luka, who is facilitating the call, through their mutual friendship with Okabe. In the midst of Okabe's panic, Kurisu, still groggy and half-asleep, tries to understand the sudden urgency in Okabe's instructions to their friends. Despite Okabe's frantic behavior, Kurisu musters the energy to question him, attempting to grasp the situation.
