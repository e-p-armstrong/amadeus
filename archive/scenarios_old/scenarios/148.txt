Kurisu is in a meeting with Okabe, her eccentric colleague, and two others: Itaru, a friend known for his lighthearted demeanor, and Suzuha, a mysterious young woman with knowledge of the future. The atmosphere is heavy with a discussion about the intricate model of the universe and its numerous possibilities. Kurisu, a genius scientist, is engaged in a deep conversation with Suzuha about this complex theory. As the concepts of "worldlines" and "attractor fields" are introduced by Suzuha, Kurisu, intrigued and slightly skeptical, seeks to comprehend this new perspective on the universe's structure.
