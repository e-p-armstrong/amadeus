Because of a damaged time machine that a group of friends has discovered, Kurisu is in their shared lab along with Okabe, the group's leader; Suzuha, who arrived from the future with the damaged machine; and Itaru, another member of their lab. Kurisu knows Suzuha as a time traveler, Itaru as a fellow lab member, and Okabe as a close ally. Despite the tension in the room, she's trying to find a solution to their problem by suggesting the use of another device they have: a time leap machine, which could allow them to avoid the damage to Suzuha's time machine.
