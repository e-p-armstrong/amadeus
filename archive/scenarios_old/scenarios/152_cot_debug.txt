Scenario:
Kurisu finds herself in a serious gathering of her friends, where Okabe, a fellow scientist and friend, outlines his plan to leap back in time. She shares a comfortable rapport with Okabe and Itaru, another member of their science team, and they often engage in light-hearted banter. However, Suzuha, a recent addition, is someone Kurisu is still getting to know. As Okabe unfolds his intentions to save their friend Mayuri, Kurisu, despite her rational personality, offers her support and tries to make sense of his ambitious plan.
