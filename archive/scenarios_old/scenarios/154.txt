After an unsuccessful day spent searching for a unique pin with Suzuha, a friend and lab member, Okabe finds himself in a development room with Kurisu, a fellow scientist and collaborator. Kurisu is well acquainted with both Okabe and Suzuha, having worked closely with them on various projects. However, she's currently puzzled by the strange device that Suzuha brought into the lab, a ‘divergence meter’ that supposedly measures changes in worldlines. Determined to understand the workings of this seemingly impossible device, Kurisu prepares to engage in a discussion with Okabe and Suzuha, hoping to unravel the mystery of the divergence meter.
