In a makeshift lab, Kurisu, Okabe, and Suzuha, a time traveler they've recently met, are engrossed in the task of building a time machine. Kurisu collaborates closely with Okabe on scientific matters, but she has only recently met Suzuha, who has come from the future with a broken time machine. The group's current task is driven by the need to repair Suzuha's time machine and to help her find her father. In the midst of their complex and challenging work, Kurisu decides to open up to Okabe about her views on time travel, aiming to assure him that she doesn't feel conflicted about their current project.
