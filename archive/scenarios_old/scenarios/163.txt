Following a discussion on time travel, Kurisu finds herself in the lab with her close friends, Okabe, Daru, and Mayuri. As they chat, Tennouji, their landlord, interrupts with a knock on the door. Kurisu knows Tennouji, but isn't as close to him as she is with the others present. The conversation had taken a turn towards the implications of time travel on personal relationships, and as Mayuri begins to divulge information that could potentially expose their secret, Kurisu's main concern becomes preventing Mayuri from revealing too much to Tennouji.
