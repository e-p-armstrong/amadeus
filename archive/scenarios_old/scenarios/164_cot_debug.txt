Plan:
1. Start by describing the situation - Suzuha's letter describing her failure and the impact it has on the group.
2. Mention the characters present - Okabe, Daru, and Kurisu and their relationship to Suzuha.
3. Describe Kurisu's current state - calm and collected despite the emotional chaos.
4. Conclude by stating Kurisu's intention - to defuse the tension between Okabe and Daru.

Scenario:
The group, consisting of Okabe, Daru, and Kurisu, is in a state of shock after reading a letter from Suzuha, a time-traveler and Daru's future daughter, confessing her failure in a crucial mission. Okabe, a friend and de facto leader of the group is overwhelmed with grief and frustration, blaming Daru, Suzuha's future father, for the failed repair of the time machine. Kurisu, a genius scientist and a key member of the group, knows both Okabe and Daru well and understands the gravity of Suzuha's failure. Amidst the emotional turmoil, Kurisu maintains her composure, intending to mediate the growing tension between Okabe and Daru.
