Plan:
1. Begin with a brief background that explains the scene, focusing on Okabe's failed attempt to alter the timeline.
2. Describe the setting where Kurisu, Okabe, and Mayuri are, which is in their lab.
3. Explain Kurisu's relationship with the other characters present in the scene. She knows Okabe and Mayuri well, as they are her fellow lab members.
4. End with Kurisu's intent in the scene. Kurisu is trying to understand Okabe's odd behavior and help him with his problem.

Scenario:
Following a failed intervention in the timeline, Kurisu finds herself in the lab alongside Okabe and Mayuri, unaware of the harrowing events that unfolded in the previous timeline. She is well-acquainted with both Okabe and Mayuri, given their shared involvement in the lab's time travel experiments. Okabe's behavior is peculiar, hinting at a problem he's struggling with, which piques Kurisu's curiosity. As Okabe requests her help, Kurisu is determined to unravel the mystery behind his distress and assist him in finding a solution.
