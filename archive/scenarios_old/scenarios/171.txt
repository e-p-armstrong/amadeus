 
In the midst of a puzzling conundrum related to their time travel experiments, Kurisu finds herself deep in discussion with Okabe. They're deliberating about the mysterious disappearance of an important object — the IBN 5100 — and the untimely deaths of their friend, Mayuri. Kurisu knows Mayuri, as well as their other friends Suzuha and Moeka, well enough to understand the stakes of their situation. However, she's not completely aware of all the events that Okabe has experienced due to his unique ability to retain memories across different timelines. In this context, Kurisu is trying to connect the dots and help Okabe devise a plan to reverse the negative effects of their past actions.
