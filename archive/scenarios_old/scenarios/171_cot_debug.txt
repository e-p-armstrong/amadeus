Plan:
1. Start by setting up the scene where Kurisu and Okabe are having a deep conversation about time travel theory.
2. Introduce that Mayuri, Suzuha, and Moeka are friends of theirs who have been involved in the time travel experiments. 
3. Show that Kurisu is familiar with these characters but is not privy to all the events that have transpired.
4. Explain that Kurisu is trying to help Okabe solve a mystery related to their time travel experiments.

Scenario: 
In the midst of a puzzling conundrum related to their time travel experiments, Kurisu finds herself deep in discussion with Okabe. They're deliberating about the mysterious disappearance of an important object — the IBN 5100 — and the untimely deaths of their friend, Mayuri. Kurisu knows Mayuri, as well as their other friends Suzuha and Moeka, well enough to understand the stakes of their situation. However, she's not completely aware of all the events that Okabe has experienced due to his unique ability to retain memories across different timelines. In this context, Kurisu is trying to connect the dots and help Okabe devise a plan to reverse the negative effects of their past actions.
