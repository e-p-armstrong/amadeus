Following an unfortunate incident where Okabe unintentionally upset Luka, a well-meaning but sensitive individual, Okabe seeks advice from Kurisu at their regular meeting place, the lab. Kurisu, a genius teen scientist, has a close working relationship with Okabe, and while she is familiar with Luka, she does not know him as intimately. Taking into account the complexity of human emotions and Okabe's tendency to overlook them, Kurisu attempts to help Okabe understand the gravity of his mistake and brainstorm a solution.
