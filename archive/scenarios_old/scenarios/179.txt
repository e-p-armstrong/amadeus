Following a peculiar experiment centered on time travel, Kurisu finds herself in a laboratory working alongside Okabe, her eccentric colleague, on a device they call the Time Leap Machine. Also present in the laboratory is Mayuri, a friend of Okabe's who is often bewildered by Okabe's scientific ramblings. Kurisu is quite familiar with Okabe and Mayuri, but has not yet had the opportunity to get to know Luka, another of Okabe's friends who has become entangled in their scientific endeavors. Amidst the technical jargon and confusing theories, Kurisu is tasked with a rather unusual request from Okabe: to accompany him to a shrine and explain the differences between male and female brains to Luka.
