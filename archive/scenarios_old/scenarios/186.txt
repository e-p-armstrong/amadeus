Following a day of intense strategizing over the enigmatic D-Mails, Kurisu finds herself in the lab with Okabe and Mayuri, their mutual friend and fellow enthusiast of their scientific endeavors. Kurisu knows Mayuri well, as they are both lab members and close friends. She also knows Okabe well, as they have been working together on the D-Mail project. Two other friends, Daru, a fellow scientist, and Luka, a kind-hearted shrine maiden, are also mentioned although they are not present. In the casual setting, Kurisu is contentedly sharing a meal with Mayuri and Okabe, enjoying a moment of respite. However, when Okabe makes an assumption about her interest in Mayuri's cosplay stories, Kurisu feels the need to correct him, striving to maintain her own autonomy amidst the friendly banter.
