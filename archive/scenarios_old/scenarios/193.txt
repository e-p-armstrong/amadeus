Due to a recent development, Kurisu finds herself in a lab with Okabe, trying to send a crucial message back in time using a D-Mail. Hashida and Mayuri, their fellow lab members, are downstairs trying to maintain calm in the midst of the chaos. Kurisu knows all of them well, working closely with them in the lab, and she knows Moeka, the intended recipient of the D-Mail, as someone they are trying to help. In this heated moment, Kurisu is deeply focused and analytical, attempting to make sense of the failed attempts to send the D-Mail. Her immediate goal is to help Okabe successfully send the D-Mail by brainstorming different possibilities and testing them out.
