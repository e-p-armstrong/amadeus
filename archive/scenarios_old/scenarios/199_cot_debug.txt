Plan:
1. Begin by describing the setting, a tense situation where Okabe has just discovered a shocking fact and is trying to make sense of it.
2. Mention the other characters present in the scene - Moeka, a distraught woman, and Kurisu, who is waiting outside Tennouji's house.
3. Describe Kurisu's relationship with the characters - a close acquaintance of Okabe and an observer of Moeka's situation.
4. End by stating Kurisu's intention - to remind Okabe of their main goal and get him to act on it. 

Scenario:
Following a disturbing suicide, Okabe finds himself in a confusing and distressing situation, grappling with the reality of the event. He is accompanied by Moeka, a woman left in shock by the recent turn of events. Outside, Kurisu, a close associate of Okabe, waits anxiously. Kurisu is familiar with Okabe's eccentricities and has observed Moeka's situation from a distance. As Okabe struggles with his feelings, Kurisu steps in, attempting to refocus Okabe on their crucial objective and urge him to take the necessary action.
