After a long night of work, Kurisu finds herself in a room with Okabe and Itaru (also known as Daru), two fellow team members she has come to know well. The atmosphere is tense as Okabe passionately rants about their plans, with frequent references to a mysterious organization called SERN. Kurisu, exhausted and irritated by Okabe's theatrics, is trying to understand his thought process and the risks involved in their plan. Despite her fatigue, she is determined to confront Okabe and get him to explain his ideas in a more reasonable and coherent manner.
