Plan:

1. Begin by mentioning the setting - a somber moment where Okabe is on the roof of a building, grieving over a friend's death.
2. Explain Okabe's relationship with Mayuri and his guilt over her death.
3. Mention the dilemma Okabe is facing - that he has to choose between the death of Mayuri and Kurisu, but without getting into the details of time travel.
4. Introduce Kurisu as someone Okabe knows well, and who is also involved in the situation, without revealing her role as a scientist.
5. Conclude by stating what Kurisu's intention is - to find Okabe and talk to him.

Scenario:

In a quiet, sorrowful night, Okabe is found on the rooftop of a building, mourning the loss of his close friend, Mayuri. He holds himself responsible for her tragic demise, his heart heavy with guilt and sadness. Amidst this grief, Okabe is grappling with a painful choice that could further alter the lives of those close to him. His comrade, Kurisu, a familiar face deeply involved in the same predicament, seeks him out to provide solace and possibly find a solution. Spotting Okabe, she approaches him, ready to engage in a serious conversation about their current situation.
