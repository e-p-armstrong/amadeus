Plan:
1. Describe the setting: an intense discussion between Kurisu and Okabe about theories of time-travel.
2. Introduce the other characters mentioned in the scene: Hashida (also known as Daru), and Mayuri, who are both friends and lab members along with Kurisu and Okabe.
3. Describe Kurisu's relation to these characters: she knows them well as they work together in the lab.
4. Describe Kurisu's intention: she is trying to challenge Okabe's understanding of time-travel and propose her own hypothesis.

Scenario:
Following a deep dive into the waters of time-travel theories, Kurisu finds herself in a heated discussion with Okabe. They are joined by their fellow lab members, Hashida, who is often referred to as Daru, and Mayuri, both of whom Kurisu knows well and works alongside regularly. As the argument unfolds, Kurisu begins to question the accepted model of time-travel, challenging Okabe's steadfast belief in it. Intent on proposing her own hypothesis and potentially reshaping their understanding of time, Kurisu delves into her specialized field of neuroscience, hoping to convince Okabe to consider her perspective.
