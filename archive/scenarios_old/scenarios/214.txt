Following a visit to a grave with his close friend Mayuri, Okabe finds himself wrestling with a dire decision that could mean life or death for someone he cares about. Amidst the quiet city streets, now bare as the locals have flocked to an event, he seeks solitude on the rooftop of a building. Mayuri, a kind-hearted girl who shares a deep bond with Okabe and Kurisu, remains unaware of Okabe's internal struggle. On the rooftop, Okabe stumbles upon Kurisu, a fellow researcher and friend lying sprawled out, deep in thought. Recognizing the gravity of her situation, Kurisu, despite her initial surprise, intends to engage Okabe in a conversation about her own thoughts and fears.
