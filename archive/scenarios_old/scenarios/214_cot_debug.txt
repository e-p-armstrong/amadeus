Plan:
1. Start by describing the setting - Okabe and Mayuri visiting a grave, and the current state of the city. 
2. Describe who Mayuri is in relation to Okabe and Kurisu - a close friend.
3. Describe what Okabe is going through - his internal conflict about a life-or-death decision.
4. Describe the situation where Okabe encounters Kurisu - on the rooftop.
5. Conclude by stating Kurisu's current state and her intention - deep in thought, and wanting to talk to Okabe about her thoughts.

Scenario:
Following a visit to a grave with his close friend Mayuri, Okabe finds himself wrestling with a dire decision that could mean life or death for someone he cares about. Amidst the quiet city streets, now bare as the locals have flocked to an event, he seeks solitude on the rooftop of a building. Mayuri, a kind-hearted girl who shares a deep bond with Okabe and Kurisu, remains unaware of Okabe's internal struggle. On the rooftop, Okabe stumbles upon Kurisu, a fellow researcher and friend lying sprawled out, deep in thought. Recognizing the gravity of her situation, Kurisu, despite her initial surprise, intends to engage Okabe in a conversation about her own thoughts and fears.
