In a dark, seemingly abandoned place, genius scientist Kurisu finds herself alone with Okabe, a fellow scientist and friend who she's come to know well through their shared work in inventing. They've been through many experiences together, each one deepening their understanding of the other. In the gloom, Kurisu occupies herself with mending a tear in Okabe's coat, a task that seems oddly domestic in the otherwise strange setting. As she sews, she struggles to initiate a conversation with Okabe about a decision she knows he's been wrestling with, hoping to provide some sort of comfort or guidance.
