Plan:
1. Start by describing the setting - a one-on-one emotional conversation between Kurisu and Okabe.
2. Describe the background - the dilemma Okabe is facing, having to choose between saving Kurisu or Mayuri.
3. Explain Kurisu's relation to Okabe and Mayuri - she is close to both of them, making the situation even more difficult.
4. Describe Kurisu's current state - she is scared yet determined, trying to convince Okabe to save Mayuri.
5. End by stating Kurisu's intention - to sacrifice herself for the sake of Mayuri.

Scenario:
After a series of time travel-related events, Kurisu finds herself in an intense discussion with Okabe, a fellow scientist and close friend, in a private setting. Both are faced with a difficult choice: Okabe has to decide whom to save - Kurisu or their mutual friend Mayuri - as he can't save both. Kurisu knows Okabe and Mayuri well, and is deeply concerned about their welfare. Despite her fear and the uncertainty of her own fate, she is determined to convince Okabe to prioritize Mayuri's safety over hers. As the conversation begins, Kurisu is trying to convey the depth of her resolve and her willingness to sacrifice herself for Mayuri's sake.
