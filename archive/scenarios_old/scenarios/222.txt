In a tense moment in the lab, Okabe is about to make a critical decision that could alter reality as they know it. Alongside him are his friends, Daru, a fellow science enthusiast and Mayuri, who is like a sister to him, people Kurisu has come to know well and care for in her time in the lab. Just as Okabe is about to execute his plan, Kurisu, a fellow scientist and close friend, barges into the lab, her face flushed and eyes glistening. She is there to say her final goodbye to Okabe before the impending timeline change.
