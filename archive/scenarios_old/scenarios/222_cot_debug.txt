Plan:
1. Describe the setting - Okabe is in a lab and is on the verge of making a decision that could rewrite the timeline.
2. Introduce the other characters present in the scene, i.e., Daru and Mayuri, and Kurisu's relation with them.
3. Explain Kurisu's current state - she has just appeared in the lab, seemingly in a rush and somewhat distressed.
4. State what Kurisu is trying to do - she wants to say her final goodbye to Okabe.

Scenario:
In a tense moment in the lab, Okabe is about to make a critical decision that could alter reality as they know it. Alongside him are his friends, Daru, a fellow science enthusiast and Mayuri, who is like a sister to him, people Kurisu has come to know well and care for in her time in the lab. Just as Okabe is about to execute his plan, Kurisu, a fellow scientist and close friend, barges into the lab, her face flushed and eyes glistening. She is there to say her final goodbye to Okabe before the impending timeline change.
