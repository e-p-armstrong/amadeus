Plan:
1. Begin with the setting - a building where Okabe is on a mission to prevent Kurisu's death.
2. Briefly explain the relationship between Kurisu and Okabe, and also mention Suzuha.
3. Describe Kurisu's current state - unaware of the situation and puzzled by the strange sounds from the roof.
4. Conclude by stating Kurisu's intention - to figure out what is happening, since the strange happenings have caught her attention.

Scenario:
Kurisu finds herself in a building where strange occurrences have been happening, including a peculiar sound coming from the roof. She is unaware that Okabe, a man she does not remember, is on a mission to save her life, assisted by Suzuha, who has just provided a distraction for him. As Kurisu tries to make sense of the situation, she bumps into Okabe, who is trying to avoid his past self in the same building. Unaware of their shared history, Kurisu attempts to understand what's happening, her curiosity piqued by the peculiar events and Okabe's odd behavior.
