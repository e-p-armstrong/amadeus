Plan:
1. Start by explaining the setting - Kurisu is in a secluded area with her estranged father, Nakabachi.
2. Describe briefly who Nakabachi is in relation to Kurisu - her estranged father, a physicist who has been rejected by the scientific community.
3. Describe Kurisu's emotions and thoughts - fearful yet hopeful, attempting to reconcile with her father.
4. Finally, describe what Kurisu aims to do - present a thesis on time travel to her father and propose a collaboration to get it published.

Scenario:
Following a long separation, Kurisu finds herself in a private, secluded area with her estranged father, Nakabachi, a physicist whose work has been widely dismissed by his peers. Despite their past, Kurisu holds a glimmer of hope for reconciliation. She's feeling a mixture of fear and anticipation, as she's about to share a thesis she developed on the controversial subject of time travel. Her intention is not only to share her work with her father but also to propose a collaboration between them, hoping to mend their relationship and gain his approval in the process.
