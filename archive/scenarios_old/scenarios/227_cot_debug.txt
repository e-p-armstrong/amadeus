Plan:
1. Set the context by describing the tense situation Kurisu finds herself in with her father.
2. Describe Kurisu's relationship with Nakabachi, her estranged father, and Okabe, a person she barely knows.
3. Give a brief overview of Kurisu's emotions and thoughts, seeing her father's reprehensible behavior.
4. End by stating Kurisu's immediate goal, which is to confront her father about his actions.

Scenario:
In a high-stress situation, Kurisu finds herself confronting her estranged father, Nakabachi, about his unethical actions. Kurisu, a genius scientist, barely knows Okabe, an eccentric young man who's also present in the scene. As Nakabachi's shocking behavior unfolds, Kurisu feels a mixture of disbelief and hurt. Despite the tense circumstances, Kurisu musters up the courage to confront Nakabachi and question him about his disgraceful behavior.
