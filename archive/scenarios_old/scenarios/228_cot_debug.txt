3. Describe Kurisu's current state, she is terrified and concerned for both Okabe and her father, Nakabachi. 
4. Conclude by stating Kurisu's intention - to stop the fight between Okabe and Nakabachi.

Scenario:
In the midst of a violent confrontation, Okabe faces off against Nakabachi, a man who has been driven to madness. Kurisu, who is familiar with both Okabe, a close friend and collaborator, and Nakabachi, her estranged father, watches the escalating conflict with a mix of fear and concern. The standoff takes place in a deserted hallway, far from any potential help. Terrified but resolute, Kurisu steps in with the intention to diffuse the situation and prevent it from turning fatal.
