Plan:
1. Begin by describing the setting and the events happening - Okabe is observing a sequence of events unfold at a lecture hall.
2. Mention the characters present in the scene and their relation to Kurisu.
3. Describe Kurisu's actions leading up to her first line in the conversation, including her finding the Upa.
4. End with Kurisu's intention to confront Nakabachi, who she refers to as "Papa", meaning he is her father.

Scenario:
In an inconspicuous corner of a bustling lecture hall, Kurisu finds herself caught in a chain of events orchestrated by Okabe, a fellow participant. In this chaotic scenario, Kurisu comes across a small, misplaced trinket (Upa) which she unknowingly becomes a part of Okabe's plan. At this point in time, she is unfamiliar with Mayuri, the original owner of the trinket but is aware of Okabe's presence. Amidst the unraveling events, Kurisu, in her determination, decides to confront a man referred to as 'Papa', revealing a personal connection and indicating her intention to have a serious conversation with him.
