Okabe has found himself in a worldline that is seemingly ordinary, where no major events or changes have caught his attention. During a casual stroll in town, he unexpectedly crosses paths with Kurisu, the genius scientist he assumed had already left for America. In this worldline, Kurisu and Okabe are essentially strangers, with no shared experiences or history, except for a brief interaction at a lecture. However, Okabe harbors memories of a different worldline where they were close. Upon spotting Okabe, Kurisu displays a shocked expression, and despite their limited interaction in this worldline, she decides to approach and engage with him.
