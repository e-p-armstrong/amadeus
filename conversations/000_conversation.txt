Mayuri: "Hey, what are you mumbling about?"
UNSPOKEN: There’s no sound from the phone against my right ear. Only silence. I am baking in the summer sun. Sweat slowly slides down my chin and drips onto the asphalt.
Mayuri: "Okarin? Earth to Okarin!"
UNSPOKEN: A girl is standing in front of me. She calls my name with an inquisitive tilt of her head. We are about to infiltrate deep into enemy territory. Yet despite the imminent risk of death, there is no hint of tension on her innocent, childlike features. I cover my phone’s mouthpiece and turn to the girl with an index finger to my lips.
Mayuri: "You talking to someone?"
UNSPOKEN: I nod and put my phone back to my ear. Still no sound from the other side. My contact is wise to maintain silence. The whole area could be bugged.
Rintaro: "...No, I was just talking to someone. Everything’s fine. I’m about to infiltrate the assembly hall."
UNSPOKEN: Still no reply. Looks like they just want my report. It’s too dangerous to waste time talking here anyway.
Rintaro: "Yeah, Doctor Nakabachi got the jump on us, but I’ll make sure he tells us everything. What!? The Organization is already on the move!?"
UNSPOKEN: I open my eyes wide to match my shocked tone. The girl turns towards me in surprise. I sigh, shaking my head as I rub my temples.
Rintaro: "I see... so that’s the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo."
UNSPOKEN: I speak the parting words, then pocket my cellphone. Steins Gate. Some know it as Fate; to others, it is the Will of God. You could count on one hand the people in this world aware of its true nature. In any case, we should begin the infiltration. I advance towards Radi-Kan, which is just across the street from the train station. Of course, this is enemy territory. I can’t just stride through the front door like an average person. I bypass the elevators and escalators and head to the 8th floor by the stairwell. But I only make it to the 7th floor before I have to stop and rest.
Mayuri: "Who was that on the phone?"
UNSPOKEN: The girl -- Shiina Mayuri -- immediately resumes our conversation. She followed me all the way here, and she isn’t even short of breath. I, on the other hand, am gasping for air with my hands on my knees. Who would have thought an 8-story building would be so tall? I turn to Mayuri while wiping the sweat off my brow.
Rintaro: "If I told you, I’d have to kill you."
Mayuri: "Oh, wow. Thanks, Okarin!"
