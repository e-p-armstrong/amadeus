UNSPOKEN: Mayuri insists on calling me Okarin, but it’s neither my real name nor my codename. It’s just one of those annoying nicknames people use.
Rintaro: "How many times do I have to tell you? Don’t call me Okarin."
Mayuri: "Huh? But I’ve always called you that."
Rintaro: "That was then! I have since become Hououin Kyouma, the insane mad scientist hunted by secret organizations the world over. Muhahaha!"
Mayuri: "But that’s too hard to remember."
UNSPOKEN: In any case, Hououin Kyouma is my true name.
Mayuri: "And besides, it doesn’t even sound like Okabe Rintaro. You’re weird, ehehe!"
UNSPOKEN: Cease your foolish laughter! Okabe Rintaro may be my real name, but I have rejected it, for it is stupid. And so I also hate the derivative Okarin. Come on, it sounds like that elf boy’s blue pipe thing.
Mayuri: "So, Okarin, can I ask you something?"
UNSPOKEN: In one ear and out the other. She’s been calling me that for five years now, so maybe it’s time to give up.
Mayuri: "What are we doing here?"
Rintaro: "Wait. You followed me here without knowing why?"
Mayuri: "Yup."
UNSPOKEN: She nods without dropping her smile.
Rintaro: "We’re here for Doctor Nakabachi’s press conference."
UNSPOKEN: We’re standing in the assembly hall on the 8th floor of Radi-Kan. It is here that the conference will be held. Doctor Nakabachi is an inventor. He appears on TV from time to time and has a few patents under his belt, but mostly he is treated as a curiosity.
Mayuri: "Press conference? But where are the reporters?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri’s right. I’ve scanned the entire hall, but there’s no one who looks like a reputable reporter or cameraman. There are only about ten of us standing in the hall, including me. Considering Nakabachi’s moderate media presence and the fact that he claims to have invented a time machine, I would have expected more.
Rintaro: "Could this be the Organization working its twisted influence?"
UNSPOKEN: I twist my lips into a sneer. I thought that Nakabachi was like me, a scientist fighting to overthrow the Organization. But this press conference suggests other motives at work. Our enemies won’t miss this chance.
Rintaro: "I’d prefer not to get wrapped up in his mess."
UNSPOKEN: Nevertheless, I’m interested in what he has to say. That’s why I’m here, blowing an afternoon of my precious summer holiday. Mayuri ponders my utterance for a while before finally turning her head.
Mayuri: "You wrapped something? Is it his birthday too? Ehehe!"
UNSPOKEN: I let out a sigh. Mayuri is known to not only make bad jokes, but to laugh at them too. She’s always been... special.
Rintaro: "Keep your guard up, Mayuri. I suspect this won’t be a normal confer--"
