Rintaro: Guh!
UNSPOKEN: This is bad. Ordinary methods don't work on Makise Kurisu, the genius girl. On the contrary, she's the one psyching me out! Damn. Looks like I'll have to make a tactical retreat. If I can just find an opening! Suddenly, Kurisu steps up to me with a serious expression. She stares right at me, her huge eyes blazing with strength of will. Such fire. I can't look away. Could someone with such pure eyes really be an Organization agent?
Kurisu: What were you trying to tell me earlier?
UNSPOKEN: Earlier?
Rintaro: What are you talking about?
Kurisu: About fifteen minutes ago. Before the conference started.
UNSPOKEN: Nonsense. This is the first time we've met. I was with Mayuri and that Upa toy fifteen minutes ago.
Kurisu: You were trying to tell me something, right? You looked really upset.
UNSPOKEN: Is this a trap? It does seem like one of the Organization's dirty tricks. But would this girl do something that underhanded?
Kurisu: You looked like you were going to start crying any second. Why? Have we met before?
UNSPOKEN: She seems sincere. That makes her even more suspicious. That's right, don't let her beauty fool you! She's a cold, calculating secret agent. If I show the slightest vulnerability, I'm done for!
Kurisu: And how do you know my name?
Rintaro: My knowledge has no limits.
UNSPOKEN: I am a mad scientist, after all.
Rintaro: Genius girl, our next meeting shall be as enemies!
Kurisu: Huh?
