UNSPOKEN: And then a woman, who I assume is a staff member, appears to wave us back.
Woman: "The press conference will proceed as scheduled!"
UNSPOKEN: Is she trying to hide something? Her response was unusually quick, almost like she’s trying to keep me away from that device.
Rintaro: "I’ve got a nose for conspiracies, and this stinks of a coverup. What are they hiding? What was that explosion?"
UNSPOKEN: I want to know... but I shouldn’t risk getting any closer. I turn and leave... ...but not because I’m scared or anything like that. Staff members lead all of us back to the 8th floor. Mayuri is nowhere to be seen. She’s not in the event hall either. I find her on the 7th floor. Several capsule toy machines are lined up next to a plate reading Birthplace of the Japanese PC. She’s gazing upon them with a wistful look. I breathe a sigh of relief, then take out my phone.
Rintaro: "It’s me. I’ve got a bad feeling about this. Something’s happening, and I have no idea what it is. ...Yeah, I know. Don’t worry. I won’t do anything to jeopardize the mission. El Psy Kongroo."
UNSPOKEN: After I speak the words and hang up, I am able to wipe the sweat from my forehead. My sweat is cold. Half of me hopes something will happen. The other half fears the same thing. I put away my phone and look back at Mayuri. She’s still staring at those capsule toys. She doesn’t seem to be worried about the explosion at all. I can’t decide if she’s level-headed or just air-headed.
Rintaro: "What are you doing?"
Mayuri: "Hmm? Well... I really want an Upa."
UNSPOKEN: Just as I thought. Mayuri points to a capsule machine. The sign on the front says ’RaiNet Kakeru 3D Character Doll Series’. RaiNet Kakeru is a popular anime series with its own card game spinoff, RaiNet AccessBattlers. They even hold international tournaments. Upa is the series’s mascot character. It resembles an elliptical egg with limbs sticking out, like some kind of deformed dog. It’s what they call an uglycute character. High school girls find these creatures adorable for some reason. Last year, an ugly frog character was the rage. Its name escapes me, though.
Rintaro: "Then go for it. I can’t guarantee you’ll get an Upa, though."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri gives me a troubled smile.
Mayuri: "But Mayushii’s all out of 100-yen coins."
UNSPOKEN: Mayushii is what Mayuri calls herself sometimes. According to her, it’s supposed to have an ☆ at the end -- Mayushii☆. But who really cares?
Mayuri: "So, can I borrow 100 yen? Please?"
