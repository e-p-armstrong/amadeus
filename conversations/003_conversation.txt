UNSPOKEN: I pull out a 100-yen coin, set it into the machine’s slot, and spin the lever.
Mayuri: "Ah, ahh..."
UNSPOKEN: I open the capsule and take out the contents. Mayuri leans forward eagerly to see what I got.
Mayuri: "It’s an Upa! And it’s metal! A Metal Upa!"
Rintaro: "Is it rare?"
Mayuri: "Super rare!"
UNSPOKEN: While I examine the Metal Upa, a boy who was watching us tries his luck on the same RaiNet machine.
Boy: "Aw, a normal Upa..."
UNSPOKEN: He looks at my Metal Upa in resentment. I turn to see Mayuri’s sparkling eyes also fixed on the Upa. Hey, high school girl. You’re acting like a little kid.
Rintaro: "Hmph. I give this creature of metal to you, Mayuri."
UNSPOKEN: Honestly, I don’t want it.
Mayuri: "Really!? Are you sure, Okarin?"
Rintaro: "The name’s Hououin Kyouma!"
Mayuri: "Ehehe! Thank you, Okarin."
UNSPOKEN: Is she doing it on purpose?
Presenter: "Thank you all for coming to Doctor Nakabachi’s Time Machine Press Conference."
UNSPOKEN: I hear the announcement from the floor above.
Rintaro: "Sounds like they’re starting."
UNSPOKEN: I head to the stairs. But Mayuri doesn’t follow.
Rintaro: "Let’s go, Mayuri."
Mayuri: "Mm... just a sec. I gotta write my name."
UNSPOKEN: She’s preoccupied with the Metal Upa. I go on ahead.
Presenter: "Without further ado, I am pleased to introduce the inventor, Doctor Nakabachi! Please welcome him with a big round of applause!"
UNSPOKEN: Doctor Nakabachi enters to sparse applause. He walks up to the podium. He’s already wearing a frown, for some reason. I can feel his irritation from here.
Nakabachi: "I am Doctor Nakabachi. Thank you all for coming."
UNSPOKEN: Nakabachi takes the microphone and begins to speak, his voice brimming with confidence.
Nakabachi: "Now then, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin with my theory of time travel, the greatest scientific breakthrough of the century."
Mayuri: "Did he really build a time machine?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri appears after writing her name on the Metal Upa. She’s a bit late, in more ways than one. What did she think a time machine presentation would be about? I take another look around the room. There are about 20 people now, including us, but still no media presence to speak of. So this is the extent of Doctor Nakabachi’s fame. No one believes that he invented a time machine. I was interested in what he had to say, true, but my expectations were no higher than the rest of the onlookers. And a good thing they weren’t. As he proceeds to explain his time machine design, my curiosity quickly turns to disappointment, then anger.
Rintaro: "DOOOOOCTOOOOOOOORRR!!"
UNSPOKEN: My roar silences Nakabachi and draws the eye of every person in the room.
Rintaro: "Do you take us for fools!?"
Nakabachi: "Who the hell are you?"
Rintaro: "Who the hell am I!? Someone who knows you for a fraud, that’s who! You stole your theory from John Titor! And you call yourself an inventor!?"
