UNSPOKEN: Just then, someone grabs my arm from behind. Quite convinced it's an official here to throw me out, I turn around to glare him down.
Rintaro: Unhand me, you... huh?
UNSPOKEN: It's a girl about my age. Her intense stare seems to challenge me. I take a step back. Her face looks somehow familiar. Where have I seen her before?
Rintaro: Ah...
UNSPOKEN: We haven't met, but I know her face. It's Makise Kurisu. A few days ago, my friend Daru showed me a magazine article titled Girl Genius Gives Lecture in Akihabara. The article was about a 17-year-old girl who had just graduated from an American university. Her thesis was even published in a major scientific journal. Girl Genius, Makise Kurisu. I recognize the stubborn-looking girl from her photograph. She's even wearing the exact same scowl. What business could such a genius have with me? She takes a quick look around the room, then turns back to me with a stern expression.
Kurisu: Could you come with me for a moment?
UNSPOKEN: What's with the attitude? She's obviously not staff, and there's no way that the Makise Kurisu would be working with someone like Doctor Nakabachi. Which means... no!
Rintaro: Y-you're with the Organization!?
Kurisu: Huh?
Rintaro: If their tendrils have gotten this far, then I've made a grave mistake.
Kurisu: Stop fooling around and come with me.
UNSPOKEN: My outburst has already attracted too much attention. Nakabachi, in particular, looks like he wants to rip my head off. It must be mortifying to be exposed as a fraud by a bright young man like myself. Anyway, I mustn't draw any more attention to myself. If the Organization gets wind of my presence here, it could endanger Mayuri -- to say nothing of these ignorant civilians. I let Makise Kurisu lead me out of the assembly hall.
Rintaro: Try anything and people are sure to notice. What will your superiors say then?
Kurisu: What are you talking about?
UNSPOKEN: She glares at me. Quite fiercely at that. Attractive though she may be, there is no innocence in her eyes. A beautiful agent, unmatched in cruelty. My heart beats in exhilaration from the danger. Looks like chaos really does get my blood pumping. Heh heh heh.
Kurisu: I just need to ask you something.
Rintaro: What makes you think I'll answer? I know how the Organization operates.
Kurisu: What's with this 'Organization' stuff?
UNSPOKEN: Instead of answering, I take out my phone and put it to my ear.
Rintaro: It's me. I've been caught by an Organization agent. ...Yes, it's Makise Kurisu. She's a dangerous one. ...No, it's fine. I'll find a way to--
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu suddenly snatches the phone from my hand. What skill! I didn't have time to react.
Rintaro: What are you doing!?
Kurisu: Huh? Your phone's off. ...Who were you talking to?
