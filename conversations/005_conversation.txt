Kurisu: "Huh? Your phone’s off. ...Who were you talking to?"
UNSPOKEN: Her eyes pierce deep into my soul. I quickly look away. She’s good. Is she trying to attack my sense of identity in order to cause a mental break? Recover. This isn’t enough to sway me!
Rintaro: "Y-your techniques don’t work on me, but I’ll tell you anyway. That’s no ordinary phone. It’s designed to deactivate the moment it leaves my hand. Muhahaha!"
UNSPOKEN: Such measures are necessary to maintain secrecy. I know things that could get me killed. I quickly retrieve my phone and wipe the cold sweat off my forehead. Whew, that was close.
Kurisu: "...So you talk to yourself."
Rintaro: "Guh!"
UNSPOKEN: This is bad. Ordinary methods don’t work on Makise Kurisu, the genius girl. On the contrary, she’s the one psyching me out! Damn. Looks like I’ll have to make a tactical retreat. If I can just find an opening! Suddenly, Kurisu steps up to me with a serious expression. She stares right at me, her huge eyes blazing with strength of will. Such fire. I can’t look away. Could someone with such pure eyes really be an Organization agent?
Kurisu: "What were you trying to tell me earlier?"
UNSPOKEN: Earlier?
Rintaro: "What are you talking about?"
Kurisu: "About fifteen minutes ago. Before the conference started."
UNSPOKEN: Nonsense. This is the first time we’ve met. I was with Mayuri and that Upa toy fifteen minutes ago.
Kurisu: "You were trying to tell me something, right? You looked really upset."
UNSPOKEN: Is this a trap? It does seem like one of the Organization’s dirty tricks. But would this girl do something that underhanded?
Kurisu: "You looked like you were going to start crying any second. Why? Have we met before?"
UNSPOKEN: She seems sincere. That makes her even more suspicious. That’s right, don’t let her beauty fool you! She’s a cold, calculating secret agent. If I show the slightest vulnerability, I’m done for!
Kurisu: "And how do you know my name?"
Rintaro: "My knowledge has no limits."
UNSPOKEN: I am a mad scientist, after all.
Rintaro: "Genius girl, our next meeting shall be as enemies!"
Kurisu: "Huh?"
Rintaro: "Farewell! Muhahaha!"
UNSPOKEN: I spin around and take off down the stairs, ignoring her call to stop. Like I’d listen to the enemy.
Rintaro: "Damn the Organization! They must be serious if they’re sending in agents like her!"
UNSPOKEN: I run all the way down to the 4th floor and check behind me. Once I’m convinced Makise Kurisu’s not tailing me, I sigh while rubbing my temples.
Rintaro: "But I can’t let them capture me yet."
UNSPOKEN: Well then, what do I do now? My mission was to attend the conference and evaluate Doctor Nakabachi’s research. Now that I know he’s a fraud, there’s no real point in going back. I guess I’ll just go home. But wait. Aren’t I forgetting something important? Let’s see now... what is it?
Rintaro: "...Damn. I left Mayuri behind."
