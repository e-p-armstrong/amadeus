UNSPOKEN: The word I spoke impulsively a few seconds ago. I hesitate to speak it again. But I must. Because no matter how unbelievable it may be, we saw it with our own eyes! My head's full of question marks. I don't know how this happened. But if I were to explain it as I saw it... The banana that was inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change) returned instantly to its bunch. In other words...
Rintaro: A teleporter... we've invented a teleporter!
???: Oh?
UNSPOKEN: I hear a girl's voice coming from the lounge.
???: That looks like an interesting experiment.
Rintaro: Who's there!?
UNSPOKEN: My heart just skipped a beat. I turn towards the voice in surprise. And get pierced by a sharp stare.
Rintaro: Impossible! What are you doing here!? The 18-year-old genius girl! A sadist who humiliates men in public! Also known as The Zombie! Makise... Kurisu!
Itaru: Nice exposition, bro.
Kurisu: Who are you calling a zombie?
Rintaro: What is the meaning of this!? What is your purpose here?
Kurisu: I'm here to see you, Okabe Rintaro-san. Or is it Hououin Kyouma-san?
UNSPOKEN: Wait. How the hell does she know my real name? I've never spoken it in front of her!
Rintaro: I was right! You're one of the Organization's top agents, an esper with superhuman powers! No wonder you rose from the dead!
Kurisu: I'm not dead, alright? Please stop killing me off. Hashida-san, can you do something about this guy?
Itaru: You came at a bad time, Makise-shi, with Okarin freaking out like this.
UNSPOKEN: Daru doesn't seem phased by this girl's entrance. Why?
Rintaro: Have you betrayed me, Daru!?
Itaru: Calm down, man.
Rintaro: Are you being blackmailed? Or did she seduce you?
UNSPOKEN: I glare at Kurisu. He's my right-hand man! How dare you!?
Rintaro: YOU'VE CROSSED THE LINE, BIIITTCH!
Kurisu: Get ahold of yourself.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's eyes flash dangerously... I think. Such intensity from an 18-year-old. Maybe she didn't resurrect after her first death. Maybe she's a robotic killing machine, constructed to replace the dead Kurisu. Is that it? For now, I'll do as I'm told.
Kurisu: Hashida-san gave me the address after yesterday's lecture. He also told me your name.
UNSPOKEN: That's all? The truth is... kind of a let down.
Rintaro: So you're here to see me, is that it?
Kurisu: Yes. You claimed to have seen me die. I came to see if that was the truth, or just a pathetic excuse to grope me. I came for the answer.
UNSPOKEN: Now that she mentions it, she did treat me like I was a perv yesterday. Well... I suppose I should be grateful that she didn't call the cops on me after what I did. But what choice did I have? Anybody would react the same way if a dead person reappeared before them. Right?
Kurisu: But your current behavior is all the answer I need. It was all an act to grope me. My initial hypothesis was correct.
Rintaro: Not so fast. There's more to this than you know.
UNSPOKEN: I must clear my name, or I'll be labeled as a perv forever!
Kurisu: Anyway, let's put that aside for now.
Rintaro: R-really?
UNSPOKEN: That's a relief. I was sure she was going to call the police. But that for now part bothers me. Kurisu enters the development room with a quick, confident stride. Even though she's only 18, she's got a decent figure and good posture. Not much in the chest, though! Her presence seems to fill the cramped room, driving me and Daru to the corners. Can't she tell this area's off limits!?
Kurisu: I haven't properly introduced myself yet, have I? I'm Makise Kurisu. Pleased to meet you.
