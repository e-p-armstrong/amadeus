Mayuri: "Sounds like you, Okarin!"
UNSPOKEN: Woah, wasn’t expecting that from Mayuri.
Distant Voice: "AHHHHHHHHHHH!"
Rintaro: "!?"
UNSPOKEN: Wh-what was that?
Mayuri: "Was that a scream?"
UNSPOKEN: I think so... Only the presenter and a few other people are left in the assembly hall. Including Mayuri and me, less than half the audience remains. Everyone looks at each other anxiously, startled by the scream. Even I cannot suppress a shiver. First the explosion on the roof. Now this. What’s going on here? Mayuri squeezes my hand tight.
Rintaro: "Stay here, Mayuri!"
UNSPOKEN: I take a deep breath, prepare myself, and head in the direction of the scream. The echoes lead me down a dark, empty hallway on the same floor. I’m pretty sure it came from around that corner. I crouch down and turn the corner slowly, keeping my eyes and ears peeled for any sign of danger. And there, at the end of the passage, I see it. There’s something on the ground. No... someone. Motionless. Who is it? The clothes are familiar. ...It can’t be.
Rintaro: "Wha..."
UNSPOKEN: Makise Kurisu... Her face is turned away, but I know it’s her. The impertinent genius girl I just fought with ten minutes ago... ...is now face down in a pool of bright red blood. She’s dead.
Rintaro: "No... but... why?"
