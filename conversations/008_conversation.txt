Mayuri: What happened, Okarin?
Rintaro: W-we're leaving!
UNSPOKEN: I grab Mayuri's hand and run. I race down the stairs, trying to drive the image of Kurisu's dead body from my mind. But I can't. The redness of her blood is burned into my mind, more than the sight of the body itself. That was my first time seeing a dead body. Is this what it's like? When I realized that she was dead, I felt chilling terror and a surge of nausea.  But that was all I felt. Fear and disgust. Shouldn't there be something more? I guess I just didn't know her that well.
Rintaro: Haah, haah...
UNSPOKEN: I finally stop once we get out to the main street, Chuo-dori. My chest pounds, my breathing labored from running down the stairs at full speed.
Mayuri: Hey, what happened? You look really pale...
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri doesn't seem to comprehend the situation. I guess it's because she didn't see the body. She's not even breathing hard. She looks slow, but she's actually pretty fast on her feet.
Rintaro: Someone... died.
Mayuri: Eh...
