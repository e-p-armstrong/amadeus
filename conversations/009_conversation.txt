UNSPOKEN: What was that? Wait! Look around!
Rintaro: They're gone...
UNSPOKEN: Summer break. Noon. The busiest street in town. Just now, thousands of pedestrians vanished into thin air. Is this a dream? Am I hallucinating? I don't know. But they're gone. I saw them vanish with my own two eyes. I stand petrified, speechless, and alone on the empty street. Desperate to find someone, anyone, I look up. And there, at the top of Radi-Kan... Sticking out from the 8th floor event hall where we just were... Is a crashed satellite.
Rintaro: Hey, you. Can you see us? Why won't you answer? I'm asking you a question. Yes, you on the other side of the monitor. Hmph. Your silence only strengthens my hypothesis. I suppose that, from your perspective, it appears that we are the ones inside the monitor. Heh heh heh, but that's where you're wrong! For it is you who are inside! Your reality is nothing but lies and shadows. Naturally, that includes you, too. True reality is on this side of the screen. Don't believe me? I don't blame you. Few are those who can handle the truth. But no matter. I shall speak in simpler terms, easy enough for even you to understand. This is the Future Gadget Laboratory, located in the Akihabara district of Tokyo. We call it simply... the lab. Our purpose is to shatter the System and plunge the world into chaos.
Mayuri: Really? You shouldn't do bad things, Okarin.
Rintaro: Quiet. I'm a mad scientist, remember? From the station, head down Chuo-dori until you reach Suehirocho Station, then take a left onto Kuramaebashi-dori. In the alley before the traffic light, you'll find the run-down Ohiyama Building. The lab is on the second floor. On the first floor is a store of ill repute called the Braun Tube Workshop. You can't miss it. It deals exclusively in CRT monitors, of all things. Can you imagine? Even in the heart of Akihabara's Electric Town, the demand for CRTs is practically nonexistent. But the proprietor of the Braun Tube Workshop, Tennouji, is also the owner of the building. That's how he can afford to maintain his ridiculously niche hobby shop even as land value continues to rise. He may seem a rough sort, but he was no match for my charisma. Now the entire second floor is mine for next to nothing. Muhahaha! I digress. The Future Gadget Laboratory is currently experiencing a severe shortage of manpower. We welcome dedicated scientists from all fields to apply. At present, our researchers are--
Mayuri: Okarin, Okarin. You've gotta say 'lab mems', not researchers.
Rintaro: ...Our lab mems -- laboratory members -- are three! I am the founder of the Future Gadget Lab, Lab Mem Number 001, the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!
