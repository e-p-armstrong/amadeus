Rintaro: "Next, we have our resident cosplayer and only female member, Lab Mem Number 002, Shiina Mayuri."
Mayuri: "Tutturu♪ Call me Mayushii! I like making costumes more than wearing them."
Rintaro: "And last, we have our resident super hacka, Lab Mem Number 003, Hashida Itaru."
Itaru: "Stop calling me that! It’s super hacker, duh."
Rintaro: "Here at the Future Gadget Laboratory, we devote ourselves to the art of invention! For details, see our lab’s homepage. Our top priority, of course, is to develop weapons for the war with the Dark Dominion, but that research has spawned a number of offshoot inventions. In fact, that’s all it’s spawned. Our arsenal of Future Gadgets is up to eight, but this is just the beginning. I have a total of 108 inventions to create!"
Itaru: "Like in that tennis manga, right? I get it."
Rintaro: "No! It’s the number of earthly desires in mortals, you @channel junkie. And I thought I told you not interrupt me when I’m talking!"
Itaru: "Yeah, wouldn’t want to interrupt you talking to yourself."
Rintaro: "I’m not talking to myself. Can’t you see? I’m talking to the person behind the monitor."
Mayuri: "Ah, he just grinned!"
Rintaro: "What are you grinning about, damn you!? You don’t even exist outside that monitor!"
Itaru: "Just say ’don’t look at me’."
Mayuri: "I don’t think that’s gonna work..."
Rintaro: "It appears our attempts to communicate have failed. It’s sad to see someone so deeply in denial of reality."
Mayuri: "Maybe they think we’re in the game?"
Itaru: "I doubt it’s even occurred to them."
Mayuri: "But aren’t your 2D girlfriends the same way?"
Itaru: "That’s different. Those girls are my wives."
Rintaro: "Nobody cares about your harem."
Itaru: "But Mayushii touched upon a very interesting theme, ya know? What if we’re actually just characters in a game? Any way we can know for sure?"
Rintaro: "No."
Itaru: "Come on!"
Rintaro: "Such questions are meaningless. Our time is better spent thinking of ways to destroy the System."
Itaru: "Nice chuunibyou, bro."
UNSPOKEN: I step back from the monitor. Displayed on the screen is the uglycute character Alpacaman. This is a game called ’Alpacaman 2’, where you speak to Alpacaman via microphone and watch him react. The game exploded in popularity when it was released 10 years ago, but personally, I find only the ugly part of uglycute to be true. I bought it yesterday. 500 yen used. Headset included. I turn to Daru with a menacing glare.
Rintaro: "Shut it, hacka. I’m no chuunibyou patient."
UNSPOKEN: I sweep my hair back and flash a devilish grin.
Rintaro: "I am Hououin... Kyouma!"
Itaru: "That’s your character’s name, right?"
Rintaro: "Oh Daru... your communication skills are beyond repair."
