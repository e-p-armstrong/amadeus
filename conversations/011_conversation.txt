UNSPOKEN: Over here, nursing a pricked finger, we have Shiina Mayuri. A 16-year-old high school student, if you can believe it. I've known her since we were both small. She's also an otaku. Nowhere near Daru's level, though. This ditzy girl is in charge of the lab's official Costume Division (for Women), and today she's working on costumes at her usual leisurely pace. Why does the Future Gadget Laboratory need costumes (for women)? It doesn't. The truth is that Mayuri is completely useless. Still, there's no way I would ever kick her out. After all, she was the first one to join the Future Gadget Laboratory. I still remember the day Mayuri first came to the lab. It was spring. She said to me:
Mayuri: Mayushii is Okarin's hostage! I belong here!
UNSPOKEN: Well, that certainly was cryptic. But her offer was my salvation. For she was the first to join me on my magnificent quest. She saved me from a solitary life on the run from the Organization. I will never forget her kindness. Mayuri doesn't have to be useful. Her being here is enough.
Itaru: So, did Alpacaman say anything?
Rintaro: Nope. Nothing.
UNSPOKEN: The human-faced alpaca inside the monitor was completely unresponsive. So unresponsive you'd think the game was bugged. Whatever, I give up. Never again will I play this boring game.
Rintaro: Damn antisocial alpaca!
UNSPOKEN: I curse his name and smack the TV. As soon as I do--
Rintaro: Hm?
UNSPOKEN: The TV makes a sound like it shorted, and then the screen goes blank. I change the channel... Nothing. Check the power cable... Nothing. Whack it again... Nothing. I guess it's broken. Damn. This crummy TV is on lease from the Braun Tube Workshop downstairs. It's probably just old.
Mayuri: You made Mr. Alpaca angry!
Rintaro: Damn. I'll have to get it repaired later.
UNSPOKEN: I turn off the TV and lie down on the couch. I'm fed up with the humidity of Japanese summers. I stare at a conspicuous stain on the ceiling while fanning myself. I close my eyes. And what naturally comes to mind is that impossible scene I saw an hour ago.
Rintaro: They're gone...
UNSPOKEN: As I left Radi-Kan, everyone vanished before my eyes. I can't explain it. And it wasn't just the people on the street. The people in the stores, gone. In the restaurants, gone. Even the cars vanished, drivers and all. And it all happened in the blink of an eye. Suddenly, an empty city spread before me. I could still hear the music from the stores, but those catchy melodies were the only sounds of life remaining. Heat was rising from the asphalt in waves, but I felt only a cold chill down my spine. I just stood there, breathless, until--
Mayuri: What's wrong?
