Mayuri: Huh?
Rintaro: You saw it too, right!? Just now, before our very eyes!
UNSPOKEN: Panic took hold as the enormity of what had just happened struck me. Unable to control myself, I grabbed Mayuri by her slender shoulders and shook her.
Rintaro: Did you see it, Mayuri!? You saw it, right!?
Mayuri: Hmmm? Huhhhhh?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri's head flopped back and forth from my shaking.
Mayuri: IIIII diiiiidn't seeeee anythiiiiing!
Rintaro: You... didn't?
UNSPOKEN: I stopped shaking her and looked straight into her eyes. She returned my gaze with eyes clear as glass marbles.
Rintaro: You saw nothing? Nothing at all!? There were people here a second ago, weren't there!?
Mayuri: ...There were?
Rintaro: Even the store employees are gone! That's impossible by any measure!
Mayuri: Of course they are...
UNSPOKEN: Her reply didn't make any sense.
Mayuri: It was like this when we got here. Oh, I know! You're seeing things, aren't you? I'm sure it's 'cause of the heat! Tutturuâ™ª
UNSPOKEN: How could she laugh at a time like this? I always thought she was a bit strange, but maybe her brain is actually broken. I realized that she couldn't help me. With nowhere else to turn, I looked up at the bright blue sky. There wasn't a cloud in sight. The scorching summer sun shone bright through the gaps between Akiba's buildings. Naturally, my eyes drifted to the top floor of Radi-Kan, where I had been just a moment before. There it was. An enormous machine, like some kind of satellite, embedded in the roof of the building where, not five minutes before, I had found Makise Kurisu's body in a pool of blood. What happened to her? Just before everyone disappeared, I could've sworn I heard an ambulance siren. Makise Kurisu might still be in that dark, narrow passageway -- cold, bloody, and alone. The thought disturbed me, but the question at the forefront of my mind was...
Rintaro: ...What the hell is that satellite doing there?
UNSPOKEN: Right before Doctor Nakabachi's presentation, the building shook like a bomb had exploded. The roof door lock had been broken, and beyond it someone had placed a satellite-like machine, shrouded in smoke and glowing dust. When I first saw it, the satellite was on the rooftop. But that's not what I was seeing now. This satellite had penetrated the top floor of the building, obliterating the room where Doctor Nakabachi's press conference had been held. It must have fallen out of orbit without burning up in the atmosphere, somehow. I knew it was crazy, but what other explanation could there be? The real question was... When did that happen?
Rintaro: Mayuri, about that satellite...
Mayuri: Yup. What a surprise, huh?
Rintaro: What do you mean? What was a surprise?
Mayuri: It made a huge 'kaplow' sound!
