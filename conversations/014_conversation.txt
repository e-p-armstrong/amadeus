Rintaro: "Ah, elixir intellectualis, a drink fit for a genius!"
Itaru: "Cola’s better."
Mayuri: "Okarin really loves his Dr P!"
Rintaro: "I pity the man who knows not the greatness of this beverage! Muhahaha!"
UNSPOKEN: Step through the curtain dividing its center, and you’ll enter the heart of the Future Gadget Laboratory: the development room. Just as the name implies, this is the room where we develop Future Gadgets. Needless to say, it is strictly off-limits to outsiders. Yes, I know the setup is cheap -- I would much rather have an airlock than a curtain -- but our research budget is already scraping the bottom of the barrel. Besides, what’s important isn’t money. It’s ambition. I poke Daru and bid him follow me into the development room. All of the windows here are weather stripped with packing tape, so it’s dim. And hot, almost like a sauna. I’ve been wanting to buy an air conditioner for the lab, but there’s no money for that. We’re currently accepting donations. Upon entering the development room, I pick up the lab coat that’s lazily draped on the chair and put it on. I always wear a lab coat in the development room. For practical reasons as well as symbolic ones. Daru, however, refuses to wear his. Putting it on and taking it off is apparently too much trouble for him. He can’t be bothered to do anything that doesn’t interest him. It’s men like him who give our generation a bad name. His lab coat (purchased from my own pocket money, I might add) just sits on the shelf. It’s never been worn and probably never will be.
Rintaro: "Daru. Is the plan progressing smoothly?"
Itaru: "Uh, what plan?"
UNSPOKEN: Daru gives me a blank look. I sigh and turn his attention to the table in the middle of the room. Sitting majestically on top of the table is a commercial-grade microwave oven. It’s significantly larger than newer home models.
Rintaro: "The plan, as in the plan. Obviously, I’m talking about perfecting Gadget No. 8."
Itaru: "Oh, that. How was I supposed to know what you meant?"
Rintaro: "We’ve known each other for what, three years now?"
UNSPOKEN: We went to high school together. And now, we’re going to the same university. We share an inseparable bond, like prison cellmates. He’s only been a lab member for two months, though.
Itaru: "We were in different classes junior year, and actually we didn’t talk at all. So two years?"
Rintaro: "Details. The point is we’ve known each other a long time. I expect you to keep up with me here."
Itaru: "N O P E"
UNSPOKEN: Awkward silence. Man. All I wanted to do was have one of those cool cryptic conversations where we talk about plans and preparations and other important-sounding stuff but no one knows what it means except us. Shot down again.
Rintaro: "So, are we any closer to figuring out what’s wrong with Gadget No. 8?"
