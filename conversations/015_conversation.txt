UNSPOKEN: Daru, now looking completely fed up with the heat, starts fanning himself with his shirt. I know what he means by really weird. Let's see if we can't make it happen again.
Rintaro: Mayuri! Mayuri! Bring forth the bananas!
Mayuri: Are you gonna turn them into gelbanas again?
Itaru: That's been bugging me, Mayu-shi. Can you stop calling them 'gelbanas'?
Mayuri: But gelbanas are gelbanas.
UNSPOKEN: I take the bananas from Mayuri and stick the whole bunch into the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Mayuri: Why do you have to use the whole bunch? It's a waste of food.
Rintaro: Your stinginess could cost us the battle with the Organization!
Mayuri: That's fine with me. Mayushii always buys the bananas, and now Mayushii can't eat a single one.
Rintaro: Next time, we'll only do one banana.
UNSPOKEN: But I already put the whole bunch in, so I ignore her hungry complaints. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is simple to use. It's a microwave with a phone taped on. The number is already in my address book. I just need to call the PhoneWave. Now, where did I put my phone... I check my pants and coat pockets. I'm connected.
Guidance: Hello. This is the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
UNSPOKEN: This is the voice of Mayushii Guidance, the system Daru programmed to operate the phonewave.
Mayuri: Do you hear Mayushii's voice?
Rintaro: Be quiet. I'm trying to listen.
Guidance: You can operate the timer from this menu. After pushing the # button, please enter the heating time in seconds. For example, press '#60' for one minute. For two minutes, press '#120'.
UNSPOKEN: Entering the command properly will cause the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to function like a normal microwave. Instead, we're going to deliberately mess up and enter 120#. When I enter the command, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) starts up with a low hum.
Itaru: Won't this just warm it normally?
UNSPOKEN: Crap, I messed up! I immediately shut it off. Let's try again. This time, we're going to ignore the guidance and enter 120#. Crap, I messed up. Let's start over. I need to ignore the guidance and enter 120#. That should do it. This method was originally a simple mistake on Mayuri's part, but it somehow starts the freezing process. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) comes to life. The turntable begins to rotate.
Itaru: Nice turntable, right? It's even spinning backwards.
Rintaro: Backwards!?
UNSPOKEN: I never noticed that!
Rintaro: That might have serious implications! If we look at quantum critical behavior driven by Hund's rule--
Itaru: Yeah! No.
Rintaro: ...not Hund's Rule?
Itaru: No.
Rintaro: ...okay.
UNSPOKEN: The three of us wait and stare at the spinning bananas. After 120 seconds pass, the microwave chimes. Mayuri takes the bananas out.
Mayuri: Gelbanas are ready!
