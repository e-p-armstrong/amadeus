Itaru: "...They look really nasty."
Rintaro: "The taste doesn’t matter. What matters is that you eat it! So come on, Daru, no need to be shy. Break a leg, or a stomach, and go for it!"
Itaru: "No way."
Rintaro: "...Fine. Mayuri! The honor shall be yours."
Mayuri: "But gelbanas are all gloopy, droopy, soft, and squishy."
UNSPOKEN: Wait, she already tried one?
Mayuri: "It had no flavor and wasn’t tasty at all..."
Rintaro: "Gloopy, droopy, soft and squishy... Daru, what do you think?"
Itaru: "Soft and squishy bananas, huh... Soft and squishy... banana... Mayu-shi, say ’your banana’s all soft and squishy’ for me."
Mayuri: "Daru-kun, your nose is bleeding."
Itaru: "Please just say it!"
Mayuri: "Your banana’s all soft and--"
Rintaro: "Don’t make her say that, you perv!"
UNSPOKEN: Daru retreats after I hit him with a tissue box. Mayuri looks at us with an innocent smile. She doesn’t get it, obviously. Anyway.
Rintaro: "They’re gelatinous, a semi-solid state of matter. In other words, there is a possibility that the intermolecular bonds were weakened."
UNSPOKEN: What could have partially liquified the bananas...
Rintaro: "I’ve got it!"
UNSPOKEN: I turn to the whiteboard and write FREEZING in the middle. Then, I cross it out and slap the board with my hand.
Rintaro: "What we thought was a freezing function is actually something else!"
UNSPOKEN: A bold statement, if I do say so myself. ...So why isn’t anyone surprised?
Rintaro: "Now’s the time to shout, ’W-what you say!?’ Come on, don’t be shy!"
UNSPOKEN: Their reactions are pathetically weak. Mayuri probably didn’t even understand half of what I said...
Itaru: "Uh, we already knew that."
UNSPOKEN: ...Oh.
Itaru: "The problem is we don’t know what it is doing, or why it’s doing it."
Mayuri: "If it’s the opposite of freezing, then couldn’t it be thawing them?"
Rintaro: "What a silly question, Mayuri. What you’re describing is just a normal microwave!"
Mayuri: "Then, what is it?"
Itaru: "We don’t know, and that’s the problem."
