Rintaro: "Daru, aren’t you going to check out Radi-Kan?"
Itaru: "No point. Can’t get close. I’ve been following the news online, though. There’s already a hundred threads about it on @channel. It’s huge, man."
UNSPOKEN: Oh, so that’s why he was staring at his phone earlier. We enter Daibiru and take the elevator to the 5th floor ATF assembly hall.
Itaru: "Man, feel that AC! I’m alive!"
UNSPOKEN: Unlike the lab, Daibiru has air conditioning. Yet another reason for our diligent participation in the seminar.
Rintaro: "About the PhoneWave (name subject to change). I might have found our answer."
Itaru: "You know, that ’(name subject to change)’ thing is really annoying."
UNSPOKEN: I won’t give in that easily. Even if no other lab members use ’(name subject to change)’, I will carry on until the day we decide its true name.
Rintaro: "Now’s not the time."
Itaru: "So, what’s your latest ridiculous theory?"
Rintaro: "What do you mean, ridiculous? My genius brain considers every possibility, even those a lesser mind would say break the laws of nature. Don’t you dare call that ridiculous."
Itaru: "So basically, you’re just pulling stuff outta your ass. You can’t call that science."
Rintaro: "Daru. I have a hunch that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) may be the key to opening Steins Gate. How’s that?"
Itaru: "Steins what? You lost me back at ’ridiculous’, man."
UNSPOKEN: A chime signals our arrival on the 5th floor. The elevator doors open slowly. As we step out of the elevator--
Kurisu: "Ah!"
UNSPOKEN: I bump into someone. I quickly grab the person’s shoulder to keep them from falling.
Kurisu: "I’m sorry!"
Rintaro: "Wha...!?"
UNSPOKEN: It’s a girl. And I recognize her.
Rintaro: "You... you...!"
UNSPOKEN: Impossible. Chills run down my spine. I stare at her face in disbelief. I saw this girl just three hours ago. Makise Kurisu!
Kurisu: "Is there something wrong?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu frowns and tries to back away. But I don’t let go of her shoulder. My grip tightens.
Kurisu: "O-ow!"
Rintaro: "Y-you... You should be dead! Why are you here!? And you’re even..."
UNSPOKEN: There isn’t a single bloodstain on her clothes, and they’re the same ones she was wearing when I found her. Only a serious wound could have produced that much blood. Yet as far as I can tell, she’s completely uninjured.
Rintaro: "Not a scratch..."
Kurisu: "Hey, that hurts! Let me go!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu pushes me away. Then she shoots me a wary glare. I realize that I’m gaping in disbelief.
Kurisu: "What’s wrong with you?"
Rintaro: "You’re okay? But that’s impossible! Someone stabbed you! I saw you lying in a pool of blood!"
Itaru: "That again?"
UNSPOKEN: Daru interrupts. Wait. There’s something strange about what he just said.
Rintaro: "What do you mean, ’again’?"
