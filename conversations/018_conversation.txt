Rintaro: "I sent you an email? Don’t be ridiculous! I saw her dead just three hours ago!"
Kurisu: "Hey! Could you not talk about me like that? I’m perfectly fine."
Itaru: "You know, that message was kinda weird. It was dated a week after I got it, which means it came from the future."
Kurisu: "It came from the future?"
Rintaro: "That sounds like something you’d read on the internet, Daru. It’s rare for you to talk about ridiculous theories."
Itaru: "No, the date was definitely a week later. It came from, uh... the 28th. Wait. That’s today!"
UNSPOKEN: Daru pulls out his phone and shows it to me. He’s right. The email was sent from my phone. He received it on July 21st at 12:56. But it was sent on July 28th at 12:54. It was split into three mails. Someone stab bed Makise K urisu. Don’t Why did I send such a short message in three parts? And it looks like the third email got cut off. I do recognize the content, though.
Rintaro: "This is the email I sent you three hours ago."
UNSPOKEN: But I sent one mail. Not three. And there should be more text. Did Daru really get this a week ago?
Kurisu: "Interesting..."
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Kurisu is standing next to me, peering intently at the screen of Daru’s phone. Oh, right! The email’s not important! Well, maybe it is, but not right now! The real question is why she’s still alive! Is she an illusion!? No, an evil spirit!? Am I haunted!? I don’t believe in such unscientific drivel! I am a mad scientist! I timidly reach out to Kurisu’s face... My fingertips stroke her hair. Feels silky. Quite the cuticles.
Rintaro: "Substance. She has substance. Of course she’s not a ghost. How silly of me."
Itaru: "O-Okarin, I don’t think that’s a good idea..."
UNSPOKEN: I poke Kurisu’s cheeks with my fingers. Such softness. Dead bodies don’t feel like this. Not that I’ve ever touched one.
Kurisu: "...Hey."
UNSPOKEN: Wait a minute, we already touched when I bumped into her coming out of the elevator. I even grabbed her shoulders before being pushed away. And I still doubted that she had substance? That’s just proof of how confused I am. If she’s alive, then what did I see back at Radi-Kan? What was that scream I heard? Were they hallucinations, just like that mass disappearance? That’s right, she was stabbed! Maybe she’s just hiding her wounds. This requires further investigation. I grab the hem of her blouse and slowly lift it--
Kurisu: "Are you trying to get yourself arrested?"
Rintaro: "I just want to know the truth."
UNSPOKEN: I stare straight back at Kurisu as she trembles with anger, and lift her blouse a little higher...
Kurisu: "What truth, you perv!? You stupid!? Wanna die!?"
