Kurisu: Hello? Can you put your phone away when you're talking with someone?
Rintaro: Don't be like that. Rather, you should praise me, for I have taught a foul mail demon to behave like a civilized human being.
Kurisu: Why are you so pompous?
Rintaro: I'd ask you the same thing, Christina.
UNSPOKEN: Okay, let's send a reply. Apology accepted. I'm looking for an IBN 5100 too. I agree that we should exchange information. I'll let you know when I have something. You don't need to reply to this mail. I type that out and send it.
Kurisu: Are you done with your little mail exchange? Hououin-san?
Rintaro: Oh? So you remember my true name. Indeed, I am Hououin Kyouma.
Kurisu: I was being facetious.
Rintaro: How was that facetious? You called me by my correct name. You made no mistake. You'll make a good assistant.
Kurisu: Okabe-san... have you sought professional help?
Rintaro: I am not Okabe!
Kurisu: This is exhausting...
UNSPOKEN: Let's save checking the email for later.
Kurisu: You're pompous, but at least you have some manners.
Rintaro: What do you mean?
Kurisu: I hate people who play with their phones in the middle of a conversation.
Rintaro: Ah, so that's why you grabbed my phone when we first met.
Kurisu: When we first met? I didn't do that.
Rintaro: Yeah you did. There I was, giving my report, when you grabbed my--
UNSPOKEN: ...phone out of my hand. I shut my mouth before I finish. The events at Radi-Kan. My story of what happened back then doesn't mesh with Daru's story. It didn't mesh with Mayuri's. And now it won't mesh Kurisu's. So in the end, was that a dream? A hallucination?
Kurisu: What? What do you mean 'giving your report'?
Rintaro: No. It's nothing. So, about the PhoneWave (name subject to change). After the experiment, you screamed something like 'A time machine? It can't be!' Did something awaken a past trauma?
Kurisu: No. And don't go making one up either.
Rintaro: Back when she was five years old, Christina was on the plains of Arkansas when lightning--
Kurisu: I wasn't hit by lightning! And I was still living in Japan when I was five! And why Arkansas?
Rintaro: I was trying to imagine tranquil scenery, and the first state to come to mind was Arkansas. Second was Oregon.
Kurisu: Not Utah? I mean, relatively speaking, isn't Utah more suitable?
Rintaro: Then answer me, Christina! Why did you freak out back then!?
Kurisu: ...No reason. I simply didn't want to believe. Fringe science should stay in the realm of fiction.
Rintaro: Fringe science? Don't be ridiculous. You saw it with your own eyes. You saw the email leap to the past! You saw the banana travel instantly through space!
Kurisu: I saw... but we must be missing something. Or maybe we're just seeing what we want to see. Remember what I said at ATF? Time machines are just a pipe dream given modern technology. And yet a bunch of amateurs like you just stick a phone and a microwave together and expect time travel to occur? Ridiculous.
Rintaro: But it did occur! Will you deny what you saw with your own eyes? Are you saying that theories trump reality? Then I hope you enjoy sophistry and word games, because that's all you'll ever have!
Kurisu: What do you mean, word games?
Rintaro: Quantum theory, for example. If you ask me, theories like that are nothing but word games!
Kurisu: Wait, are you rejecting modern physics? Who do you think you are?
Rintaro: Trust what you see! The only things that matter are things that happen; things that don't happen, things that aren't observed, are just hypotheses!
Kurisu: When hypotheses pile up, and theories are verified, they become reality. That's how modern physics comes to understand the truth of the universe.
