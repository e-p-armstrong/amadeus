Itaru: Okarin, you magnificent fool!
UNSPOKEN: Sitting at my side, Daru throws me a small salute. ATF staff are approaching, probably to kick me out. Perhaps I got too carried away.
Kurisu: Um... okay. It's fine, I guess. It'll be easier to talk in a discussion format.
UNSPOKEN: Thanks to her proposal, the event staff refrain from escorting me out. She sounds a little pissed, but let's not mind that.
Kurisu: But before that, please listen to my thoughts on the subject. Scientists have proposed many theoretical models of time travel, but there are eleven in particular that bear mentioning.
UNSPOKEN: Hmm... what are the major theories of time travel? I have heard about the cosmic string theory, at least.
Kurisu: Neutron Star Theory. Black Hole Theory. Lightspeed Theory. Tachyon Theory. Wormhole Theory. Exotic Matter Theory. Cosmic String Theory. Quantum Gravity Theory. Cesium Laser Theory. Elementary Particle Ring & Laser Theory. Dirac Antiparticle Theory.
UNSPOKEN: Hmm... not bad. Perhaps Makise Kurisu is a worthy rival after all.
Kurisu: However, all of these models are purely theoretical. Some of them even contradict each other.
Rintaro: Well, what if someone comes up with a 12th model?
Kurisu: Hm? Ahh, uhh, right, well... It could be contradicted by the 13th model, now couldn't it?
UNSPOKEN: Damn! She twisted my question and used it against me! Touche, genius girl. Suddenly, I feel eyes on me. Some puffed-up professors are giving me hard looks from across the room. Maybe I got too carried away. I don't want to risk losing my credits. I should back off for now.
Kurisu: By the way, time travel to the future is available to us right now, according to Einstein's special theory of relativity. For example, let's say someone were to go to Haneda Airport and board a plane headed to Okinawa. Upon arrival, that person would be about one hundred millionth of a second farther into the future than I am.
UNSPOKEN: What does that mean?
Kurisu: According to the special theory of relativity, time moves slower for objects as they approach the speed of light. For example, if you could run at near the speed of light, you could reach a point where time only moves half as fast for you. If you were to keep running at that speed for 24 hours, 48 hours would elapse in the rest of the world, meaning you would 'jump' one day into the future. Understand, Hououin Kyouma?
Rintaro: Gah!
