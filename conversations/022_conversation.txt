Kurisu: Hey. What are you two talking about?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako finally notices Kurisu and gives me a puzzled look.
Luka: Um... who might this be?
Rintaro: My assistant.
Kurisu: No! What kind of introduction is that!?
Rintaro: I'm only telling the truth, Christina.
Luka: You're n-not Japanese?
Kurisu: I am Japanese.
Rintaro: Anyway, Lukako. I need to talk to your father about--
Kurisu: Wait! Introduce me properly!
Rintaro: You want to be introduced? Properly?
Kurisu: It's unnatural not to be introduced in this situation!
Rintaro: I didn't come here to introduce you to Lukako!
Kurisu: An introduction wouldn't take more than ten seconds! What's wrong with you?
Luka: Um... please don't fight...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako's flustered. Looks like he thinks we're fighting.
Rintaro: This is Makise Kurisu. My assistant.
Kurisu: Yeah, whatever. Assistant, whatever... sigh.
Luka: Nice to meet you, Makise-san. I'm Urushibara L-Luka.
Kurisu: Nice to meet you too. How old are you?
Luka: 17 this year.
Kurisu: A year younger than me...
Luka: Oh, really? Makise-san, you're so grown up, I can't believe we're only a year apart.
Rintaro: That means you look old.
UNSPOKEN: She glares at me.
Luka: No, that's not what I... um, I mean you're very beautiful!
Kurisu: Thanks. I think you're very cute.
UNSPOKEN: But he's a guy. I probably shouldn't tell her that. The shock from learning the truth might be enough to make her go back to America.
Rintaro: You're introduced. Happy? Can we move on now?
Kurisu: You are such a jerk.
Rintaro: Anyway, Lukako, I require an audience with your father. Can you make it happen?
Luka: Yes, sure, but why do you need to talk to my dad?
Rintaro: It's a grave matter that concerns the future of mankind.
Luka: The future...
Kurisu: Of mankind?
Luka: I'll go get him!
UNSPOKEN: Lukako races into the shrine office. He believes just about everything I say. He's really easy to deal with, unlike my rebellious assistant.
Kurisu: Achoo! Oh no, did I catch a cold?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's sniffling should keep her too occupied to scold me for awhile. Lukako's father soon appears. Lukako is pretty flustered. He's practically dragging his father behind him.
Luka: Hurry, Dad! Hurry!
Luka’s Father: Slow down a little. If you rush me, I'm going to fall.
Luka: But the future of mankind is at stake!
Luka’s Father: Oh. Well. That's certainly serious.
UNSPOKEN: I've met Lukako's father several times before. He's a gentle, respectable adult. With the exception of how he raised Lukako. Apparently, the reason Lukako wears miko garb is because his father requested it. Maybe his dad's a pervert. No, it's not like I mean to mock the Shinto priesthood or anything like that.
Luka’s Father: Ah, Hououin-kun. It's been a while. Thank you for always taking care of Luka.
Rintaro: The honor is mine.
Kurisu: ...His name isn't Hououin. It's Okabe.
Luka’s Father: Oh. Really?
Rintaro: You there, assistant! Stop making things complicated!
Kurisu: I'm just telling the truth.
UNSPOKEN: Tch, what did she come here for?
Luka’s Father: Luka told me his name was Hououin. Hmm, maybe Luka was just playing a trick on me. Hahaha.
Luka: Th-that's not it, Dad. Okabe-san is his real name, and Hououin is, umm...
Rintaro: I am Hououin.
Kurisu: Okabe Rintaro is the name your parents gave you, right? Are you denying that?
Rintaro: Just be quiet, Zombie!
Kurisu: Who's a zombie!?
Luka’s Father: Hahaha. It's great that you all get along.
UNSPOKEN: Luka's dad looks at Kurisu.
Luka’s Father: Are you one of Luka's friends too? Please get along with Luka from now on too.
Kurisu: Um, I'm...
