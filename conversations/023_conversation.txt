Kurisu: The time paradox of time paradoxes. In other words, the Grandfather Paradox.
UNSPOKEN: Oh, that thing where you kill your own ancestors before you were born?
Kurisu: As long as this paradox goes unsolved, time travel can never be realized. Never.
Student: What if you just don't kill them?
Kurisu: You can't think of it like a sci-fi movie. It's not just about your family tree. There are far greater dangers than that.
UNSPOKEN: Really? It doesn't seem that dangerous.
Kurisu: Any paradox, no matter how small, would cause the total collapse of causality, relativity, and every other physical law in existence. Paradoxes are nothing more than thought experiments. They cannot occur in reality, and they should not. Nothing that has even a 0. 000001% chance of causing a paradox can happen. The universe won't allow it. Wouldn't you say this is the logical conclusion? There may be loopholes, like parallel worlds or the self-consistency principle, but those seem too much like fantasy for me to accept.
Rintaro: Gah...
