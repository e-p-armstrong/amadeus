UNSPOKEN: There are two girls standing in front of the main building. One of them is Mayuri. The other is a docile-looking beauty in traditional miko attire. Urushibara Luka. A stunning example of feminine charm and grace. Lips delicate like cherry blossoms in bloom. The essence of Japanese beauty. The chief priest’s son. That’s right, son. Lovely in every way... but he’s a guy.
Luka: "Good afternoon, Okabe-san."
UNSPOKEN: He bows his head. The voice of a girl. The mannerisms of girl. More feminine than any girl I know. But he’s a guy. Taller than Mayuri. Yet oh so slender. But he’s a guy. Looks stunning in miko robes. But he’s a guy. Holding a bamboo broom. Apparently in the middle of cleaning. But he’s a guy. It’s almost evening, yet still hot as hell outside. But he’s a guy. Damn cicadas won’t shut up. But he’s a guy.
Rintaro: "Lukako. That blade I gave you, what happened to it?"
UNSPOKEN: He’s a friend of mine. I call him Lukako. We met when I rescued him from some aggressive photographers in Akiba’s Pedestrian Heaven. It also so happens that Lukako and Mayuri are classmates. I learned that fact after I had gotten to know him. Lukako is taken aback by my sharp question. He starts fidgeting with a flushed face and tears in his eyes.
Luka: "Um, you mean... Demon Sword Samidare?"
Rintaro: "Correct. I bought it for you so you could learn to control your power."
Mayuri: "Oh yeah! You bought it at BladeWorks, right? I think you said it cost 980--"
Rintaro: "Don’t say another word! Any more and they will come to silence you!"
Mayuri: "They’re gonna silence me? Thanks for worrying about me, Okarin. But who are they?"
UNSPOKEN: I ignore Mayuri’s question.
Rintaro: "So, Lukako. Are you making sure to practice with Samidare like I told you?"
Luka: "Y-yes, I do practice swings once a day..."
Rintaro: "As long as you carry it and master the Seishin Zanma school of swordsmanship, you can prevent the dark flame inside you from consuming your soul."
UNSPOKEN: Demon Sword Samidare may be an imitation sword, but that is only the form it takes to hide from the world. When one worthy to wield it appears, it unleashes its true power. And it was on sale for only 980 yen (tax included).
Luka: "Thank you, Okabe-san. It was a wonderful present."
Rintaro: "My name isn’t Okabe."
Mayuri: "It’s Okarin!"
Luka: "I’m sorry, Kyouma-san."
Rintaro: "As long as you understand. Now, speak the words."
Luka: "Ah, umm. El... Psy... Kongaloo...?"
Rintaro: "No! Not Kongaloo! Kongroo!"
Luka: "Y-yes! El... Psy... Kongroo. D-did I get it right?"
