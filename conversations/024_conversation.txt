Kurisu: Pathetic. It's only as big as a CRT monitor.
Rintaro: Then why don't you try carrying it? Then you'll understand.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu sighs, grabs both ends of the cardboard box, and lifts.
Kurisu: Wheugh...!
UNSPOKEN: She strains with all her might, but gives up without lifting it even a centimeter.
Kurisu: ...It's r-really heavy.
UNSPOKEN: She blushes slightly, but still maintains her usual frown. My assistant seems to have a strong competitive spirit.
Kurisu: This thing's gotta weigh like 30 kilos. Maybe we should've borrowed a push cart. Urushibara-san, is there one in the shrine?
Luka: Umm, there is one, but actually, it's broken... I'm sorry.
Kurisu: Oh. Is there some other place we could borrow--
Rintaro: No, we don't need a push cart.
Kurisu: Then how are you going to bring it back? It takes about ten minutes to walk to your run-down lab from here.
Rintaro: It may be too heavy for one person, but it's a different story for two. You and I just need to carry it together. Why else do you think I made you my assistant?
Kurisu: So that's why... Well, if we carry it together, we might be able to manage, but... But I refuse.
Rintaro: ...huh?
Kurisu: I... I said 'no!'
Rintaro: I'm pretty sure you said 'but I refuse.'
Kurisu: Sh-shut up. I said no.
UNSPOKEN: But I refuse is a famous manga quote. Could Kurisu be an @channeler?
Kurisu: The whole reason you made me a lab mem was to 'borrow my knowledge'. From this, it is elementary to derive the following: 'I won't do physical labor.'
Rintaro: I see. Then I guess I have no choice. I'll do my best to carry it, but...
UNSPOKEN: I glance at Lukako. He twitches when he notices my look, then timidly raises his hand with tears in his eyes.
Luka: Um, th-then, I will...
Kurisu: Eh? You're going to help? Will you be okay?
Luka: Yes, I'll d-do my best.
Rintaro: No, Lukako. I shouldn't make you help me. I can manage by myself.
Luka: But... we're friends, Okabe-san. I want to help you.
Rintaro: No, I'll do it myself.
Luka: I-I'll help you!
Kurisu: Th-then, umm... me too...
Rintaro: Please, go ahead.
Kurisu: Eh? Wha!?
Rintaro: Muhahaha! Don't you know, Christina? This is what you call a Japanese Gag!
Kurisu: You sneaky...
Rintaro: Thanks for the backup, Lukako! Now that that's settled, my assistant will help me carry the computer, so you don't have to help. Thanks for the offer.
Luka: Ah, okay... if that's how it is, then...
Rintaro: Now, assistant! Since you volunteered, I won't let you refuse. Grab hold and heave!
Kurisu: ...Fine.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu and I lift up the cardboard box. The burden's considerably easier when distributed between two people.
Kurisu: Why do we have to be face to face?
UNSPOKEN: We're positioned so that we're looking at each other. But there's no other way to hold it, so what can you do?
Rintaro: Let's just go.
UNSPOKEN: I start to walk out of the shrine.
Kurisu: Hey! Stop stop stop! I said stop!
Rintaro: You're a noisy one.
Kurisu: Don't walk forwards. Then I have to walk backwards. Let's walk sideways.
Rintaro: Whatever. Get moving, assistant.
Kurisu: Hey, listen, please, just listen! I can't walk backwards!
Rintaro: Of course you can. You're my assistant.
Kurisu: I appreciate the vote of confidence, but I can't! I'm asking you to go sideways! No, I'm telling you to go sideways! Sideways! I'm going to fall!
UNSPOKEN: It's dark by the time we get to the lab. It's normally less than a fifteen minute walk, but since Kurisu kept begging to take breaks, it ended up taking twice as long.
Kurisu: Haah, we finally made it... I'm exhausted...
