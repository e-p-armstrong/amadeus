UNSPOKEN: Such a lovely smile. But he's a guy.
Mayuri: Such a beautiful master-disciple relationship. Mayushii's not a fujoshi, but she's getting a little excited.
Luka: Ehh!? M-Mayuri-chan, please don't imagine such things...
UNSPOKEN: Geez. Though we do have a master-disciple relationship. I, Hououin Kyouma, have gone to great lengths to brainwash -- er, I mean teach -- Lukako about the evil conspiracies that rule the world, and how to resist them. That stuff about Demon Sword Samidare is part of that training. Looks aside, Lukako is very obedient and hardworking. Plus, he's always eager to learn new things. A master couldn't ask for a better disciple. Though he does have the weaknesses of not catching on too quickly and being too shy.
Rintaro: What are you doing here, Mayuri?
Mayuri: I came to see Luka-kun. ComiMa's coming up next month, and I want him to cosplay as Kirari-chan from RaiNet. But he won't say yes...
Luka: But, cosplaying... that's just too embarrassing for me...
Mayuri: But I'm sure you'll look great in it! The phrase 'someone this cute can't be a girl' is really popular, you know? C'mon, make your cosplay debut!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri's hobby is making costumes. She's made at least thirty so far, but it's rare for her to wear one herself. Instead, she seems to get her kicks from seeing other people wear them. And it looks like she's chosen Lukako as her next target. Naturally, the costume Mayuri is currently raving about is for a female character. Normally, I would understand why a man wouldn't want to dress like a girl, but come on. Lukako has no problem wearing miko robes. Why should cosplay be any different?  But whatever. I have business to take care of.
Rintaro: Save the trivial stuff for later.
Mayuri: Ehh? But it's really important to Mayushii.
Rintaro: And it's trivial to me! Anyway, Lukako. There's a good reason for my being here today. I need you to perform an exorcism.
Luka: An exorcism? Then I'll go get my dad. Please wa--
Rintaro: No, it's nothing that serious. I just need some peace of mind.
UNSPOKEN: That's why I came here instead of Kanda Shrine.
Rintaro: So with that said, bring out the usual.
Luka: Um, the usual? You mean Samidare?
Rintaro: No! Who the hell uses a demon sword for an exorcism!? The usual for an exorcism should be obvious!
Luka: Uhh... um...?
Rintaro: I don't know what it's called, but it's that stick with the zigzaggy paper thingies that the priest does a shaky thingy with!
Mayuri: Ahaha! That sounded really dumb, Okarin!
UNSPOKEN: Quite a shock to hear that from Mayuri.
Luka: Oh, the oonusa. But, I don't know if my father will lend it to me... I'll go ask him.
