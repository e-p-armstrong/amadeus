UNSPOKEN: Lukako makes a quick bow, then runs off towards his house, which is on the shrine grounds. Meanwhile, Mayuri takes her pocket watch out of her bag to check the time. It’s a very old watch, not the sort you’d expect a high school girl to carry. Its name is Pockety. Obviously that’s the name Mayuri gave it, not its brand name or anything. Ever since elementary school, Mayuri has carried Pockety with her everywhere. It’s her most important treasure.
Mayuri: "Well, time for me to go to work!"
Rintaro: "Do your best. You going straight home afterwards?"
Mayuri: "Yup."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri lives in Ikebukuro. She comes to Akiba by train just about every day. It should be obvious since we’re childhood friends and all, but I live in Ikebukuro too. Though I’ve been staying at the lab since summer break began.
Mayuri: "See you tomorrow!"
UNSPOKEN: I call Mayuri to stop before she trots off.
Rintaro: "Wait, Mayuri. Back at Radi-Kan, you heard a man scream, right?"
Mayuri: "Scream?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri blinks several times and puts her finger to her temple as if in thought. Then she gives her usual smile.
Mayuri: "When was that again?"
Rintaro: "This afternoon."
Mayuri: "I don’t think I heard anything..."
Rintaro: "...Oh. Well, alright."
Mayuri: "Okarin’s a weirdo! Bye bye! Tutturu♪"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri leaves, this time for good, though she pauses to wave at least a half-dozen times before disappearing beyond the archway.
Luka: "Thanks for waiting, Okabe-san."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako returns shortly after Mayuri leaves. In his hands is the white zigzaggy thing I asked for.
Luka: "Dad let me borrow it. Thank goodness. Um, did Mayuri-chan leave?"
Rintaro: "Don’t worry about Mayuri. Begin the exorcism at once, Lukako!"
Luka: "Um, okay, but do you really want me to do it? What exactly am I exorcising, anyway?"
UNSPOKEN: Lukako is flustered. Is he really up to this? I’m beginning to doubt. I should have known better. The instant doubt touches my heart, a terrible chill shoots up my spine.
Rintaro: "Guh! It’s the evil spirit... in my arm!"
UNSPOKEN: I grab my violently shaking wrist.
Rintaro: "Be still, foul spirit! Guh... Hurry, Lukako! It’s trying to take over!"
Luka: "N-no way! Please hang in there, Okabe-san!"
Rintaro: "I’m not Okabe-san!"
Luka: "I’m sorry, Kyouma-san! Ahh, but what should I..."
Rintaro: "The exorcism... hurry! Just do it... like I taught you!"
Luka: "O-okay!"
UNSPOKEN: With a serious look on his face, Lukako grasps the oonusa with both hands as if it were a sword. His stance is impressive. I’ve taught him well.
Luka: "Ummm... ummm..."
