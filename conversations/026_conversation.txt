Mayuri: Well, time for me to go to work!
Rintaro: Do your best. You going straight home afterwards?
Mayuri: Yup.
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri lives in Ikebukuro. She comes to Akiba by train just about every day. It should be obvious since we're childhood friends and all, but I live in Ikebukuro too. Though I've been staying at the lab since summer break began.
Mayuri: See you tomorrow!
UNSPOKEN: I call Mayuri to stop before she trots off.
Rintaro: Wait, Mayuri. Back at Radi-Kan, you heard a man scream, right?
Mayuri: Scream?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri blinks several times and puts her finger to her temple as if in thought. Then she gives her usual smile.
Mayuri: When was that again?
Rintaro: This afternoon.
Mayuri: I don't think I heard anything...
Rintaro: ...Oh. Well, alright.
Mayuri: Okarin's a weirdo! Bye bye! Tutturuâ™ª
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri leaves, this time for good, though she pauses to wave at least a half-dozen times before disappearing beyond the archway.
Luka: Thanks for waiting, Okabe-san.
UNSPOKEN: Lukako returns shortly after Mayuri leaves. In his hands is the white zigzaggy thing I asked for.
Luka: Dad let me borrow it. Thank goodness. Um, did Mayuri-chan leave?
Rintaro: Don't worry about Mayuri. Begin the exorcism at once, Lukako!
Luka: Um, okay, but do you really want me to do it? What exactly am I exorcising, anyway?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako is flustered. Is he really up to this? I'm beginning to doubt. I should have known better. The instant doubt touches my heart, a terrible chill shoots up my spine.
Rintaro: Guh! It's the evil spirit... in my arm!
UNSPOKEN: I grab my violently shaking wrist.
Rintaro: Be still, foul spirit! Guh... Hurry, Lukako! It's trying to take over!
Luka: N-no way! Please hang in there, Okabe-san!
Rintaro: I'm not Okabe-san!
Luka: I'm sorry, Kyouma-san! Ahh, but what should I...
Rintaro: The exorcism... hurry! Just do it... like I taught you!
Luka: O-okay!
UNSPOKEN: With a serious look on his face, Lukako grasps the oonusa with both hands as if it were a sword. His stance is impressive. I've taught him well.
Luka: Ummm... ummm...
UNSPOKEN: His face is red, and he can barely talk. It looks like he wants to say something, but is hesitating. Panicking because he feels awkward? Tch. Amateur!
Rintaro: Please... Luka... expel... this spirit... from me... I don't... want to... kill you!
Luka: Uuh...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako starts crying. Looks like he's really worried. Reason tells me he's a guy, but his lovely appearance makes me feel guilty. Like I made a frail girl cry. But despite the tears welling up in his eyes, it looks like Lukako's managed to work up his resolve.
Luka: H-hear me, evil spirit!
