Rintaro: That's great! Now strike my arm with those zigzags!
Luka: Ei!!
UNSPOKEN: The tip of the oonusa touches my upper arm. In an anime, this would be the cue for some dramatic shockwave to occur, but nothing like that happens. The only sound is the chirping of cicadas.
Luka: D-did it work?
UNSPOKEN: I take a deep breath. The trembling in my arm has stopped.
Rintaro: ...I'm okay. Looks like you drove away the evil spirit. Good job, Lukako.
UNSPOKEN: Lukako sighs in relief and blushes.
Luka: I'm glad I was able to help.
UNSPOKEN: His shy smile really does make him look like a girl. After I get back to the lab, I take the broken TV down to the Braun Tube Workshop for repairs. Daru and Mayuri have already gone home, so I have to carry the TV down the narrow staircase by myself. It's brutal, back-breaking work, but I manage. I push the workshop door open with my hips and head inside. The room is dimly lit by the setting sun, but the gloom is offset by the glare from the gigantic CRT in the center of the room. A 42-inch CRT television. It doesn't seem like something you could get in modern Japan. With LCD TVs becoming the new standard, I seriously doubt anyone would want a bulky, old CRT.
???: Yo! What's up, Okabe?
UNSPOKEN: Sitting in front of the huge CRT is an equally huge man reading a sports newspaper. He's the workshop's manager, actually the owner of this whole building, Tennouji Yuugo. I call him Mister Braun. It's a fitting name for someone who loves Braun tubes.
Rintaro: What's up? That TV you gave me broke, that's what.
Tennouji: I bet you were treating it rough, weren't ya?
UNSPOKEN: I barely manage to set the heavy TV on the counter.
Tennouji: Love. You gotta' treat 'em with love!
UNSPOKEN: A muscle-bound bald guy talking about love... It sends shivers down my spine.
Rintaro: I'll need repairs post-haste.
