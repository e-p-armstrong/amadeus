UNSPOKEN: Same as me.
Tennouji: Student?
Amane: No.
UNSPOKEN: She shakes her head.
Tennouji: Why do you want to work here?
Suzuha: Because I love CRTs.
Tennouji: Hired! You start tomorrow!
Rintaro: Wait, what? Is this some sort of joke? Are we on camera!?
Suzuha: Thanks, boss.
UNSPOKEN: Finally, Amane Suzuha seems to relax. Then she looks at me.
Suzuha: Um, who are you?
Rintaro: You... dare ask my name? Banish the thought from your head, girl. To learn it would place your life in jeopardy. Countless women have learned my name only to find themselves targets of the Organization. Sarah in America, Claudia in Italy, Simone in France... I won't put anyone else in danger.
Tennouji: Hey, stop pulling things outta yer ass.
UNSPOKEN: He just doesn't understand my pain.
Tennouji: This idiot rents the second floor. Name's Okabe Rintaro.
Rintaro: My name is not Okabe. It's Hououin--
Tennouji: Quit it, or I raise your rent.
Rintaro: ...I'm Okabe Rintaro.
UNSPOKEN: The girl stands up, places her hand on my shoulder, and looks at me with a serious expression.
Suzuha: I don't know anything about this Organization that's after you. But if you're ever in trouble, Okabe Rintaro, let me know. I can help with stuff like that.
Rintaro: ...Huh?
Tennouji: ...?
UNSPOKEN: Stuff... like what?
Suzuha: If necessary, I can hurt them so bad they'll never bother you again.
Rintaro: Mister Braun, I don't think you should hire her.
Tennouji: Yeah. She might be a wild one. I'll fire her if she causes any trouble. Anyway, ignore that Organization nonsense. It's all in Okabe's head.
Suzuha: It is?
Rintaro: You just keep thinking that.
UNSPOKEN: But some day, the world will kneel before me. Muhahaha! And then, Amane Suzuha stares straight at me again. Maybe she has a habit of looking people in the eye.
Suzuha: So that's the current trend. Thanks for the tip!
UNSPOKEN: Trend? I don't think so.
Rintaro: ...so hot.
