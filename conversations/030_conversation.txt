Rintaro: "What the hell is this!? Are you mocking me!?"
UNSPOKEN: She lowers her head a little more. An apologetic bow, I guess.
Rintaro: "Just hand me your phone! I’ll enter it!"
Moeka: "...!"
UNSPOKEN: She shakes her head, clutching her phone with both hands as if to protect it from me. Like a spoiled child who can’t let go of a toy, she shields it from me with all her might. What does she think I’m going to do? Her reaction is a little depressing. Anyway, she’s obviously not going to hand her phone over, so I ask for her address instead. I’ll send her a blank mail. She told me her name a few minutes ago, but I forgot it already, so I enter her as Shining Finger. What am I doing standing here in the middle of the street? Let’s hurry up and send her a blank email. I don’t need to type anything. It’s just to give her my name. I already put her in my contacts. Just send a blank email to Shining Finger. And send. Her phone doesn’t react, and she gives me a questioning look. As I begin to wonder why it didn’t go through--
Rintaro: "Woah!"
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, my phone starts ringing. I look at the screen and see that Daru’s calling me.
Rintaro: "It’s me. What is it?"
Itaru: "What do you mean, ’what is it’? I’ve been waiting, you know? And what’s with that blank email?"
Rintaro: "Blank email? It went to you?"
Itaru: "It sure did."
Rintaro: "That was a mistake. Don’t worry. The email will self-destruct in 10 minutes."
Itaru: "Hey, just what are--"
UNSPOKEN: I sent the email to the wrong address. It’s no wonder she didn’t get it. Let’s try sending it again. I press the End button and ignore Daru’s call. Her phone’s not getting the email no matter how long we wait, so let’s try again. And, send. She’s staring at her phone. I don’t think I’ve ever met someone who made less eye contact. After a few seconds, her phone receives the email.
Moeka: "Okabe... Rintaro?"
Rintaro: "What!? How do you know that name!?"
Moeka: "From the blank email..."
UNSPOKEN: Damn, my email is still linked to my real name. I must change it at once!
Rintaro: "That’s just my alias. I’ll send another one with my true--"
Moeka: "No... this is fine."
Rintaro: "Nonsense! I am not Okabe Rintaro, but Hououin Kyou--"
UNSPOKEN: She’s really not buying it.
Rintaro: "Did you delete the picture?"
