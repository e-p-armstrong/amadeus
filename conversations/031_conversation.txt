Rintaro: "If you deleted it, then prove it."
UNSPOKEN: She silently shows me her screen. The only picture remaining is the one of that computer. That’s a relief.
Moeka: "I’ll email you... later. So ask... okay?"
Rintaro: "About what?"
Moeka: "...The urban legend."
UNSPOKEN: Oh, that. I almost forgot. With that, Shining Finger wanders off. Throughout the encounter, she kept the same cool expression. Actually, I don’t think we ever once made eye contact. And, send. Her phone doesn’t react, and she gives me a look that seems to ask something. Why won’t it transfer? We both look at her phone’s screen in bewilderment. What’s wrong? This is so annoying. I’ll send it again. And, send. Her phone doesn’t react, and she gives me a look, like she wants to asks something. Why won’t it transfer? We both examine her phone’s screen. This is getting annoying. I’ll send it again. And, send. Her phone is silent. She looks at me as if to ask something. What’s going on with the transfer? We both look at her phone’s screen in bewilderment. I’ll try to send it again. And, send. Her phone doesn’t react, and she gives me a look that seems to ask something. Why won’t it transfer? We both look at her phone’s screen in bewilderment. I’ll try to send it again. She frowns while looking at her own phone. And then she glances my way. I can feel those eyes clearly saying hurry up. But I’m hesitant. I’m not sure if it’s a good idea to give her my true name. But regardless of how long I hesitate, I don’t think that she’ll let me go until I send her the email. She sure is persistent. Looks like I have no choice but to send the email. We exchange a few words, and then I get away from her as fast as I can.
Maids: "Welcome back, Myaster!"
UNSPOKEN: I open the door to the MayQueen+Nyan² maid cafe, and two familiar cat-eared girls greet me with smiles.
Mayuri: "It’s Okarin!"
UNSPOKEN: One of them is Mayuri. But here, she’s called Mayushii NyanNyan. Since she works here, I stop by about twice a month. I guess that would make me a regular customer. Actually, I’ve never been to any other maid cafe.
Mayuri: "Welcome back, Okarin."
UNSPOKEN: After bowing again, Mayuri gasps as if she thought of something.
Mayuri: "Hey, Okarin! Mayushii just noticed something. ’Welcome back’ and ’Okarin’ go really well together!"
UNSPOKEN: Whatever...
Faris: "Kyouma! It’s great that you came, nya!"
