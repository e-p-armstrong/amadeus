Faris: Are you holding another secret meeting to overthrow the evil Organization, nya?
Rintaro: Uh, yeah, something like that.
Faris: Faris wants to join too, nya!
Rintaro: No chance. The Organization isn't threatened by cat-eared maids.
Faris: Not true, nya. Faris has the purrfect secret technique to help take them down.
Rintaro: What!? You've finally mastered that secret technique!?
Faris: Yes, nya... After completing my pilgrimage to the Guiana Highlands and overcoming my mentor's death, I finally mastered it.
UNSPOKEN: What mentor... Faris knows my true name, Hououin Kyouma. I've also told her all about the Organization. And now she's more into it that I am. She's always the one to bring up the subject whenever we meet. By the way, this the first time I've heard of this 'secret technique', or whatever it is.
Faris: So Faris wants to participate in the Spirit Conference like you promised, nya!
UNSPOKEN: Ugh... she's not letting it go. It'll take 30 minutes if I play along with her.
Rintaro: You're not suggesting we venture to the Sanctuary!? The answer is no. Although you may understand the Hidden Secrets, you're still too inexperienced.
Faris: But... but you promised, nya! Are you going to betray me!? My brother is waiting for me there...
UNSPOKEN: Since when do you have a brother!? And what the hell's this Spirit Conference anyway? Faris looks at me with actual tears in her eyes. I falter, even though I know it's just one of her cutesy acts. Whenever I talk with her, I run out of comebacks, which is really unusual for me. And then she takes the initiative, leaving me with nothing to do but listen to her fantasies. I mean, come on, you can only take it so far. There's a very clear difference between her stories and mine. As anyone can see, I speak nothing but the truth, while Faris has only delusions and a made-up backstory! I always have to play along. That's why I feel like I can never best her.
Mayuri: Umm, I don't quite get it, but can Mayushii go to the Sanctuary too?
UNSPOKEN: Great, now look who's joined in. It's just going to get worse from here. I have to end this conversation now!
Rintaro: You can't come. This discussion is over.
Mayuri: Ehhh?
Faris: No fair, Kyouma!
Mayuri: That's right! Leaving Mayushii and Feris-chan behind is mean!
Rintaro: ...Who's is 'Feris'?
Mayuri: Feris-chan is Feris-chan. Right?
Faris: Right!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri and Faris look at each other and smile. Is she talking about this Faris? Is that her real name? Have I been mistaken all this time? That's a disturbing thought...
Mayuri: Well, Mayushii has a hard time saying Faris, so I call her Feris-chan instead!
Rintaro: Oh, so that's it.
Faris: It's like we're in a girl's school. That's not too... tabby.
