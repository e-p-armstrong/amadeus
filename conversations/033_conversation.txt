Faris: Nyahaha! Sorry, nya. Table for two, this way, nyan♪ Mayushii, I'll leave it to you, nyan nyan.
Mayuri: Leave it to me, nyan nyan♪
UNSPOKEN: If you hadn't noticed, the cat-eared maids here at MayQueen+Nyan² are required to add cat sounds -- nyas and nyans -- to their words with some frequency. Mayuri takes my hand and leads me inside. Apparently, Mayushii NyanNyan is the only one who leads customers by the hand like this. It probably comes naturally to her. She doesn't even realize the effect it has on her customers. And that's why she's second to Faris in popularity at this maid cafe. She guides me to Daru's table. The tables are about 60% full. Among Akiba's maid cafes, MayQueen+Nyan²'s popularity is solid, but not booming.  Considering what Faris and the others are wearing, it's more like a cosplay cafe than a maid cafe. Furthermore, the cat ears and NyanNyanian dialect makes it less accessible to low-level otaku and first timers. On the other hand, those same cat ears are a topic of heated debate among die-hard maid cafe fans. These two viewpoints clash. This place is one of the older maid cafes in Akihabara, but it doesn't get much media exposure. Maybe that's what makes it more comfortable than most. At least, that's what Daru says. He talks about this stuff so much that it's been burned into my synapses.
Mayuri: Daru-kun, Okarin is here, nyan.
Itaru: You're way late. Seriously, man.
UNSPOKEN: Daru sits in front of me, but doesn't look my way. He looks upset for some reason.
Itaru: So, what were you just talking about with Faris? I want details.
Rintaro: ...You really want to know? I don't think you'd understand it.
UNSPOKEN: Hell, even I didn't get most of it.
Itaru: Ah, the usual... Your conversations are too much for regular otaku. You guys exude an aura or something, you know? It's like you too have your own Reality Marble! You know I can't forgive you!
Mayuri: I think Feris-chan likes Okarin, nya. Of all the maids and masters here, nya, the only one who can keep up with Feris-chan is you, Okarin.
UNSPOKEN: I'm not even close to keeping up with her.
Itaru: I'm so jealous! You lucky bastard!
Rintaro: Hmph, I have no interest in women who dress themselves in lies.
Itaru: Like you're one to talk.
Rintaro: Silence, you unfaithful bastard! All your 2D wives are crying.
Itaru: Gwahh, you struck a nerve, man...
UNSPOKEN: Daru theatrically grabs his chest and falls onto the table. I sip from one of the glasses of water that Mayuri brought to our table.
Mayuri: Master, may I take your order, nya?
