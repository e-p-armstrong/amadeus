Itaru: "I’m so jealous! You lucky bastard!"
Rintaro: "Hmph, I have no interest in women who dress themselves in lies."
Itaru: "Like you’re one to talk."
Rintaro: "Silence, you unfaithful bastard! All your 2D wives are crying."
Itaru: "Gwahh, you struck a nerve, man..."
UNSPOKEN: Daru theatrically grabs his chest and falls onto the table. I sip from one of the glasses of water that Mayuri brought to our table.
Mayuri: "Master, may I take your order, nya?"
Rintaro: "Omelet rice. And hot coffee. Black."
Mayuri: "Coming right up, nyan nyan♪"
UNSPOKEN: After taking my order, Mayuri finds her way towards the counter as if swimming between the rows of tables. I hope she doesn’t trip.
Itaru: "So, what did you need?"
UNSPOKEN: Daru asks without getting up from the table. That’s right. In my confrontations with Shining Finger and Catgirl, I almost forgot my original objective.
Itaru: "I was gonna head to the lab in about an hour."
Rintaro: "I have an urgent matter to discuss. Top secret."
UNSPOKEN: I lean on the table and scan the area without moving my head.
Rintaro: "You remember John Titor?"
Itaru: "...John Titor? Who’s that?"
Rintaro: "The self-proclaimed time traveler who appeared on the internet about 10 years ago. I thought we talked about him before."
Itaru: "Is this a new addition to your made-up backstory?"
Rintaro: "It’s nothing like that! Everything I say is the truth!"
Itaru: "What a pain. Well, I guess I can play along. So, what’s the source on this Titor guy being from the future?"
Rintaro: "Wait, you’ve seriously never heard about him before?"
Itaru: "Seriously, bro, I haven’t."
Rintaro: "Sure you didn’t just forget?"
Itaru: "I can’t say for sure."
Rintaro: "There are even books about him."
Itaru: "I might remember if you show me one."
Rintaro: "You really don’t remember?"
Itaru: "Memories fade. We’re not computers, man."
UNSPOKEN: This is wrong. I remember talking to Daru about John Titor back in high school. It was only idle talk, so it’s possible that Daru forgot about it. Daru is quite the internet addict, but the internet lets you choose what information you want to see. There’s no guarantee Daru looked up info on John Titor. If he had, I doubt he would have forgotten so completely. Is it my memories that are mistaken, or everyone else’s?
Rintaro: "Then what about the IBN 5100?"
Itaru: "Woah, you know about that? Cool."
Rintaro: "So you know about it?"
Itaru: "It’s the model IBN released back in 1975."
UNSPOKEN: Right. That’s what John Titor said on @channel. He traveled to 1975 first, obtained an IBN 5100, then leaped to 1998.
Rintaro: "What kind of computer is it?"
Itaru: "The stupidly expensive kind. Back when it came out, computers were so expensive that average people couldn’t get their hands on them. It was full of proprietary IBN technology, and was a pretty powerful computer for its time. Then six years later, in 1981, IBN launched the popular IBN PC series. Now that’s more famous. Anyway, it’s not like I’m an expert. This is just stuff I read on a wiki."
