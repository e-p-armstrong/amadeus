Rintaro: Hmm. I see.
UNSPOKEN: My phone suddenly starts vibrating. It stops after about 3 seconds. Looks like I got mail. I can check it whenever I want, but... I'm talking to Daru now, so it can probably wait. Oh come on... What's with this mail? Disregarding the weird timing... Is this really the gloomy, unsociable woman I met in front of Radi-Kan? She's like a completely different person in this email. Does she have split personalities or something? Hmmm... well, I got some info about the IBN 5100, so I guess I should give her a reply. But if I send an immediate reply to a woman I just met, won't I come off as clingy and desperate? I, Hououin Kyouma, will not be taken lightly. This is my chance to make her understand which one of us is the superior human being. And above all, I have yet to ascertain if she can be trusted. She might start harassing me if I reply the wrong way. And besides, she hasn't proven that she's not working for the Organization. Nonetheless, it couldn't hurt to tell her what I learned from Daru. To discourage her, of course. Muhahaha! I tell Daru to wait a bit as I start typing out a response. It's not like I trust her, but I figure I should tell her what I learned from Daru. And then she'll be completely discouraged. Muhahaha! Ok, sent. What!? A response already!? Hardly any time lag!? As always, Shining Finger, your digits defy the laws of physics. I start reading the mail. Oh, dammit! Just as I thought, that woman has a predisposition for harassment. I never should have gotten involved with her. Let's not reply to this one. I've fulfilled my minimum obligation. I have nothing to feel guilty about.
Rintaro: Sorry for the wait, Daru.
UNSPOKEN: Let's ignore it. This is out of kindness. Mmhmm.
Rintaro: Sorry for the wait, Daru. So, there's one thing I need to know.
UNSPOKEN: I scan the area with my eyes once more. Then I lean in close.
Rintaro: The IBN 5100 has the power to destroy the world, right?
Itaru: What? It doesn't have the power to do anything, let alone destroy the damn world.
Faris: What this, nya? The world's gonna be destroyed, nya?
UNSPOKEN: Faris brings my omelet rice. She's doing her cat-like gestures while keeping her tray balanced on one hand. True feline agility. Despite her NyanNyanian nonsense, Faris is the consummate professional.
Faris: Master, thanks for waiting nyan nyan♪ Omelet rice, nyan!
UNSPOKEN: The catgirl puts the omelet rice on the table and then takes a bottle of ketchup from her apron pocket. She uses it to write THE WORLD IS DOOMED!! in red letters upon the omelet's blank yellow canvas.
Faris: Please enjoy your meal before the world ends♪
