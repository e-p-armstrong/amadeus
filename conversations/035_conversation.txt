Itaru: "You bet I have. Just last month there was big talk about it on the net. Some @channelers heard the rumors and went searching for it. My friend on FrePara, Sister Centipede, was the main person behind that. Even the legendary ’Neidhardt der Blitzschnelle’ joined the fray, but they still couldn’t find it."
Rintaro: "So it was just a hoax?"
Itaru: "Who knows? There are tons of underground shops in Akiba. It wouldn’t be strange if an IBN 5100 suddenly turned up in some hole in the wall."
Rintaro: "Hmm. I see."
UNSPOKEN: My phone suddenly starts vibrating. It stops after about 3 seconds. Looks like I got mail. I can check it whenever I want, but... I’m talking to Daru now, so it can probably wait. Oh come on... What’s with this mail? Disregarding the weird timing... Is this really the gloomy, unsociable woman I met in front of Radi-Kan? She’s like a completely different person in this email. Does she have split personalities or something? Hmmm... well, I got some info about the IBN 5100, so I guess I should give her a reply. But if I send an immediate reply to a woman I just met, won’t I come off as clingy and desperate? I, Hououin Kyouma, will not be taken lightly. This is my chance to make her understand which one of us is the superior human being. And above all, I have yet to ascertain if she can be trusted. She might start harassing me if I reply the wrong way. And besides, she hasn’t proven that she’s not working for the Organization. Nonetheless, it couldn’t hurt to tell her what I learned from Daru. To discourage her, of course. Muhahaha! I tell Daru to wait a bit as I start typing out a response. It’s not like I trust her, but I figure I should tell her what I learned from Daru. And then she’ll be completely discouraged. Muhahaha! Ok, sent. What!? A response already!? Hardly any time lag!? As always, Shining Finger, your digits defy the laws of physics. I start reading the mail. Oh, dammit! Just as I thought, that woman has a predisposition for harassment. I never should have gotten involved with her. Let’s not reply to this one. I’ve fulfilled my minimum obligation. I have nothing to feel guilty about.
Rintaro: "Sorry for the wait, Daru."
UNSPOKEN: Let’s ignore it. This is out of kindness. Mmhmm.
Rintaro: "Sorry for the wait, Daru. So, there’s one thing I need to know."
UNSPOKEN: I scan the area with my eyes once more. Then I lean in close.
Rintaro: "The IBN 5100 has the power to destroy the world, right?"
Itaru: "What? It doesn’t have the power to do anything, let alone destroy the damn world."
Faris: "What this, nya? The world’s gonna be destroyed, nya?"
