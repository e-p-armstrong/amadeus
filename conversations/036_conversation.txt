Faris: "Master, thanks for waiting nyan nyan♪ Omelet rice, nyan!"
UNSPOKEN: The catgirl puts the omelet rice on the table and then takes a bottle of ketchup from her apron pocket. She uses it to write THE WORLD IS DOOMED!! in red letters upon the omelet’s blank yellow canvas.
Faris: "Please enjoy your meal before the world ends♪"
Itaru: "Woah, ’The World is Doomed!!’ for the win! Faris’s handwriting is so cute it puts my ’omelet’ in danger too!"
UNSPOKEN: It appears the cuteness has shattered Daru’s sanity. I give him a look that says ’calm down’, but to no avail. I smooth out the ketchup with the bottom of my spoon, erasing the ketchup words.
Itaru: "Ahh... what a waste..."
UNSPOKEN: I’m going to eat it either way.
Faris: "Daru-nyan, Daru-nyan, have you considered participating in the Faris Cup, nya?"
Itaru: "Yeah, of course I’m participating!"
Rintaro: "Faris Cup? What’s that?"
UNSPOKEN: I take a mouthful of omelet rice.
Faris: "Next Sunday, we’re hosting a RaiNet tournament at the cafe, nya!"
UNSPOKEN: Faris starts dancing in place. I’d prefer she not jump around like that when people are eating nearby.
Faris: "Faris is the event organizer. It’s all my idea, nyan! You can participate too if you want, Kyouma! Entrance fee is 1000 yen and includes a drink. Whoever beats Faris gets to enjoy some of Faris’ home-cooking, nya."
Itaru: "It’ll never happen. Okarin sucks at RaiNet."
Faris: "Nya? But it’s so fun."
Rintaro: "No, I’m fine..."
UNSPOKEN: I stop shoveling the omelet rice into my mouth. Then I deliver a melancholy sigh.
Rintaro: "RaiNet AccessBattlers, huh... Whenever I hear that name, I remember the former champion... Has it already been two years? No, it’s nothing. Forget what I said."
Faris: "NyaNya? That sounded so serious, nya! Who was the former champion, nya?"
Itaru: "He probably doesn’t exist. I mean, RaiNet didn’t even have official tournaments until about a year ago."
Faris: "Kyouma... you still can’t forget him, can you, nya?"
Rintaro: "What?"
Faris: "I remember that you and the champion -- my brother -- were such good friends, Kyouma. You were so close it made me jealous, nya."
UNSPOKEN: Dammit. She took my story and ran with it again! I never even said anything about him being her brother! Hell, I don’t know if Faris even has siblings! I shouldn’t have talked about stuff like this in front of Faris!
Faris: "But it’s time to let go of the past! Seize the day with your own paws!"
UNSPOKEN: Her shout resounds throughout the store. Her finger snaps at me.
Faris: "Even though it’s painful... no, because it’s painful, I succeeded my brother’s dying wish and purrfected my skills as a RaiNetter, nya! Do you remember, nya? He always used to say, ’Some day, let’s bring peace to the world with RaiNet--’"
