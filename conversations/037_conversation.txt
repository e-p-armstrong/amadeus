UNSPOKEN: Daru explains with a wry smile.
Itaru: She's gone undefeated in over 400 unofficial matches.
Rintaro: Is she Rickson Gracie?
UNSPOKEN: Daru ignores my perfect retort.
Itaru: It's so disappointing that Faris doesn't go to official tournaments. She'd win if she did, no doubt.
Rintaro: Why doesn't she?
Itaru: I'm sure it's for the customers! She probably doesn't want to inconvenience the store. Truly a model maid. Also, she's Mayushii's age, so she probably has school too.
Rintaro: She doesn't want to inconvenience the store, yet she's holding the Faris Cup here?
Itaru: That doesn't matter at all! The point is, Faris is cute, and cuteness is justice. Cute cat-eared maids are sweet, if you know what I mean. And that's all that matters, right?
Rintaro: So in the end, do you bat for the 2D team, or the 3D team?
Itaru: I dare say I'm bi!
Rintaro: You're an inspiration, Daru.
Itaru: I know. I'm just too awesome.
UNSPOKEN: Daru usually doesn't show enthusiasm for anything. The exceptions are moe and Faris. I wish he were this passionate about our experiments. I had to pull Daru away from Faris so we could return to the lab. We arrive to find it hotter than a sauna in hell. I quickly open the windows, letting a small breeze blow in. It won't be enough. I flip our fan to full power and place it on the table in front of me. I really wish we had an air conditioner. I turn on the computer. This is our PC for communal use among lab members. It still uses an old CRT monitor, so it looks ancient. But don't let its looks deceive you. Our computer wiz, Daru, scrounged up some parts and made some mods to it. In any case, I don't spend much time on it. I mostly use it to update the Future Gadget Laboratory's homepage, check my email, visit news sites, and browse @channel. I wonder if the new Titor is still posting. Woah, I shouldn't waste all day on @channel. We have more important things to deal with. Namely, the PhoneWave (name subject to change). We haven't experimented with it since yesterday. It's high time I figure out what's going on with that thing. Earlier, I asked Daru to connect the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to the computer. He finished setting it up yesterday, and now he's about to do the quick wire work in the development room.
Rintaro: Hey, Daru. What's with the X68000?
UNSPOKEN: I mean, it's a 20-year-old machine with specs lower than my cellphone.
Itaru: It's cool. Duh.
Rintaro: So, it's like the reason why some protagonists are odd-eyed even though they're Japanese?
Itaru: Not getting you, bro.
Rintaro: It's cool.
Itaru: If it's cool, then it's cool. Anyway, there wasn't much of an option. This was the only PC we weren't using.
