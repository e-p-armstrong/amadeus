Faris: "NyaNya?"
UNSPOKEN: I present my empty plate to Faris. I always eat quickly. It’s a habit I picked up naturally during my years on the run from the Organization. Screw the slow food trend.
Faris: "Sure thing, Master! Just a moment, nya♪"
UNSPOKEN: Faris takes the dish and heads back to the counter. Whew... if I’d left things going as they were, I would’ve had to play along for another 10 minutes in her fantasy world.
Itaru: "Faris is one of the most skilled Rainetters I know."
UNSPOKEN: Daru explains with a wry smile.
Itaru: "She’s gone undefeated in over 400 unofficial matches."
Rintaro: "Is she Rickson Gracie?"
UNSPOKEN: Daru ignores my perfect retort.
Itaru: "It’s so disappointing that Faris doesn’t go to official tournaments. She’d win if she did, no doubt."
Rintaro: "Why doesn’t she?"
Itaru: "I’m sure it’s for the customers! She probably doesn’t want to inconvenience the store. Truly a model maid. Also, she’s Mayushii’s age, so she probably has school too."
Rintaro: "She doesn’t want to inconvenience the store, yet she’s holding the Faris Cup here?"
Itaru: "That doesn’t matter at all! The point is, Faris is cute, and cuteness is justice. Cute cat-eared maids are sweet, if you know what I mean. And that’s all that matters, right?"
Rintaro: "So in the end, do you bat for the 2D team, or the 3D team?"
Itaru: "I dare say I’m bi!"
Rintaro: "You’re an inspiration, Daru."
Itaru: "I know. I’m just too awesome."
