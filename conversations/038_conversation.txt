UNSPOKEN: I mean, it’s a 20-year-old machine with specs lower than my cellphone.
Itaru: "It’s cool. Duh."
Rintaro: "So, it’s like the reason why some protagonists are odd-eyed even though they’re Japanese?"
Itaru: "Not getting you, bro."
Rintaro: "It’s cool."
Itaru: "If it’s cool, then it’s cool. Anyway, there wasn’t much of an option. This was the only PC we weren’t using."
Rintaro: "What about your new one?"
Itaru: "No way. We don’t know what could happen when it’s connected to your crazy machine. It could kill the performance."
UNSPOKEN: Selfish bastard. Besides, we made the PhoneWave (name subject to change) together. It’s our crazy machine.
Itaru: "Anyway, did you do any research on the gelification?"
Rintaro: "Yeah, at the university this morning."
UNSPOKEN: Why would a banana gelify? What kind of science are we dealing with here?
Rintaro: "I examined a sample under a microscope and found it was shredded at the molecular level."
Itaru: "Shredded?"
Rintaro: "It’s not a mere phase transition. The banana became something entirely different."
Itaru: "Could it have rotted? ...Nah. There’s no way 2 minutes in the microwave could do that."
Rintaro: "Then I remembered about fractal structures."
Itaru: "The Menger sponge thing?"
Rintaro: "Yeah. It looked like something drilled holes into the banana. An infinite number of holes in a fractal pattern, right down to the nano level."
Itaru: "Whoa. What could do something like that?"
Rintaro: "I have one hypothesis..."
UNSPOKEN: Adding a dramatic pause to build tension. Daru gulps, waiting for me to continue.
Rintaro: "It’s the result of the microwave’s electromagnetic waves."
Itaru: "W-what does that mean?"
Rintaro: "If my guess is correct, then our PhoneWave (name subject to change) has the potential to become a weapon of unprecedented destructive power, one that could change the face of war as we know it. Hehehe."
UNSPOKEN: I twist my lips into a maniacal grin. Then I whip out my phone and put it to my ear.
Rintaro: "It’s me. We’re proceeding to stage two of the plan. Soon they will learn... that Judgment Day is near. All shall be as Steins Gate wills. Resistance is futile. El Psy Kongroo."
Itaru: "Quit talking to your imaginary friend. I’m done with the wiring."
UNSPOKEN: I want to explain that he’s not imaginary, but revealing the identity of my contact would be a betrayal. The last thing I need is another enemy, especially one whose power and cunning rivals that of the Organization. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is now an indecipherable mess of wires. All we did was hook it up to a computer, yet it turned out like something MacDyver would put together. Now we can access the microwave’s terminal mode and see exactly what’s going on in its computer brain.
Itaru: "Well? What’s next?"
Rintaro: "We have bananas."
