Itaru: No way. We don't know what could happen when it's connected to your crazy machine. It could kill the performance.
UNSPOKEN: Selfish bastard. Besides, we made the PhoneWave (name subject to change) together. It's our crazy machine.
Itaru: Anyway, did you do any research on the gelification?
Rintaro: Yeah, at the university this morning.
UNSPOKEN: Why would a banana gelify? What kind of science are we dealing with here?
Rintaro: I examined a sample under a microscope and found it was shredded at the molecular level.
Itaru: Shredded?
Rintaro: It's not a mere phase transition. The banana became something entirely different.
Itaru: Could it have rotted? ...Nah. There's no way 2 minutes in the microwave could do that.
Rintaro: Then I remembered about fractal structures.
Itaru: The Menger sponge thing?
Rintaro: Yeah. It looked like something drilled holes into the banana. An infinite number of holes in a fractal pattern, right down to the nano level.
Itaru: Whoa. What could do something like that?
Rintaro: I have one hypothesis...
UNSPOKEN: Adding a dramatic pause to build tension. Daru gulps, waiting for me to continue.
Rintaro: It's the result of the microwave's electromagnetic waves.
Itaru: W-what does that mean?
Rintaro: If my guess is correct, then our PhoneWave (name subject to change) has the potential to become a weapon of unprecedented destructive power, one that could change the face of war as we know it. Hehehe.
UNSPOKEN: I twist my lips into a maniacal grin. Then I whip out my phone and put it to my ear.
Rintaro: It's me. We're proceeding to stage two of the plan. Soon they will learn... that Judgment Day is near. All shall be as Steins Gate wills. Resistance is futile. El Psy Kongroo.
Itaru: Quit talking to your imaginary friend. I'm done with the wiring.
UNSPOKEN: I want to explain that he's not imaginary, but revealing the identity of my contact would be a betrayal. The last thing I need is another enemy, especially one whose power and cunning rivals that of the Organization. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is now an indecipherable mess of wires. All we did was hook it up to a computer, yet it turned out like something MacDyver would put together. Now we can access the microwave's terminal mode and see exactly what's going on in its computer brain.
Itaru: Well? What's next?
Rintaro: We have bananas.
UNSPOKEN: Just before I left MayQueen+NyanÂ², Mayuri asked me to buy some bananas. With her money. She's too nice for her own good. Or maybe she didn't even consider what would happen. By now, you'd think she'd know that if I buy bananas, I'm going to experiment on them. And so, I put the entire bunch of bananas into the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Itaru: You know Mayu-shi's gonna cry if you use them all, right? Wasn't it her money?
Rintaro: She donated that money to our research efforts.
Itaru: You don't have to use the whole thing. One is enough. One.
