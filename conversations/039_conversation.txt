Itaru: "You know Mayu-shi’s gonna cry if you use them all, right? Wasn’t it her money?"
Rintaro: "She donated that money to our research efforts."
Itaru: "You don’t have to use the whole thing. One is enough. One."
UNSPOKEN: Daru retrieves the bananas, peels one from the bunch, and sticks it back inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Rintaro: "We’ll never reshape the fabric of society as long as money dictates the limits of our science."
Itaru: "You’re the only one who wants to reshape society, Okarin."
UNSPOKEN: He lost all enthusiasm the second we got back to the lab. What a fickle man.
Itaru: "C’mon, start the timer already."
UNSPOKEN: Right. Now, where did I put my phone... Phone, phone... Call complete. Instant access.
Guidance: "Hello. This is the PhoneWave (name subject to change)."
UNSPOKEN: The Mayushii Guidance system.
Guidance: "You can operate the timer from this menu. After pushing the # button, please enter the heating time in seconds."
Rintaro: "In hindsight, we should’ve made the Mayushii Guidance skippable. Having to wait each time is quite annoying."
Guidance: "For example, press ’#60’ for one minute. For two minutes, press ’#120’."
UNSPOKEN: It’s finally over. Ok, entering 120#... When I finish typing, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) starts up with a low hum.
Itaru: "You messed up."
UNSPOKEN: Crap, this is just normal heating. I manually set the timer back to 0 and start typing again. This time, we’re going to ignore the guidance and enter 120#. Crap, I messed up. Let’s start over. Ignore the guidance and enter 120#. Complete. The turntable inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change) begins to spin backwards.
Rintaro: "Two minutes sure is long..."
UNSPOKEN: It doesn’t actually have to be two minutes. Mayuri had the timer set to two minutes when she first discovered the freezing function -- or whatever it is -- so we’re just reproducing that. Naturally, we have experimented with 60 seconds and 180 seconds too. If we set it shorter, the freezing only goes halfway, if at all. Conversely, setting it longer increases the effect.
Itaru: "You know, if the microwave’s emissions are doing it, then shouldn’t our cells be getting gelified too?"
UNSPOKEN: While still looking bored, Daru finally gets into the discussion at hand.
Rintaro: "Well, have you ever nuked yourself inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change)?"
Itaru: "I can’t even fit in there. Anyway, what’s your source on the electromagnetic waves?"
Rintaro: "If you must know... it’s my mad scientist’s intuition."
Itaru: "Oh, so no facts."
Rintaro: "Edison once said, ’Without one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent of perspiration is wasted. So, inventors of the world... be inspired!’ End quote."
Itaru: "Wasn’t it ’Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration’?"
