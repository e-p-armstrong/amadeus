UNSPOKEN: It feels like I wasted 120 seconds on nothing. Daru opens the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s door and peeks inside.
Itaru: What? What!?
UNSPOKEN: He rubs his eyes, blinks several times, then resumes staring into the microwave.
Rintaro: What are you doing?
Itaru: Well... uh... it's... ...gone.
Rintaro: Gone? What's gone?
Itaru: The banana.
UNSPOKEN: What is he talking about? I push Daru aside and look into the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Rintaro: ...It's gone.
UNSPOKEN: There's nothing inside. The banana has vanished without a trace. After a short pause to collect myself, I whip out my phone and speak into the silence.
Rintaro: It's me. Slight problem. We may have awakened something... terrible.
Itaru: Wh-what do you mean something terrible!?
UNSPOKEN: I ignore Daru's panicked cry. I'm surprised too. My heart's pounding. But I try to appear calm.
Rintaro: I'm invoking Emergency Order 666. Activate the Coldheart Protocol! What!? What do you mean we need congressional approval!? There's no time, you fool! Tokyo will be blasted to atoms!
UNSPOKEN: I put my phone away after yelling.
Itaru: Y-you should be an actor.
Rintaro: S-shut up, you Faris stalker! Where'd you hide the banana?
Itaru: Who's a stalker!?
Rintaro: The banana. Where is it? Are you planning on become a street magician or something?
Itaru: You're the one who hid it, aren't you?
UNSPOKEN: Uncomfortable silence. I realize my throat is dry.
Rintaro: Where the hell did it go!?
Itaru: How should I know!?
Rintaro: Where did you go? Banaana! BANAAANA!
UNSPOKEN: I take the turntable out of the microwave, scour every nook and cranny, but find neither peel nor stem of the banana.
Rintaro: W-wait... I think I get it now! It's not an electromagnetic weapon, it's a teleportation device!
Itaru: Wh-what!? Wait, that's absurd.
Rintaro: How else could it have vanished? The microwave was closed!
Itaru: Um, maybe we should just calm down.
Rintaro: Y-yeah. You're right...
UNSPOKEN: We each take a deep breath. Oh, I know. I'll eat one of the remaining bananas. That will calm me down. I reach for the bunch of bananas.
Rintaro: What... the...!?
UNSPOKEN: Impossible. Impossible! Not three minutes ago, Daru plucked a banana from the bunch and put it inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change). But now, there's no sign that a banana was ever plucked. Instead, a single gelified banana has appeared among the regular bananas.
Itaru: Oh shit! What the hell's going on?
UNSPOKEN: Daru notices it too. He reaches out to touch it, but I quickly stop him.
Rintaro: Wait! How many bananas are in the lab right now!?
Itaru: J-just these, I think...
Rintaro: Is this gelbana attached to the same stem as the banana you just picked?
Itaru: I dunno, man... I wasn't paying attention. It doesn't look like it was ever plucked...
