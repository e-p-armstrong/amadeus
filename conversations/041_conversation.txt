UNSPOKEN: Kurisu and I ignore Daru's nonsense.
Rintaro: Naked, you mean it becomes observable.
Kurisu: When the event horizon disappears, there's no more reason for time and space to change places. Meaning that you can enter a naked singularity without being trapped. And then the existence of the naked singularity allows the principle of causality to be violated and the general theory of relativity to fail. The laws of physics are broken!
Rintaro: C-can such a thing exist?
UNSPOKEN: The negation of the theory of relativity and the principle of causality means serious paradoxes can occur. Didn't Kurisu say that earlier?
Kurisu: Nothing in principle stops Kerr black holes from existing. It seems inconsistent, but the math never lies. Since the principle of causality fails, it would be possible to travel to the past by entering a naked singularity.
UNSPOKEN: John Titor said the same thing. So Titor's time machine is using SERN's technology. But Titor's time machine was compact, small enough to fit into a car. The LHC is 27 kilometers long, but they managed to get it down to travel size in just 24 years.
Kurisu: One thing I don't understand is how they inject electrons into the singularity. Look. This is a picture of the LHC, but there's strange equipment installed at the proton collision site. It looks like they call it a 'lifter', but... just what is it?
Rintaro: Daru, have you heard of it?
Itaru: Lifter, lifter... I think I saw that in the Z Program files. Wanna google it?
UNSPOKEN: Daru opens up a browser window and enters lifter into a search engine.
Itaru: We've got hits!
UNSPOKEN: About 422, 000 results.
Kurisu: That many? I guess it's not a secret...
Rintaro: Could this be it? Ionocraft.
Kurisu: Ions are charged particles. The meaning matches.
UNSPOKEN: We click on a link that says Ionocraft (lifter). It takes us to a video. Looks like some dim garage. But it doesn't seem like anything secretive. Just a garage like you'd see in an average American home. At the center of the screen is a triangular shape made of some kind of metal. It looks about 10 cm high, and about 30 cm wide. It's connected to some sort of generator by a thin wire. Looks like some really cheap equipment. That's all there is. Nothing else. After explaining something in some language I don't understand -- Russian, maybe? -- the person filming the video slowly turns the power on. And then--
Itaru: It's floating...
UNSPOKEN: The silvery triangle floats soundlessly into the air. Then it remains stationary.
Rintaro: That's... an anti-gravity device!
Kurisu: Don't be ridiculous. That would be the breakthrough of the century. It's called an ionocraft, so it probably has something to do with electrodes and charged air...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu doesn't sound as confident as she usually does. We look up information on the ionocraft lifter. Lots of sites have detailed instructions on how to make lifters, but I don't know how they work since the sites all give conflicting theories.
Rintaro: SERN is using this lifter technology. It's a vital component of their time machine. If they can manipulate a micro singularity's mass and gravitational field, then these things really are anti-gravity devices!
Kurisu: Well, under those exact conditions, I guess you might not be entirely wrong.
UNSPOKEN: Incredible! My curiosity's growing more by the second.
Kurisu: But it looks like SERN's having trouble adjusting their lifter. They don't have full control over the micro singularity's gravity. So they can't make a true naked singularity.
Rintaro: That must be the reason why the subjects turned into jellymen.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu nods.
Kurisu: Since the singularity is still closed, the subject is crushed by its tremendous gravity. As a result, substances become fractalized. Let's go with that hypothesis. Of course, there's no way to be sure that it's right. It might take months to prove.
