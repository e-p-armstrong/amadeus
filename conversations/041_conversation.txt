Rintaro: H-hey, Daru... could this possibly be...
UNSPOKEN: The word I spoke impulsively a few seconds ago. I hesitate to speak it again. But I must. Because no matter how unbelievable it may be, we saw it with our own eyes! My head's full of question marks. I don't know how this happened. But if I were to explain it as I saw it... The banana that was inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change) returned instantly to its bunch. In other words...
Rintaro: A teleporter... we've invented a teleporter!
???: Oh?
UNSPOKEN: I hear a girl's voice coming from the lounge.
???: That looks like an interesting experiment.
Rintaro: Who's there!?
UNSPOKEN: My heart just skipped a beat. I turn towards the voice in surprise. And get pierced by a sharp stare.
Rintaro: Impossible! What are you doing here!? The 18-year-old genius girl! A sadist who humiliates men in public! Also known as The Zombie! Makise... Kurisu!
Itaru: Nice exposition, bro.
Kurisu: Who are you calling a zombie?
Rintaro: What is the meaning of this!? What is your purpose here?
Kurisu: I'm here to see you, Okabe Rintaro-san. Or is it Hououin Kyouma-san?
UNSPOKEN: Wait. How the hell does she know my real name? I've never spoken it in front of her!
Rintaro: I was right! You're one of the Organization's top agents, an esper with superhuman powers! No wonder you rose from the dead!
Kurisu: I'm not dead, alright? Please stop killing me off. Hashida-san, can you do something about this guy?
Itaru: You came at a bad time, Makise-shi, with Okarin freaking out like this.
UNSPOKEN: Daru doesn't seem phased by this girl's entrance. Why?
Rintaro: Have you betrayed me, Daru!?
Itaru: Calm down, man.
Rintaro: Are you being blackmailed? Or did she seduce you?
UNSPOKEN: I glare at Kurisu. He's my right-hand man! How dare you!?
Rintaro: YOU'VE CROSSED THE LINE, BIIITTCH!
Kurisu: Get ahold of yourself.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's eyes flash dangerously... I think. Such intensity from an 18-year-old. Maybe she didn't resurrect after her first death. Maybe she's a robotic killing machine, constructed to replace the dead Kurisu. Is that it? For now, I'll do as I'm told.
Kurisu: Hashida-san gave me the address after yesterday's lecture. He also told me your name.
UNSPOKEN: That's all? The truth is... kind of a let down.
Rintaro: So you're here to see me, is that it?
Kurisu: Yes. You claimed to have seen me die. I came to see if that was the truth, or just a pathetic excuse to grope me. I came for the answer.
