Rintaro: "So you’re here to see me, is that it?"
Kurisu: "Yes. You claimed to have seen me die. I came to see if that was the truth, or just a pathetic excuse to grope me. I came for the answer."
UNSPOKEN: Now that she mentions it, she did treat me like I was a perv yesterday. Well... I suppose I should be grateful that she didn’t call the cops on me after what I did. But what choice did I have? Anybody would react the same way if a dead person reappeared before them. Right?
Kurisu: "But your current behavior is all the answer I need. It was all an act to grope me. My initial hypothesis was correct."
Rintaro: "Not so fast. There’s more to this than you know."
UNSPOKEN: I must clear my name, or I’ll be labeled as a perv forever!
Kurisu: "Anyway, let’s put that aside for now."
Rintaro: "R-really?"
UNSPOKEN: That’s a relief. I was sure she was going to call the police. But that for now part bothers me. Kurisu enters the development room with a quick, confident stride. Even though she’s only 18, she’s got a decent figure and good posture. Not much in the chest, though! Her presence seems to fill the cramped room, driving me and Daru to the corners. Can’t she tell this area’s off limits!?
Kurisu: "I haven’t properly introduced myself yet, have I? I’m Makise Kurisu. Pleased to meet you."
UNSPOKEN: She holds out her hand. What is she trying to do? Shoot lightning from her fingertips!?
Kurisu: "You can’t even shake hands? Are all Japanese men this difficult?"
UNSPOKEN: Shake hands? This girl genius is asking for a handshake? We only met yesterday, and just moments ago she was on the verge of calling the cops.
Rintaro: "You’re not Japanese!?"
Kurisu: "I’ve lived in America for seven years. What about it?"
Rintaro: "America..."
UNSPOKEN: I look down at her slender fingers. Glossy, healthy fingernails. No unnecessary nail polish. I stare, fixated. Slowly, I extend my hand, making sure to keep enough weight on my heels so I can flee at a moment’s notice. I lightly grab the tip of Kurisu’s index finger between my thumb and index finger, then instantly let go.
Kurisu: "What’s your problem?"
Rintaro: "I can feel your aura of malice. You must be a powerful kung-fu master."
Kurisu: "Don’t be ridiculous."
Rintaro: "Then you’re a NINJA--"
Kurisu: "Give it a rest."
UNSPOKEN: Damn. She’s completely cold. Her tone gets scary sometimes, too.
Rintaro: "If you grew up in America, shouldn’t you say ’HAHAHA! NICE TO MEET YOU!’ with a smile across your whole face when asking for a handshake? No, wait, you should be asking for a hug, right?"
UNSPOKEN: Perhaps that’s too much to expect from a killing machine.
Kurisu: "What kind of stereotype is that?"
