Rintaro: Not so fast. There's more to this than you know.
UNSPOKEN: I must clear my name, or I'll be labeled as a perv forever!
Kurisu: Anyway, let's put that aside for now.
Rintaro: R-really?
UNSPOKEN: That's a relief. I was sure she was going to call the police. But that for now part bothers me. Kurisu enters the development room with a quick, confident stride. Even though she's only 18, she's got a decent figure and good posture. Not much in the chest, though! Her presence seems to fill the cramped room, driving me and Daru to the corners. Can't she tell this area's off limits!?
Kurisu: I haven't properly introduced myself yet, have I? I'm Makise Kurisu. Pleased to meet you.
UNSPOKEN: She holds out her hand. What is she trying to do? Shoot lightning from her fingertips!?
Kurisu: You can't even shake hands? Are all Japanese men this difficult?
UNSPOKEN: Shake hands? This girl genius is asking for a handshake? We only met yesterday, and just moments ago she was on the verge of calling the cops.
Rintaro: You're not Japanese!?
Kurisu: I've lived in America for seven years. What about it?
Rintaro: America...
UNSPOKEN: I look down at her slender fingers. Glossy, healthy fingernails. No unnecessary nail polish. I stare, fixated. Slowly, I extend my hand, making sure to keep enough weight on my heels so I can flee at a moment's notice. I lightly grab the tip of Kurisu's index finger between my thumb and index finger, then instantly let go.
Kurisu: What's your problem?
Rintaro: I can feel your aura of malice. You must be a powerful kung-fu master.
Kurisu: Don't be ridiculous.
Rintaro: Then you're a NINJA--
Kurisu: Give it a rest.
UNSPOKEN: Damn. She's completely cold. Her tone gets scary sometimes, too.
Rintaro: If you grew up in America, shouldn't you say 'HAHAHA! NICE TO MEET YOU!' with a smile across your whole face when asking for a handshake? No, wait, you should be asking for a hug, right?
UNSPOKEN: Perhaps that's too much to expect from a killing machine.
Kurisu: What kind of stereotype is that?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu sighs. She's not even looking at me. Instead, she's staring at the bananas next to the PhoneWave (name subject to change). The bananas which have just exhibited a most unusual phenomenon. Of the bunch, one has been completely gelified.
Kurisu: ...Fascinating.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu brings her face closer to it to get a good look.
Kurisu: Have any forceps?
Rintaro: No!
Kurisu: Oh.
UNSPOKEN: And then, Kurisu stabs the gelatinous banana with her index finger. She buries her beautiful fingertip knuckle-deep into slimy banana.
Rintaro: What are you doing!? That's precious data!
Kurisu: It's squishy.
