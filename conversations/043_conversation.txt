UNSPOKEN: Kurisu brings her face closer to it to get a good look.
Kurisu: "Have any forceps?"
Rintaro: "No!"
Kurisu: "Oh."
UNSPOKEN: And then, Kurisu stabs the gelatinous banana with her index finger. She buries her beautiful fingertip knuckle-deep into slimy banana.
Rintaro: "What are you doing!? That’s precious data!"
Kurisu: "It’s squishy."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu extracts her finger. Pieces of gel cling to her fingertip. She puts that fingertip into her mouth without any hesitation.
Kurisu: "...No taste. Gross."
UNSPOKEN: She says it with a straight face.
Rintaro: "You have quite the appetite, I see. A side-effect of the resurrection, perhaps? If you’re that hungry, I guess I could give you a banana or two!"
Kurisu: "No thanks."
Itaru: "Either way, those bananas are Mayushii’s."
Rintaro: "Come, don’t be shy. This is an offering. Take it!"
Kurisu: "As if. Who would eat some perv’s banana?"
Itaru: "A perv’s banana...!"
UNSPOKEN: Daru starts shaking as if he’s been electrocuted. What? What’s wrong?
Itaru: "Eat... a perv’s banana... squishy... finger in mouth... ’Gross!’ with a sour expression..."
UNSPOKEN: Looks like his cranial pervert processor is overclocking.
Itaru: "Um, can you say that one more time? With a more humiliated expression, if you please."
Kurisu: "Huh?"
Itaru: "Come on. Say, ’Who would eat some perv’s banana?’ but if you could add an, ’Ahh, but it’s so...’ after that, it would be extra delicious!"
Kurisu: "Huh? ...huh? ...Ah!!"
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Kurisu’s face turns bright red.
Rintaro: "Muhaha! Oh, Daru. You may be a worthless, disgusting perv, but let me say, well done, sir!"
UNSPOKEN: Payback is sweet! Now to follow up for maximum combo! Let’s show this conceited little girl how true adults fight!
Rintaro: "So, Makise Kurisu. You just imagined something, didn’t you? By all means, tell us what. Don’t be shy. Muhahaha!"
Kurisu: "Why you..."
Rintaro: "Come on! Say it, genius girl! What’s the imagination of a genius like? I’d love to hear from you!"
Kurisu: "You... ass!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu turns her back to us with perked shoulders. Looks like she’s capable of expressing human emotion after all. That rules out robotic killing machine. Ah! I feel refreshed. I haven’t felt this good in years. Way to go, Daru. That’s my right-hand man! Always gets the job done.
Kurisu: "I get it. You’re both pervs."
Itaru: "Well... you could say that."
UNSPOKEN: Don’t admit it, you idiot.
Rintaro: "I don’t want to hear that from you."
Kurisu: "Okay! If I came off as a little rude, I apologize."
