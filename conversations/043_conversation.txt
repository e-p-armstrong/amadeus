UNSPOKEN: She says it with a straight face.
Rintaro: You have quite the appetite, I see. A side-effect of the resurrection, perhaps? If you're that hungry, I guess I could give you a banana or two!
Kurisu: No thanks.
Itaru: Either way, those bananas are Mayushii's.
Rintaro: Come, don't be shy. This is an offering. Take it!
Kurisu: As if. Who would eat some perv's banana?
Itaru: A perv's banana...!
UNSPOKEN: Daru starts shaking as if he's been electrocuted. What? What's wrong?
Itaru: Eat... a perv's banana... squishy... finger in mouth... 'Gross!' with a sour expression...
UNSPOKEN: Looks like his cranial pervert processor is overclocking.
Itaru: Um, can you say that one more time? With a more humiliated expression, if you please.
Kurisu: Huh?
Itaru: Come on. Say, 'Who would eat some perv's banana?' but if you could add an, 'Ahh, but it's so...' after that, it would be extra delicious!
Kurisu: Huh? ...huh? ...Ah!!
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Kurisu's face turns bright red.
Rintaro: Muhaha! Oh, Daru. You may be a worthless, disgusting perv, but let me say, well done, sir!
UNSPOKEN: Payback is sweet! Now to follow up for maximum combo! Let's show this conceited little girl how true adults fight!
Rintaro: So, Makise Kurisu. You just imagined something, didn't you? By all means, tell us what. Don't be shy. Muhahaha!
Kurisu: Why you...
Rintaro: Come on! Say it, genius girl! What's the imagination of a genius like? I'd love to hear from you!
Kurisu: You... ass!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu turns her back to us with perked shoulders. Looks like she's capable of expressing human emotion after all. That rules out robotic killing machine. Ah! I feel refreshed. I haven't felt this good in years. Way to go, Daru. That's my right-hand man! Always gets the job done.
Kurisu: I get it. You're both pervs.
Itaru: Well... you could say that.
UNSPOKEN: Don't admit it, you idiot.
Rintaro: I don't want to hear that from you.
Kurisu: Okay! If I came off as a little rude, I apologize.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu sighs deeply and turns back to us. Her composure has already returned.
Kurisu: I was only acting that way because you molested me, but I'll ignore that for now.
UNSPOKEN: I wish she would stop saying for now. It's like she's gonna call the cops on me later.
Kurisu: Please tell me what happened to this banana. I'd also like to hear about that...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu glances at the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Kurisu: That microwave thing.
Rintaro: That's top secret. The one thing I'm cleared to share with unauthorized individuals is that its name is the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Kurisu: Name subject to change? What's that about?
Rintaro: PhoneWave is weak. It needs a better name.
Kurisu: I couldn't care less about its name.
