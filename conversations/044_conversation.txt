Itaru: Hold on, Okarin. Makise-shi might be able to explain what's going on.
Rintaro: Hmm... well...
UNSPOKEN: She is a genius. She would have to be to defeat my sharp wit. We can trust her intellect, at least. But it's hard to stomach her attitude. Plus, she has danger written on her face. Not to mention, she's a little scary too. Then, I get a great idea.
Kurisu: That creepy grin... are you thinking perverted thoughts again?
Rintaro: You said your name's Christina, right?
Kurisu: Who the hell's Christina!? I never said that!
UNSPOKEN: 'Christina' sounds like the name of a Hollywood film star. It definitely has more flavor than her real name.
Rintaro: If you wish to learn the secrets of this microwave, then you must meet my conditions.
Kurisu: ...Which are?
Rintaro: Condition One: You must become a lab mem.
Kurisu: Ramen?
Rintaro: No! Lab mem, stupid! Short for laboratory member!
Kurisu: You mean you want me to join your research team? I'm supposed to return to America in August.
Rintaro: I'll have you sign a non-disclosure agreement so you won't betray our secrets. Break the agreement, and I'll report your steamy, perverted acts to Science Magazine.
Kurisu: Gh...
Itaru: You're a monster, Okarin. I'll take five copies.
Rintaro: From the moment you become a lab mem to the moment of your departure, your brain shall be used for the benefit of our lab.
Kurisu: You're so full of it. Let's see the contract, then.
Rintaro: What contract? This is a lab, not a corporation!
Kurisu: I don't mind lending you my knowledge, but if there is more pervy nonsense involved, the answer is NO.
Rintaro: Don't worry, we don't bite.
Kurisu: No more molestation?
Rintaro: No, alright!?
Kurisu: You said that was condition one. So there's gotta be a second one, right? It better not be--
Rintaro: The second condition is... That you'll overlook all past acts of molestation I may or may not have committed!
Itaru: Okarin, you're so petty! You're the pettiest person I've ever met! That's why we love you! That's why we admire you!
Rintaro: Shut up, Daru. You have no right to talk. By the way, Daru's perverted acts aren't included. You two can work it out yourselves.
Itaru: What the hell, man!
Rintaro: Those are the conditions! If you can't accept them, then you must leave at once! Heh heh heh. So what'll it be? I don't think it's a bad deal at all.
Kurisu: You mean for you.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu puts her fingers to her brow and shakes her head in an exaggerated gesture.
Kurisu: Geez... I feel like I'm hypersecreting noradrenaline. Let me pick my jaw up off the floor.
Rintaro: I don't care about your dislocated jaw! Do you accept the conditions or not? Answer me, Christina!
Kurisu: Stop adding -tina! My name's Kurisu!
