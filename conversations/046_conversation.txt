Itaru: "Nope."
UNSPOKEN: Any second now, the gelified banana should reappear on the stem. If it only happens once, we can just call it an accident and be done with it. But if it happens twice, then that’s proof that something’s actually going on.  And then, Kurisu will have to admit that I, the great Hououin Kyouma, have invented humanity’s first teleporter! I keep staring at the bananas in anticipation.
Kurisu: "100 seconds."
UNSPOKEN: A few moments after Kurisu’s report--
Itaru: "Ah!"
UNSPOKEN: A gelbana suddenly appears without a sound. Now there are two of them on the bunch. It happened faster than the blink of an eye.
Itaru: "It appeared!"
UNSPOKEN: I’m at a loss for words. I just witnessed the unthinkable. This phenomenon is clearly teleportation. The microwave timer chimes. Kurisu peeks into the microwave, stumped.
Rintaro: "How does it look?"
Kurisu: "Huh? Oh... uh... A-at 104 seconds, it d-disappeared. Abruptly. Yeah."
UNSPOKEN: She’s quite flustered. I don’t think many people could remain calm after witnessing such a phenomenon.
Rintaro: "So it is a teleporter! The first in human history!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu quickly calms down. She furrows her brow and crosses her arms, tapping her right foot as she mutters to herself.
Kurisu: "Teleportation... is that even possible? It did move... No matter how unbelievable that may be... Could it be quantum teleportation... no, that only occurs on the quantum level..."
Rintaro: "Don’t avert your eyes from the truth! What you’ve seen with your own eyes is everything!"
UNSPOKEN: She gives me a sharp look. Her eyes are like a sniper’s, hard and keen.
Kurisu: "Did it really teleport? It’s dangerous to reason from the conclusion."
Rintaro: "Well then, genius girl, what do you call this phenomenon?"
Kurisu: "Let’s sort this out. Neither the banana bunch nor the frozen chicken teleported. Correct?"
Rintaro: "...So, maybe there’s a size limit for objects that can teleport."
Kurisu: "But aren’t those chicken pieces smaller than bananas?"
Rintaro: "We used the same chicken for each experiment. They come in 12-packs."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri only buys her favorite: Juicy Chicken Number One.
Itaru: "That’s quite a lot, then."
Kurisu: "What about salt? You experimented with salt too, right?"
UNSPOKEN: We used a handful of table salt on a plate for one experiment. Nothing happened.
Kurisu: "Maybe the plate was in the way."
Rintaro: "Of course we tried it without the plate, but that didn’t change anything."
Kurisu: "Then, maybe each individual grain of salt was too small... or something? Hmm... I need a clue..."
UNSPOKEN: Looks like our genius girl’s fighting a hard battle. She starts pacing the room, looking a little annoyed.
Kurisu: "Anything else? Have you noticed anything else about the PhoneWave?"
Rintaro: "Not PhoneWave. PhoneWave (name subject to change)."
Kurisu: "Forget about that. So? Have you noticed anything or not?"
