Rintaro: How does it look?
Kurisu: Huh? Oh... uh... A-at 104 seconds, it d-disappeared. Abruptly. Yeah.
UNSPOKEN: She's quite flustered. I don't think many people could remain calm after witnessing such a phenomenon.
Rintaro: So it is a teleporter! The first in human history!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu quickly calms down. She furrows her brow and crosses her arms, tapping her right foot as she mutters to herself.
Kurisu: Teleportation... is that even possible? It did move... No matter how unbelievable that may be... Could it be quantum teleportation... no, that only occurs on the quantum level...
Rintaro: Don't avert your eyes from the truth! What you've seen with your own eyes is everything!
UNSPOKEN: She gives me a sharp look. Her eyes are like a sniper's, hard and keen.
Kurisu: Did it really teleport? It's dangerous to reason from the conclusion.
Rintaro: Well then, genius girl, what do you call this phenomenon?
Kurisu: Let's sort this out. Neither the banana bunch nor the frozen chicken teleported. Correct?
Rintaro: ...So, maybe there's a size limit for objects that can teleport.
Kurisu: But aren't those chicken pieces smaller than bananas?
Rintaro: We used the same chicken for each experiment. They come in 12-packs.
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri only buys her favorite: Juicy Chicken Number One.
Itaru: That's quite a lot, then.
Kurisu: What about salt? You experimented with salt too, right?
UNSPOKEN: We used a handful of table salt on a plate for one experiment. Nothing happened.
Kurisu: Maybe the plate was in the way.
Rintaro: Of course we tried it without the plate, but that didn't change anything.
Kurisu: Then, maybe each individual grain of salt was too small... or something? Hmm... I need a clue...
UNSPOKEN: Looks like our genius girl's fighting a hard battle. She starts pacing the room, looking a little annoyed.
Kurisu: Anything else? Have you noticed anything else about the PhoneWave?
Rintaro: Not PhoneWave. PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Kurisu: Forget about that. So? Have you noticed anything or not?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's looking at Daru. Looks like she's asking him, not me. True, he should know more about the PhoneWave (name subject to change) than I do. He's done all the maintenance on it, after all.
Itaru: Oh, right! One time, it shot off a huge electrical discharge.
Rintaro: What!? I don't know anything about that!
Itaru: That's because you weren't around when it happened.
Kurisu: Discharge? How much?
Itaru: It was like a fluorescent light lit up the development room. It lasted about two seconds, I guess.
Kurisu: What were the circumstances?
Itaru: I was adjusting the cellphone attached to it. I unhooked it and put my own in. A little bit later, sparky sparky.
Rintaro: When was that?
Itaru: Around noon yesterday. When you went to see Doctor Nakabachi's presentation.
Kurisu: Doctor Nakabachi...
