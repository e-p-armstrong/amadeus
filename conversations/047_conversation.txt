Rintaro: "What!? I don’t know anything about that!"
Itaru: "That’s because you weren’t around when it happened."
Kurisu: "Discharge? How much?"
Itaru: "It was like a fluorescent light lit up the development room. It lasted about two seconds, I guess."
Kurisu: "What were the circumstances?"
Itaru: "I was adjusting the cellphone attached to it. I unhooked it and put my own in. A little bit later, sparky sparky."
Rintaro: "When was that?"
Itaru: "Around noon yesterday. When you went to see Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation."
Kurisu: "Doctor Nakabachi..."
UNSPOKEN: That’s right. I went to see Doctor Nakabachi’s conference yesterday. Come to think of it, he stole his time travel theory from John Titor. Maybe the current John Titor is actually Nakabachi.
Rintaro: "But wait, Daru. Didn’t you say that Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation was cancelled?"
Itaru: "Yeah, but you went with Mayu-shi anyway, remember?"
UNSPOKEN: ...No, I don’t remember that. After all, Nakabachi’s presentation wasn’t canceled, the way I remember it. I still don’t understand why my memories seem to disagree with everyone else’s.
Rintaro: "That reminds me. I sent you an email back then. Did you get it?"
Itaru: "An email?"
Kurisu: "That email you showed me at ATF yesterday?"
UNSPOKEN: When I nod, Kurisu comes closer.
Kurisu: "It said someone stabbed me at the presentation, didn’t it?"
Rintaro: "Yeah. But for some reason, Daru’s phone received it a week ago..."
Itaru: "Huh? Wasn’t that one of your stories? If it wasn’t, then that would make the timestamp weird."
Rintaro: "I always speak the truth! If you don’t trust me, I’ll show you my send history."
UNSPOKEN: I whip out my phone and call up the history. But--
Rintaro: "It’s gone..."
UNSPOKEN: Not a trace of that mail remains. According to my memory, I think it was about 30 minutes after Doctor Nakabachi’s conference. About ten people including me saw Kurisu’s body, panicked, and fled Radi-Kan. That’s when I sent that mail. But no matter how many times I check, there’s no record of it. It should be there, but it isn’t. Just like the banana inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Rintaro: "Where did it go? I could’ve sworn I sent it just before 1 PM."
Itaru: "Oh yeah! That’s when the discharge phenomenon happened! The show I was watching was about to end."
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, a flash of inspiration strikes. Inspiration! Edison would be proud. This isn’t something you can accomplish with effort. Basically, I’m a genius! I turn to Daru and Kurisu with a huge grin on my face.
Rintaro: "I get it... So that’s what happened."
Kurisu: "Uh, what?"
Itaru: "Oh, this is one of Okarin’s usual habits, so don’t mind it. Seriously."
Rintaro: "Silence! I’ve reached the answer, and now the world will tremble!"
