Itaru: Yeah, but you went with Mayu-shi anyway, remember?
UNSPOKEN: ...No, I don't remember that. After all, Nakabachi's presentation wasn't canceled, the way I remember it. I still don't understand why my memories seem to disagree with everyone else's.
Rintaro: That reminds me. I sent you an email back then. Did you get it?
Itaru: An email?
Kurisu: That email you showed me at ATF yesterday?
UNSPOKEN: When I nod, Kurisu comes closer.
Kurisu: It said someone stabbed me at the presentation, didn't it?
Rintaro: Yeah. But for some reason, Daru's phone received it a week ago...
Itaru: Huh? Wasn't that one of your stories? If it wasn't, then that would make the timestamp weird.
Rintaro: I always speak the truth! If you don't trust me, I'll show you my send history.
UNSPOKEN: I whip out my phone and call up the history. But--
Rintaro: It's gone...
UNSPOKEN: Not a trace of that mail remains. According to my memory, I think it was about 30 minutes after Doctor Nakabachi's conference. About ten people including me saw Kurisu's body, panicked, and fled Radi-Kan. That's when I sent that mail. But no matter how many times I check, there's no record of it. It should be there, but it isn't. Just like the banana inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Rintaro: Where did it go? I could've sworn I sent it just before 1 PM.
Itaru: Oh yeah! That's when the discharge phenomenon happened! The show I was watching was about to end.
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, a flash of inspiration strikes. Inspiration! Edison would be proud. This isn't something you can accomplish with effort. Basically, I'm a genius! I turn to Daru and Kurisu with a huge grin on my face.
Rintaro: I get it... So that's what happened.
Kurisu: Uh, what?
Itaru: Oh, this is one of Okarin's usual habits, so don't mind it. Seriously.
Rintaro: Silence! I've reached the answer, and now the world will tremble!
UNSPOKEN: I slap the top of the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Rintaro: The disappearance of my mail, the strange timestamp, and the sudden electrical discharge must be... Related somehow!
Kurisu: ...And?
Rintaro: Huh?
Kurisu: I understand that they're related somehow. But how?
Rintaro: It's your job to figure that out, Christina.
Kurisu: Hashida-san, talking to this guy's so tiring.
Itaru: Everyone's like that at first. The trick is to not take him seriously.
Rintaro: And you call yourself my right-hand man!?
UNSPOKEN: Whatever. I'll prove that I'm right. If we can reproduce the electrical discharge phenomenon, it should bring us closer to understanding the timestamp mystery.
Rintaro: Daru, describe the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s status when the discharge phenomenon occurred.
Itaru: It was kind of a mess. I'd connected my phone to the PhoneWave, and I was testing to see if I could control it with the X68000.
