Rintaro: "The disappearance of my mail, the strange timestamp, and the sudden electrical discharge must be... Related somehow!"
Kurisu: "...And?"
Rintaro: "Huh?"
Kurisu: "I understand that they’re related somehow. But how?"
Rintaro: "It’s your job to figure that out, Christina."
Kurisu: "Hashida-san, talking to this guy’s so tiring."
Itaru: "Everyone’s like that at first. The trick is to not take him seriously."
Rintaro: "And you call yourself my right-hand man!?"
UNSPOKEN: Whatever. I’ll prove that I’m right. If we can reproduce the electrical discharge phenomenon, it should bring us closer to understanding the timestamp mystery.
Rintaro: "Daru, describe the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s status when the discharge phenomenon occurred."
Itaru: "It was kind of a mess. I’d connected my phone to the PhoneWave, and I was testing to see if I could control it with the X68000."
UNSPOKEN: I disconnect the phone plugged into the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and replace it with mine. And then I hear the door open in the lounge.
Mayuri: "I’m home! So hungry..."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri comes in carrying a convenience store bag. Looks like she’s done with work.
Mayuri: "Time to eat some chicken! Juicy Chicken Number One♪ Okarin, did you buy the bananas? Okarin?"
UNSPOKEN: When she enters the development room, her eyes go wide.
Mayuri: "Huh? We have a guest?"
UNSPOKEN: Once she notices Kurisu, Mayuri bows her head with her usual smile.
Mayuri: "I’m Mayushii. Nice to meet you!"
Kurisu: "I’m Makise. Apparently, I’m a lab mem now."
Mayuri: "Really? That’s great! Another girl lab mem!"
Rintaro: "Daru, what were you doing with the X68000?"
Itaru: "Like I said, I was adjusting the incoming mail settings. I was monitoring the moment it received mail for remote control. That’s why I put it on ’freezing mode’ for 120 seconds too. I made it so that you can start freezing mode by computer. I tested that out yesterday too."
Rintaro: "Mayuri! Insert the Juicy Chicken Number One into the PhoneWave (name subject to change)!"
Mayuri: "You all want some? I can give you one each."
UNSPOKEN: With her usual ditziness, Mayuri puts the chicken inside the microwave. Daru explains what everything on the computer monitor means. Doesn’t look that different from using DOS. I enter 120# on the keyboard and strike the enter key. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) starts up. The Juicy Chicken Number One starts spinning backwards on the turntable. Kurisu stares hard at the PhoneWave (name subject to change), as if to not let any anomaly, no matter how slight, escape her notice.
Rintaro: "So, we’ve reproduced the conditions that existed when the discharge phenomenon occurred. Right?"
Itaru: "Uhh, how was it again..."
Rintaro: "You there. Assistant!"
Kurisu: "Huh? Me?"
Rintaro: "Who else!?"
Kurisu: "When did I become your assistant!?"
Rintaro: "Just send something to my phone!"
