Kurisu: "I don’t even know your email address."
Rintaro: "What a useless assistant."
Kurisu: "Don’t call me your assistant!"
Rintaro: "Daru, send an email from your phone!"
Itaru: "Uh, sure... but what?"
Rintaro: "Anything!"
Itaru: "Uhh, umm..."
Rintaro: "Send ’Christina’s a perv’!"
Kurisu: "I thought we agreed to stop saying that!"
Itaru: "Well, let’s compromise and go with ’Okarin’s a perv’."
Rintaro: "You traitor!"
Kurisu: "Good job, Hashida-san!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu grins and gives Daru a thumbs up. I really don’t like this.
Mayuri: "Oh no! Mayushii’s bananas!"
UNSPOKEN: It sounds like Mayuri has found the results of our latest experiment.
Mayuri: "They became gelbanas..."
Kurisu: "We experimented on them."
Mayuri: "But they were Mayushii’s..."
Itaru: "Want me to send the mail now?"
Kurisu: "You’ll be reimbursed later. By Hououin-san, that is."
Rintaro: "Why me!?"
Mayuri: "Geez! Why do you always have to experiment on Mayushii’s food? Ah! Don’t tell me you’re experimenting on the chicken too?"
Rintaro: "We are."
Itaru: "’Kay, sending it now. Sending, sending, click."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri slips past me and steps up to the active PhoneWave (name subject to change). Before anyone can react, she grabs the handle--
Rintaro: "Wait! Don’t open that!"
Mayuri: "Huh?"
UNSPOKEN: But it’s too late.
Mayuri: "Wawah!"
UNSPOKEN: Blue-white light fills the room, crackling angrily like the heart of a storm.
Kurisu: "An electrical discharge!"
UNSPOKEN: A violent sparking sound. I grab Mayuri and pull her away from the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Itaru: "Are we gonna die!?"
UNSPOKEN: A thin cloud of smoke fills the room. It smells like something’s burning. My eyes are numb from all the flashing light. I try blinking several times to regain my sight. I can hear Kurisu and Daru coughing.
Rintaro: "E-everyone okay?"
Itaru: "S-somehow."
Kurisu: "That was definitely more than two seconds."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri squeezes my upper arm with her slender fingers.
Mayuri: "O-Okarin? Umm, what just happened?"
UNSPOKEN: My vision gradually returns. Mayuri looks perplexed.
Rintaro: "Are you okay? No burns or anything?"
Mayuri: "Hmm... It doesn’t hurt anywhere, so I think I’m okay..."
UNSPOKEN: Looks like covering Mayuri was the right choice. I may be an insane mad scientist, but I still risk life and limb for the safety of my comrades. I gently let Mayuri out of my embrace. Whew. Well, that was something. I wipe the sweat off my brow.
Kurisu: "H-hey! Look at this!"
