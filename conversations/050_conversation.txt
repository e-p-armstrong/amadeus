UNSPOKEN: Mayuri stands up and looks inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change). It's embedded in the floor, but she somehow manages to pry the door open.
Mayuri: Ahh! M-Mayushii's chicken is all burnt black...
UNSPOKEN: I pat Mayuri's shoulders to cheer her up.
Rintaro: Juicy Chicken Number One made a noble sacrifice for the progress of science. Let us pray for his happiness in the next life.
Kurisu: The chicken doesn't matter! Right now, we need to determine what happened with the Phonewa--
Mayuri: It doesn't matter? That's so mean, uh, Christina-chan...
Kurisu: Hey, Hououin Kyouma! Do something about this! Mayushii-san learned my name wrong!
Itaru: More importantly, we need ventilation. *cough cough*
Rintaro: Silence, all of you!
UNSPOKEN: I affix everyone with an overpowering stare. This shall be remembered as the moment that the greatest experiment of the century succeeded and brought humanity a step forward in a new direction. These guys have no right to ruin that with their foolish talk. My heart pounding, I detach my phone from the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Luckily, it's completely unharmed. I open it. It still works. I bring up the list of received emails. New emails should come at the top. However... My heart beats even faster. The topmost email isn't the one Daru sent before the discharge occurred. This impossible phenomenon is exactly what I was hoping for. I look back through my email history. And there... I find it.
Rintaro: Muhaha! Muhahaha! MUHAHAHAHA!
UNSPOKEN: Success. I don't know why, but it was a success! The timestamp proves it. I received this email on July 24th -- five days ago. This is the same exact thing that happened to my someone stabbed Kurisu email. A mail sent on the 29th arrived on the 24th. And just now, the truth was revealed to me in a flash of inspiration.
Rintaro: It all connects. There's a meaning behind this series of events, and only one true answer. I've discovered the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s true hidden function! This isn't intuition. That's right. This is conviction!
Kurisu: Just spit it out. What do you think it is?
UNSPOKEN: I feel my lips twist into a grin. I meet Kurisu's glare head on.
Rintaro: First, let me say one thing. The greatest inventions are created by accident. This we call serendipity.
Kurisu: Get on with it.
UNSPOKEN: How dare she ruin my speech? Oh well. Let's get to the point.
Rintaro: The mail was sent to the past. The chicken returned to its frozen state. The plucked banana returned to the bunch.
Kurisu: ...No way.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu seems to get it now. As expected of my genius assistant.
Rintaro: Yes way!
UNSPOKEN: This is the choice of Steins Gate.
Rintaro: The PhoneWave (name subject to change)... Is a time machine!
