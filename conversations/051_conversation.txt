UNSPOKEN: I feel my lips twist into a grin. I meet Kurisu’s glare head on.
Rintaro: "First, let me say one thing. The greatest inventions are created by accident. This we call serendipity."
Kurisu: "Get on with it."
UNSPOKEN: How dare she ruin my speech? Oh well. Let’s get to the point.
Rintaro: "The mail was sent to the past. The chicken returned to its frozen state. The plucked banana returned to the bunch."

UNSPOKEN: The dawn of a new day. Actually, it’s already noon. We didn’t sleep at all. Sleep deprivation makes the summer sun seem all the brighter. I really don’t want to go outside, but I’m fed up with the humidity inside the lab. I chug a bottle of Dr P. My stomach protests. Maybe I drank too fast. I’m exhausted. My hands are shaking slightly, and my vision is cloudy. I could pass out if I’m not careful. Maybe I should take a shower. That should stave off exhaustion, if only temporarily.

Outside is a sunny summer afternoon. But inside the air is stale and empty of life. Yesterday, that shocking experiment convinced me that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) was also a time machine. But Kurisu didn’t seem willing to accept the results. She just started screaming,
