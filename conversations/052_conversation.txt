UNSPOKEN: Moeka complies. I registered her as Lab Mem Number 005 just a bit earlier. It was a choice between letting her leak word of the time machine or forcing her to join our group. I reluctantly choose the latter.
Rintaro: Kuh... I've gone soft. The old me would have killed her without a second thought.
UNSPOKEN: Moeka is standing right next to me, but my monologue has no effect. Looks like she wants to ask me something.
Rintaro: What is it?
Moeka: ...Is it really a time machine?
Rintaro: Yes. You'll see. But you can't tell anyone. Okay?
UNSPOKEN: Moeka nods.
Itaru: Alright, program complete.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu, lying on the sofa, looks up from the technical manual she was reading. She got here about thirty minutes ago.
Kurisu: Then lets resume the experiments.
Mayuri: But won't the manager scold us again?
Rintaro: Heh, don't worry. Yesterday, I made this promise with Mister Braun. 'I swear there won't be any more shaking today.' In other words, the no-shaking promise only applied yesterday, so since today is yesterday's tomorrow, we can shake it all we want!
Kurisu: That doesn't settle anything. Why you're so confident is a mystery to me.
Rintaro: In other words, Christina, you want me to erase Mister Braun.
Kurisu: No! Besides, I don't think a wimp like you stands a chance against him.
