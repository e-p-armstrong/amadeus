Itaru: "Nah, too much trouble..."
Rintaro: "Aren’t you hungry?"
Itaru: "Yeah, but..."
Rintaro: "Hmph. You’re such a bum."
UNSPOKEN: What is doing on the computer anyway? I’m curious, so I casually peek over his shoulder. There’s an image of a futuristic-looking facility I’ve never seen before. Richly-colored cords crawl through a gigantic octagonal tunnel, like the interior of a spaceship from a sci-fi movie. Based on the height of the people in the picture, the tunnel looks to be more than ten meters tall. Incidentally, the people don’t look Japanese.
Itaru: "Haa..."
UNSPOKEN: Daru sighs heartily. I don’t know if the blank look in his eyes is from sleepiness, exhaustion, or if something’s just wrong with him.
Itaru: "The Large Hadron Collider sure is cute..."
Rintaro: "W-what!? What did you just say!?"
UNSPOKEN: Large Hardon Colliander? Is that an incantation? No -- a secret technique!?
Itaru: "Large Hadron Collider. You don’t know about it?"
UNSPOKEN: I grab Daru’s relaxed shoulders and wring them out.
Itaru: "Owowowowowow, what are you doing!?"
Rintaro: "Are you conscious?"
Itaru: "Of course, man."
Rintaro: "What is this Large Hadron Collider thing?"
Itaru: "You know. It’s what SERN uses to do their experiments. LHC for short. It’s seriously moe. Recommended."
Rintaro: "You’re lusting for something that’s not even humanoid?"
Itaru: "Of course not. But there’s something about it that gets me excited, you know? It makes me smile, you know? Don’t you feel that?"
Rintaro: "Come to think of it, I remember you said that you found factories and the undersides of highways irresistible or something."
Itaru: "Yeah. Same thing."
Rintaro: "Where does it end?"
UNSPOKEN: 2D, 3D, and even inanimate objects...
Itaru: "Life’s too short. I don’t want to limit my interests, you know?"
UNSPOKEN: And yet, you’ll do anything to avoid things that don’t interest you. Hypocrite.
Rintaro: "SERN..."
UNSPOKEN: That name... I’ve seen it somewhere, and recently. Where was it again? Oh, of course.
Rintaro: "John Titor!"
Itaru: "Oh yeah. That guy you mentioned earlier. He’s the guy @channel’s going crazy about, isn’t he?"
Rintaro: "That one might be an impostor. I was talking about the John Titor who appeared ten years ago."
Itaru: "He appeared ten years ago? The same guy?"
UNSPOKEN: I had hope that Daru would remember, but no such luck.
Rintaro: "Anyway, John Titor mentioned SERN."
UNSPOKEN: I don’t remember all of it, but there’s one thing I’m sure of.
Rintaro: "Titor made a prediction. Namely, that before the year 2034, SERN will develop a time machine!"
Itaru: "A time machine? That’s a timely topic. But that wasn’t just ten years ago. This new Titor said the same thing."
Rintaro: "It doesn’t matter if it was ten years ago or ten seconds ago. That’s not the point, Daru. This coincidence could very well be the choice of Steins Gate!"
