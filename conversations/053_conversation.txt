UNSPOKEN: I put away my phone, then turn to find Daru giving me an exasperated look.
Itaru: Just who the hell are you fighting with?
Rintaro: Daru, I know what we must do.
Itaru: Whuzzat?
Rintaro: Don't you 'whuzzat' me! You're supposed to grin like you know exactly what I'm talking about! What kind of super hacka are you!?
UNSPOKEN: I wanted him to say something like Well, why the hell not. So, what's in it for me? And then we'd continue like this, grinning slyly the whole time: Or something like that. Yup, a real cool conversation. But the real-world Daru just purses his lips.
Itaru: You always give such half-baked explanations. Try to sound intelligible before you try to sound intelligent.
UNSPOKEN: Work with me here!
Rintaro: You are a super hacka.
Itaru: Stop saying hacka. At least say hacker.
Rintaro: See where I'm going with this?
Itaru: No, not at all.
Rintaro: Hack into SERN.
UNSPOKEN: Daru stares at me in disbelief.
Itaru: ...Is that some kind of joke?
Rintaro: I know you can do it, Daru. Expose their dastardly deeds and find any hints you can about the time machine.
Itaru: Dastardly deeds? You're just imagining that stuff, Okarin.
Rintaro: We stand at a crossroads. Will the PhoneWave (name subject to change) become a functional time machine, or will it die as garbage in lab storage?
Itaru: You serious?
Rintaro: I'm always serious!
UNSPOKEN: I look Daru straight in the eye as I answer. Looks like that made him understand my position. Daru sweeps the garbage off his desk and sits up straight.
Itaru: I'm not responsible for the consequences, got it?
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Daru is bursting with energy. It's like his earlier lethargy was a lie.
Rintaro: Deal. Get started.
Itaru: Let's do this!
Rintaro: For your payment, I'll deposit a week's supply of potato chips into your Swiss bank account.
UNSPOKEN: Daru doesn't respond. He's already deep in concentration.
Rintaro: Anyway, I'm gonna sleep. It's all yours.
