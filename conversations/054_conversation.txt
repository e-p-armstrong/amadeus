Rintaro: What do you think? This proves that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is an honest-to-goodness time machine.
UNSPOKEN: Moeka just keeps staring at my phone.
Suzuha: Hey!
UNSPOKEN: Part-Time Warrior's voice comes from outside the window.
Suzuha: It's shaking again! And there's a strange light, too! What are you doing up there!?
UNSPOKEN: I decide to ignore her. Mister Braun is one thing, but she doesn't scare me at all.
Rintaro: Now then, lab mems.
UNSPOKEN: I assemble all the lab members, including Moeka, for a meeting.
Rintaro: The 73rd Round Table Conference will come to order.
Kurisu: Yesterday was the 66th. Where'd the other six go?
Rintaro: Only anal retentive bastards care about the minor details. That's why you'll never be more than an assistant, Christina!
Kurisu: Like I keep saying, I'm neither your assistant nor Christina.
