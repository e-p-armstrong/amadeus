Suzuha: I've got a lot more free time than I expected. I've gone out four or five times today. Figured I'd reconnoiter the front of the store, see if I couldn't spot any customers.
UNSPOKEN: Reconnoiter? Now there's a word you don't hear in casual conversation. I'm pretty sure it means to perform reconnaissance, to scout an area and gather intelligence. Is she some kind of secret agent!? I follow Suzuha into the store.
Suzuha: So that's when I heard you guys talking from the second floor. I got interested and looked it up online. Now I know all the rumors about SERN.
UNSPOKEN: Damn. We were careless. Looks like we need to close that window when we discuss sensitive matters from now on. But if we do that, the lab will turn into a scorching hell. Damned if I do, damned if I don't.
Rintaro: ...A-anyway, you must not tell anyone else.
UNSPOKEN: Or else men in black will raid us.
Suzuha: Ah, yeah. I understand. I'm actually tight lipped, so don't worry.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha grins and thumps her chest confidently. All is quiet inside the Braun Tube Workshop. That gigantic TV isn't on. Mister Braun's not here either.
Rintaro: Where's the manager?
Suzuha: He left right after he finished repairing your TV.
UNSPOKEN: He probably went to see the chipmunk. He disappears during business hours every now and then. Whenever I ask him where he's going, he always says something like I'm picking my beloved daughter up from school or My beloved daughter has a cold with a huge grin on his face. He dotes on her too much. It probably just annoys her. Anyway, just how irresponsible can you be to neglect work to see your daughter? He used to put a Back Soon sign on the door whenever he left, but now he has Suzuha to take care of things while he's gone.
Suzuha: Sooo, here's the fixed TV.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha lightly taps the TV on the counter.
Suzuha: He said to charge 1000 yen.
UNSPOKEN: Damn manager. I bet he gave it to us just so he could charge repair fees. I reluctantly take a bill out of my wallet and hand it to Suzuha. She takes out a receipt. Apparently, it was already written out.
Suzuha: Thanks for your patronage. Well, just take it away.
Rintaro: By myself? Are you joking?
Suzuha: Huh? Didn't you bring it here by yourself?
UNSPOKEN: Don't you know it takes ten times more effort to go up stairs than down? Defying gravity is no easy task, woman!
Suzuha: I guess I can help, but... oh, I see. So we're already in the age where women do physical labor.
UNSPOKEN: She mutters, her tone pensive. Tch. How sarcastic of her.
Rintaro: Hmph. I don't remember anyone asking for your help. Honestly, getting help from a girl like you would just hurt my pride.
Suzuha: Wow!
UNSPOKEN: Applause.
Suzuha: That was so manly! I might be falling for you.
Rintaro: Hmph, you think you can trick me like that? You're lying, aren't you?
