Rintaro: It's one of my powers... Coloring Gentleman.
UNSPOKEN: This power allows me to see through lies. Liars appear to glow red. Then they die.
Suzuha: Y-you have powers?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha's eyes pop, but then she clears her throat as if to hide her surprise.
Suzuha: Are you some kind of esper?
UNSPOKEN: When I nod, she whispers into my ear.
Suzuha: Are there a lot of espers like you?
Rintaro: Of course not. I am special!
UNSPOKEN: I thrust my chest out as far as possible to display my majesty.
Suzuha: Oh... You had me scared for a second there. But still, it's amazing that people like you exist. Maybe SERN is the reason there aren't more where I came from...
UNSPOKEN: After muttering some nonsense to herself, she finally nods in understanding.
Suzuha: By the way, does the ability to see through lies have any combat application at all? If it were me, I'd want perfect accuracy within a thousand meters, or ultra-fast reflexes that let me tear my enemy's limbs off before they can react.
UNSPOKEN: What the hell is she talking about? Is she a survival game otaku? No, wait. Don't tell me!
Rintaro: You... you're an Organization assassin, aren't you? You must be the one they call Miss Golgo! Who hired you!?
Suzuha: Nobody hired me. What's a Golgo?
UNSPOKEN: She's trying to gloss things over with an insincere smile. Her confusion is suspicious. That reminds me. I think I remember her saying some awfully disturbing things when we first met yesterday.
Suzuha: Anyway, do you have any other powers?
Rintaro: Even if I did, there's no way I'd tell a hitman hired to kill me.
Suzuha: I'm not going to kill you.
Rintaro: Revealing my powers would be suicide. They are most effective with the element of surprise. In other words, they're for me to know and you to find out!
Suzuha: Meanie.
Rintaro: Say what you like.
UNSPOKEN: Burning tension runs between us. Our eyes meet. Invisible sparks scatter. And then an email arrives to break the stalemate. I turn my attention away from Suzuha. This ringtone is starting to piss me off. It's most likely from that mail demon Shining Finger. I can tell without even checking. Tch, this is getting ridiculous. She's got some stalker qualities, and maybe split personalities. I shouldn't have given her my address. I look at Suzuha and see her lying on the counter. She's playing with something in the palm of her hand. It looks like a small metal pin. Anyway, how can she be this lazy on her second day? I love CRTs was a lie too, wasn't it?
Suzuha: Why the frown? Did you get a death notice?
Rintaro: A what?
Suzuha: ...J-just wondering.
UNSPOKEN: She was just wondering if I got a death notice? How can she say that with a straight face? And what the hell is a death notice anyway? Do those even exist?
Suzuha: Umm, what I meant to ask was if you got some unpleasant news.
Rintaro: ...You could say that.
