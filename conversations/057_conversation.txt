UNSPOKEN: Suzuha leaps up as soon as I speak.
Suzuha: An IBN 5100?
Rintaro: You know about them?
Suzuha: Yeah...
Rintaro: I see. So the IBN 5100 legend is famous, huh.
UNSPOKEN: Maybe that retro PC's more popular with female otaku than I thought.
Suzuha: Y-yeah, that's it. I heard the urban legend from someone. How much do you know about it?
Rintaro: I actually tried looking for an IBN 5100, but in the end, I came to the conclusion that there isn't one in Akiba.
Suzuha: ...I see. Well, that's true.
Rintaro: You sound like you know something.
Suzuha: Eh? Well, I do and I don't, I guess. I don't know about it personally, but I happened to hear about it from a knowledgeable acquaintance of mine or something like that. Aha, ahaha.
UNSPOKEN: Another insincere smile. I'm starting to think she's not a very good liar. You can tell she's lying whenever she smiles like that. Sure enough, she doesn't offer any other information. She just keeps that insincere smile plastered on her face.
Rintaro: Who are you?
Suzuha: Haaahh...
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha falls back down onto the counter with a deep sigh. She looks up at me from that position.
Suzuha: I was thinking of giving you a bunch of interesting information on the IBN 5100... But when you look at me like that, I don't feel like it anymore.
Rintaro: I'm not even interested in the IBN 5100.
UNSPOKEN: I'm more concerned with SERN right now. Solving one of Akiba's mysteries won't topple the Organization's regime, after all.
Rintaro: You don't have a shred of credibility. I have no way of knowing if that 'interesting information' of yours is true or not.
Suzuha: Wow, that's harsh! Well, I admit I am acting kinda suspicious. I won't tell you, but I'll give you a hint. And then you'll writhe in agony when you can't figure it out! Truth is, the IBN 5100 has a hidden function.
UNSPOKEN: A hidden function... That reminds me. I'm pretty sure the John Titor from 2000 said something like that. I search through my memories.
Rintaro: If I remember correctly, the IBN 5100 can do something or other with a proprietary programming language.
Suzuha: No way! How did you know!? Tell me, tell me!
UNSPOKEN: I only vaguely remembered, but it looks like I hit the mark. I grin.
Rintaro: It's another one of my powers -- Leading Question. I can read your heart of hearts.
Suzuha: What!? No fair!
UNSPOKEN: For some reason, Suzuha covers her face with both her hands. She opens her fingers just enough to peek at me. That's not enough to escape my power. 
Rintaro: I see everything, Amane Suzuha! Resistance is futile.
Suzuha: Kuh! Anyway, the IBN 5100 has a hidden function! It can decipher IBN's proprietary programming language, which was written before APL and BASIC became widespread. Isn't that surprising?
