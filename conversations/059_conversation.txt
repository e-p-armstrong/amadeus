Rintaro: Excellent. Good job.
UNSPOKEN: Though, to be accurate, it wasn't two nights in a row. I took an afternoon nap yesterday. Mayuri starts fishing through her convenience store bag. And then she takes out...
Mayuri: Tada! Canned oden!
UNSPOKEN: The canned oden is still warm when she gives it to me. I open the lid right away and eat the beef. Mayuri and I have been together for a long time, so she knows what I like. And when it comes to canned oden, beef is where it's at.
Mayuri: It's a present from Mayushii. They're 270 yen each, so savor it, okay?
Rintaro: I've been getting tired of eating bananas and chicken lately. Buy these instead from now on.
Mayuri: But Mayushii doesn't have enough pocket money to splurge like this all the time. And Mayushii loves bananas and chicken, so she'll keep buying them.
UNSPOKEN: Mmgh. I consider saying You'll get fat if you only eat frozen foods, but that threat's not very effective against Mayuri, so I hold my tongue. Her high metabolism prevents her from getting fat, no matter how much she eats.
Mayuri: But wait, there's more. Tadaâ™ª
UNSPOKEN: Next, she produces a small box with a RaiNet illustration.
Mayuri: RaiNet sausage! It comes with an Upa bottle cap as a bonus! I really wanted it, so I bought it.
UNSPOKEN: She sticks out her tongue with a shy giggle. Something tells me that in a few months' time, this lab will be neck-deep in Upa goods. There are only a few things right now, like the cushion on the sofa, but that number is sure to grow exponentially.
Mayuri: So how's Daru-kun?
Rintaro: He's in the midst of a hard fight. He should at least rest a little. I mean, I never said he had to do it all at once.
Mayuri: Daru-kun's super hacka spirit is on fire!
Itaru: Don't say hacka!
UNSPOKEN: An empty diet cola bottle comes whistling through the air. It hits my head with a nice thunk.
Mayuri: He sure is tense...
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri and I evacuate to a corner of the lounge and quietly eat the oden.
Mayuri: But, isn't hacking bad? Mayushii doesn't want you to do bad things...
Rintaro: I would be a fool to let Daru's super hacka... I mean, hacker skills go to waste.
UNSPOKEN: Incidentally, it looks like hackers hijacked SERN's system back in 2008. We found news articles about it online. That means even the inventors of the world wide web have holes in their security. With his skills, Daru should have no trouble getting through.
Rintaro: Besides, we're doing this to expose SERN's wrongdoings. This is a war against the dark forces that secretly rule the world!
Mayuri: Bad things are bad.
