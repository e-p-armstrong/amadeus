Suzuha: "Kuh! Anyway, the IBN 5100 has a hidden function! It can decipher IBN’s proprietary programming language, which was written before APL and BASIC became widespread. Isn’t that surprising?"
UNSPOKEN: Now I remember. John Titor said the same thing in 2000. And right after that, an IBN engineer officially admitted to that function’s existence.
Suzuha: "Now it’s a dead programming language that can only be deciphered with an IBN 5100."
UNSPOKEN: The reason Titor traveled to 1975 to obtain an IBN 5100 was because he needed that function. Maybe Moeka wants to use it too. Or maybe not. Shining Finger doesn’t seem like the type who’d know about that sort of function.
Suzuha: "That’s why IBN 5100s are so rare."
UNSPOKEN: While talking, Suzuha keeps dropping her glance to the metal pin in her hand. She rolls it around with her fingers. I guess that’s a habit of hers. So IBN 5100s are super rare? Maybe if I get one, I could sell it for a high price. That could be a good way to raise research funds. But first, I have to deal with SERN. Twenty hours have passed since Daru started hacking. Night gives way to a refreshing summer morning. I glance at Daru while browsing @channel on my phone. He’s fidgeting even more. Now his legs are like pistons. His knees move up and down in harmony with the rattatattat of his keyboard. Daru hasn’t slept in about 40 hours, but he still won’t get off the computer. I was going to ask him if he’d like a break, but his entire body is exuding an aura that says Don’t talk to me. I curl up a bit and return to my phone. My discussions with John Titor just aren’t making sense. Not even Titor himself seems to know about the Titor from ten years ago. It’s hard to imagine that everyone on @channel is conspiring against me. But how else can I explain it? Out of options, I decide to email Titor directly, just as he told me to. He audaciously exposed his own address on @channel. I guess that’s his way of saying Bring it on! In my email, I question the differences between his posts now and his posts ten years ago. The current Titor hasn’t even acknowledged the latter. I only vaguely remember them, but they basically went like this: - In 2015, World War III breaks out. Many people die. - By 2036, the world is a nuclear wasteland. - John Titor travels to 1975 to obtain an IBN 5100. The IBN 5100 was necessary to revive technology lost in World War III. - The IBN 5100 has a hidden function: the ability to read IBN’s proprietary computer language which predates APL and BASIC. - But only certain IBN engineers are aware of that function, so it does not appear in the manual. - In 1998, Titor meets his younger self and his parents in America. - John Titor was a soldier who volunteered for this mission. - John Titor is an American. Furthermore, in 2000, Titor correctly predicted the outcomes of some future events. The Peruvian coast earthquake in 2001, the election of a new pope, the outbreak of the Iraq War, China’s advances in space, and so forth. Though he only talked vaguely about each one, they all came true. On the other hand, other predictions went unfulfilled. For example, the Y2K bug, civil war in America, the cancellation of the Beijing Olympics, the inauguration of America’s first female president in 2009, and so forth. There’s more, but let’s leave those aside for now. I’m going to ask him why those predictions didn’t come true. Alright, let’s send it now. If he can’t answer to my satisfaction, then the current Titor is an impostor. This is your litmus test, John Titor. Heh heh heh. So, what are your true colors?
Mayuri: "Tutturu♪ Good morning!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri comes in. Looks like she’s forgiven us for experimenting on her food. She’s back to her usual smiley self.
Rintaro: "What are you doing here so early?"
