Rintaro: "Same."
Itaru: "Basically, if this is the server admin’s password, we can taste every inch of SERN’s luscious, luscious flesh. But if it’s just an ordinary researcher’s password, then we can only see SERN’s boobs."
Mayuri: "Daru-kun, that’s naughty!"
Rintaro: "Quit the erotic examples. Basically, you mean there’ll be limits to what information we can access."
Itaru: "Exactly. Anyway, it’s only a matter of time before I get a server admin’s password. Let’s save that for later. I’m really sleepy now."
UNSPOKEN: It would be cruel to push Daru any further. It’s unfortunate, but overworking him isn’t an option. Let’s let him rest so he can regain his energy.
Itaru: "Oh! Looks like our ID belongs to an accelerator division chief."
Rintaro: "So it’s not a server admin..."
Itaru: "It would take a miracle to get one on our first try. How many staff members do you think SERN has?"
Mayuri: "How many?"
Itaru: "Over 6000."
UNSPOKEN: That many?
Itaru: "Well, for now, let’s look at this accelerator division chief. Uh, his name is... Jack. Let’s look at his email log."
UNSPOKEN: And of course, the emails come up in English.
Mayuri: "Oh no... that makes Mayushii’s head hurt..."
UNSPOKEN: Hmph. It’s pathetic to flinch at the mere sight of English.
Rintaro: "Daru, what does that say?"
Itaru: "Need to translate it..."
Rintaro: "This is a job for Dr. Excite!"
Itaru: "Nah. I’ve got a better idea."
UNSPOKEN: Daru boots up translation software and auto-translates the open page. Poor, unnatural Japanese shows up. The first line says HAPPY NEW YEAR.
Itaru: "Looks like a new year’s greeting. Something about going on vacation in Spain... lucky bastard."
UNSPOKEN: That email’s normal. Nothing out of the ordinary.
Itaru: "If we keep scouring the log like this, we can also identify the server manager."
Mayuri: "You know, looking through someone else’s email without permission makes me feel really guilty..."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri gets depressed and moves away from the computer. She sits on the sofa and hugs her giant Upa cushion with a sigh. I know we’re doing something socially unacceptable. However...
Rintaro: "I abandoned guilt when I chose the path of Evil long ago! Muhahaha! Let the responsibility be mine. I will not ask you to answer for my crimes."
Itaru: "What a guy! I’d let Okarin do me in the butt."
Rintaro: "I decline your offer. Now get peeking, Daru!"
Mayuri: "Okarin, you’re bad... You make Mayushii sad."
UNSPOKEN: That’s of no concern to me. You just sit there and pretend your hands are clean. Upon further examination, we discover several emails with the title Experiment report. In English, naturally. Looks like he sends emails like these almost daily.
Rintaro: "LHC experiment reports? There could be a hint about time machines in there. We should try reading them."
Itaru: "This is definitely a crime, though..."
