Rintaro: Tch, of course it isn't that simple...
Itaru: Well, cracking this should be a piece of cake.
UNSPOKEN: Nice, super hacka. He's a genius, no doubt. Daru undoes the security in less than ten minutes. The real timesink is deciphering the crappy machine translation.
Itaru: Umm, translated into proper Japanese, it's... 'Hi, Pole!'
Rintaro: That acting's completely unnecessary.
Itaru: Aw... 'Uploaded today's data to the server. The LHC is performing admirably. Can't say the same about the rest, though.' 'This baby's fickle as a cat, but it was surprisingly obedient this month. It would be great if it stayed like this forever.' 'But don't you think this work is unrewarding? This kitten -- this 27-kilometer long kitten, HAHAHAHA -- has been in operation for nine years.' 'Our research will change the course of history, yet only a small group of people are allowed to see it.' 'Of course, if it were ever officially released, it would be one hell of a scandal.' 'People would probably say something like, 'Call Robert Zemeckiff to SERN right away. He could build it in less than a year.''
Rintaro: ...Nine years?
UNSPOKEN: Daru finishes reading. I rub my temples with my thumbs. Calm down. Let's sort things out.
Rintaro: Do you think there were any translation errors in that email?
UNSPOKEN: Did Daru notice something unnatural too? He's not joking like he usually does.
Itaru: If you trust the translation software, then that's what it says. The Japanese is strange in places, though.
Rintaro: But that doesn't make sense. I thought the LHC was only put into operation around spring last year. But this email makes it sound like it's been in operation for nine years.
Itaru: That is strange.
UNSPOKEN: The email's send date is this year, 2010. So nine years ago makes it 2001. John Titor posted this on @channel yesterday: The only other thing I can say is that you must not believe their lies. They have already succeeded at creating micro black holes. I gulp. If you read between the lines of this email... it sounds like they're doing some sort of secret experiment. Also, Robert Zemeckiff is a super-famous Hollywood movie director. He directed a trilogy of smash-hit time travel movies about twenty years ago. I groan. No way... was I right? SERN's hiding a major secret from the world? And it's related to time travel?
Rintaro: Keep looking, Daru. Search for anything related to time machine research.
Itaru: Seriously?
UNSPOKEN: I don't know if Daru is questioning my order or the possibility that SERN might be researching time travel. Either way, he begins tapping on the keyboard again.
Itaru: Hmm, there aren't any emails with the phrase 'time machine' in them... But the phrase 'Z Program' was used hundreds of times in the past few months. Do you think it could be about the current LHC experiments?
Rintaro: What is it specifically? Black hole formation experiments?
Itaru: Hmmm, let's try looking for a document... ah, found one.
