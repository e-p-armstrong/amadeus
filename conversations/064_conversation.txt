Suzuha: That's how people talk when they've been brainwashed, Nae.
Nae: Eh?
Rintaro: Nonsense, Part-Time Warrior. My brain has not been washed since the day I was born.
Nae: Are you a liar, Mister Okarin?
Rintaro: Don't call me that!
Nae: ...!
Suzuha: You shouldn't yell at children. Look, she's shaking.
UNSPOKEN: But 'Mister' makes me sound old. I'm not even old enough to drink yet... what a disgrace. No, there's no point getting angry at a child. I need to show composure as an adult.

Itaru: I'm not a perv! I'm a pervy gentleman!
Kurisu: What does that even mean!?
