Rintaro: "You can’t look it up with the ID you have?"
UNSPOKEN: Daru shakes his head.
Rintaro: "Well, I guess let’s call it a day."
Itaru: "By the way, what we just saw was SERN’s biggest server, but I also found a strange database on the network."
Rintaro: "Strange how?"
Itaru: "It was buggy."
Rintaro: "Buggy?"
Itaru: "I mean, it was full of some kind of code... But the code was gibberish. Utterly impossible to decode, thank you very much."
Rintaro: "Could it be encrypted?"
Itaru: "Not by any algorithm I’ve ever seen. It wouldn’t even work as a program. It just bothers me. Why would they have a database that nobody could ever use?"
Rintaro: "That is strange."
Itaru: "I’ll see what I can find out."
UNSPOKEN: Daru tries every trick in the book to crack that mystery database. But after about an hour, the pistons he has for fingers begin speeding up. Eventually, he just slams the keyboard out of frustration.
Itaru: "Agh! I don’t get it! I don’t get it at all! You call this a program, dumbass!? Go to hell!"
UNSPOKEN: Oh great, he snapped...
Mayuri: "I think you should stop..."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri puts down her sewing tools and turns to Daru with a worried look on her face.
Itaru: "My head is spinning... I can’t take it any more... fweh, fweheh..."
UNSPOKEN: This is bad. Daru’s breaking down. Maybe I’m pushing him too far. He’s been up two days straight. He’s probably at his limit.
Rintaro: "Good work. Go rest, Daru."
Itaru: "Yeah... I’ll do that. Anyway, even if it isn’t a bug, but an actual program, only the guys who made it could understand it. I’ve never seen anything like it..."
UNSPOKEN: A program unlike anything he’s seen... hmm. At that moment, music bursts from my pocket. I’ve got mail.
Rintaro: "...!"
UNSPOKEN: It’s from John Titor. Did he reply to the email I sent him earlier? I gulp. A flash runs through my head like an electric shock. There’s quite a bit of text, but what catches my eye are the first several lines.
Rintaro: "Heh heh heh... of course. Everything is falling into place."
Mayuri: "Whatcha talking about?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri looks at me curiously, but I don’t have time to answer her. I’m frantically assembling the pieces in my mind.
Rintaro: "John Titor... SERN... the time machine..."
UNSPOKEN: These things are all connected. And now, I have another piece of the puzzle. I shiver at my own brilliance.
Rintaro: "Daru, I think I know how we can read that program."
Itaru: "Seriously? How?"
UNSPOKEN: I aim my phone’s camera at the screen displaying the supposedly bugged data and take a picture. I attach it to a message -- Does this code look familiar? -- and send it to Titor. A mysterious database inside SERN. A program unlike anything Super Hacka Daru has ever seen. Its true form is...
Rintaro: "If my hunch is correct, John Titor should know!"
Itaru: "What? There’s no way!"
