UNSPOKEN: Kurisu says without lifting her eyes from her book. Maybe I should tell her about how that D-Mail changed the past. And about how she seems to have lost her memories about it. Why am I considering talking to Kurisu? Because I don't think Mayuri or Daru would understand this problem. Kurisu, on the other hand, might be able to form a hypothesis. That's what I hope. Just then, my phone rings. Is it Titor? Titor's calling me!? Startled, I look at my phone's display. It's Daru. I click my tongue in disappointment. Don't scare me like that.
Rintaro: Christina. There's something I want to talk to you about.
Kurisu: Shouldn't you answer your phone first?
Rintaro: It's Daru. It's probably something stupid.
UNSPOKEN: Before he left, Daru said he was going to MayQueen. He had a silly grin on his face. There's no way he'd suddenly call me for something serious.
Kurisu: You're really self-righteous, you know.
Rintaro: You might not remember this, but earlier, I changed the past with a D-Mail.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu stares at me. Her expression is more stern than usual.
Kurisu: ...I haven't known you long enough to tell whether you're serious.
Rintaro: It happened. And then everyone except me forgot about it. Or rather, the fact that it happened was erased from history.
Kurisu: The past changed, so the present changed with it? The Butterfly Effect, huh. But what you're saying is nonsense.
Rintaro: Why do you say that?
Kurisu: Why do you remember that the past changed? If you used a time machine to physically travel to the past and change history, then that might explain it -- barely. But with a D-Mail, you haven't taken one step outside the present, have you?' So if the present changed, and we changed with it, you would have to change too. Or are you saying you didn't change because you're the observer? In that case, you're claiming that you're not a human being.
UNSPOKEN: I understand what Kurisu's saying, and I don't have the means to convince her otherwise. And that's exactly why I'm trying to get in touch with Titor.
Rintaro: ...Everything is the choice of Steins Gate! This is the power of my magic eye, Reading Steiner! Muhahaha!
Kurisu: Aaaand he's at it again.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu sighs and goes back to her book.
Kurisu: I'm not playing along with your games. I bet you came up with that Reading Whatever thing just now, didn't you?
