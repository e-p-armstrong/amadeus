Rintaro: Just what does this crumbly old Braun Tube Workshop need to get 'ready'?
Suzuha: Nothing, really. Geez. I just mindlessly sweep in front of the shop. If I clean inside, the boss gets angry. 'Everything's where it needs to be,' he says.
UNSPOKEN: So he's paying her to not clean? Something's wrong with that guy.
Rintaro: So hear me out, then.
Suzuha: But I'm so tired.
UNSPOKEN: In other words, she doesn't feel like talking. I glare at her.
Rintaro: You would be... unwise to anger me.
Suzuha: Does it have to be right now?
UNSPOKEN: My glare is not very effective. She doesn't falter at all. But I still maintain my stern expression and nod.
Suzuha: Then go ahead.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha shrugs her shoulders as she locks her bicycle. Then she turns to me.
Suzuha: But keep it short, okay?
Rintaro: Where is the IBN 5100?
Suzuha: No intel yet.
Rintaro: What?
Suzuha: I don't know.
UNSPOKEN: Oh.
Rintaro: But by the way you talked yesterday, it sure sounded like you knew.
Suzuha: No, I know someone who knows.
Rintaro: Then take me to them. I won't take no for an answer. Refuse, and I'll show you a living hell.
Suzuha: I can't.
UNSPOKEN: Come on! I even said I'd show you a living hell!
Suzuha: I can't introduce you even if I wanted to.
Rintaro: What do you mean? Don't tell me they're an imaginary--
Suzuha: They've been dead for years.
Rintaro: I'm sorry.
Suzuha: Nah, it's okay. Anyway, there's nothing I can tell you. Honestly, I'm hoping you can tell me something.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha pats me on the shoulders. Funny. You'd think I'm the one who's supposed to cheer her up. Just then, Mr. Braun opens the door and makes his appearance.
Tennouji: Hey, part-timer! It's only your third day and you're late!?
Suzuha: Sorry, boss! The streets were a little crowded this morning.
Tennouji: If you're not gonna take this seriously, I can always give you the boot, hear? As for you, Okabe, don't you lay a finger on my part-timer.
Rintaro: Aren't you the lecherous one here, Mister Braun?
Tennouji: Why you. Just try saying something like that in front of Nae. I'll murder ya. Gotta keep my honor as a father. Besides, I ain't got no use for a skinny kid like her.
Suzuha: What was that!? Take that back, boss!
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha's actually mad now.
Tennouji: What, you mad?
Suzuha: I'm not a kid! I'm a warrior!
Tennouji: Hah? What're you talking about?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha's burning passion has the manager shocked. I, on the other hand, am impressed. On impulse, I take Suzuha's hand and grasp it firmly.
Rintaro: I like the look in your eyes, you Part-Time Warrior. They shine with the radiance of the beast unseen in modern men. Never forget those eyes of yours, and you shall surely change class from Part-Time Warrior... to True Warrior.
