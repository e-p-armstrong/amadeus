UNSPOKEN: Crap, I guess I am being too loud. That kind of ruins the whole secret feeling. And the window’s open, too. If Suzuha is down below, I’m sure she can hear everything. So I turn it down a notch.
Rintaro: "Understand? The world has no need for two mad scientists. Before they can get ahead of us, we must outwit them!"
Itaru: "Who are they?"
Rintaro: "You know... them."
Mayuri: "Um, Mayushii doesn’t get it at all..."
Rintaro: "Basically, we must obtain the phantom retro PC... the IBN 5100, said to be located somewhere in Akiba."
UNSPOKEN: I make a magnificent declaration, but Daru just rubs his eyes, and Mayuri returns to her needlework. Dammit, is there anything you guys react to!? We’ve uncovered a massive conspiracy here! How come you aren’t excited!?
Itaru: "I’ll pass on the search. I’m seriously tired. Besides, I want to keep combing SERN’s server."
Rintaro: "That’s true... Well, you’re the only one who can do that, Daru, so I’ll leave it to you. So, the IBN 5100 investigation squad shall consist of Mayuri and me--"
Mayuri: "I can’t..."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri makes an apologetic face.
Mayuri: "I have to make costumes, and I have work, too."
UNSPOKEN: So basically, you two are telling me this: I’m the only one with free time.
Rintaro: "Fine. I’ll manage alone somehow. It’s useless to try and stop me. Understood?"
Mayuri: "Are you going to do something bad again?"
Itaru: "Nah, he’s all talk."
UNSPOKEN: I leave my useless comrades behind and stride gallantly out of the lab. I step out onto the street. Immediately, a bicycle skids to a stop in front of me.
Suzuha: "Hiya, Okabe Rintaro."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha gets off her bicycle and gives me a strange greeting. I want to ask her, Are you an American or something? but I’m distracted by her shiny bicycle. It’s the same bicycle that was in front of the Braun Tube Workshop yesterday. I guess it belongs to her. I wonder how much that set her back. I mean, it does look pretty expensive.
Rintaro: "Pretty nice technique there."
Suzuha: "Bicycles are fun, aren’t they? I’d never ridden one before coming here."
Rintaro: "You’d never ridden a bicycle!?"
Suzuha: "Nope. I had ridden motorcycles before, though."
UNSPOKEN: Isn’t that backwards? Weird girl. And what’s with that flashy braking back there? I think it’d be pretty dangerous if she did that all through the town. Beginners get cocky and get into accidents. You see that pattern all the time. If you’re going to go full speed, at least wear a helmet.
Rintaro: "Going to work now?"
Suzuha: "Yup."
