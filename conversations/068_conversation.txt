Rintaro: Stay diligent in your training, and you shall have a place at my side on the field of Ragnarok.
Suzuha: Ragnarok?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha looks confused.
Suzuha: What's that?
Rintaro: The final battle against SERN.
Suzuha: You've got something like that planned? Count me in if you do, but I've never heard of it.
Rintaro: Of course you haven't. This is the first time I've revealed it. For I shall be the one to initiate Ragnarok! And the world shall be reborn!
Suzuha: Wow! You sure are brave, Okabe Rintaro. You'll probably fail, but I like your spirit. I wish my comrades were as spirited as you are.
UNSPOKEN: Apparently, Suzuha has comrades. I'd like her to introduce me. That way, I can form my personal army, the Phoenix Crusaders. ...Wait a sec. Why does she assume I'll fail at Ragnarok? Looks like I need to instill the fear of Hououin Kyouma into this girl.

Suzuha: Coming! Later, Okabe Rintaro!

Mayuri: Wait up, Okarin!
UNSPOKEN: Then Mayuri comes down the stairs, passing Suzuha.

Mayuri: Oh, no, that's not it. I was thinking about buying lunch.
UNSPOKEN: She really is a glutton. It's not even lunchtime yet.
Rintaro: So, where do you plan to go?
Mayuri: Hmmm, what to eat...
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri places her finger on her bottom lip in thought as she walks.
Mayuri: Sanbo's beef bowl sounds good!
UNSPOKEN: This tiny high school girl truly has guts to enter Sanbo alone. That place isn't like the chain restaurants with their colorful menus and brightly-lit interiors. First timers are often cowed by the old-school atmosphere. Plus, the clientele is almost exclusively male. But Mayuri doesn't care. She just sits there, shoulder to shoulder with students and salarymen, smiling as she eats her beef bowl. Meanwhile, the Sanbists -- regular Sanbo customers -- are posting comments online like The Goddess has arrived! or Goddess for the win!
Rintaro: But Sanbo isn't open this earl--
