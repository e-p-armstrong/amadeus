UNSPOKEN: When I asked her about it one day, she just smiled and gave that answer. At first she only reached out to the night sky, but lately, she's been doing it without regard to the time of day. Like now. Even when she's walking and talking with someone, something inside her just seems to switch on. Honestly, it's a little crazy.
Rintaro: It's too early for stars, Mayuri.
UNSPOKEN: I walk up to Mayuri and call out to her. She slowly lowers her hand with a blank smile on her face.
Mayuri: Did you know? Even during the day, the stars are still up there.
Rintaro: Getting philosophical is nice and all, but it's dangerous to stop in the middle of the street.
Mayuri: Ehehe! That's true. Oh, just now, when I was looking at the stars, I decided to have ramen for lunch today!
