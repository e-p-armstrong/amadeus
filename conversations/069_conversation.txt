Rintaro: Who's writing that report?
Kurisu: You, of course. This is your operation. And if we could get a report from the subject too, that would be even better.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu glances at Daru.
Rintaro: ...Are you not interested in changing the past? What happened to your eagerness to experiment?
Kurisu: Did you forget what I said this afternoon? I'm against it.
Rintaro: But you were so enthusiastic when we began the experiments. You went along without a single complaint.
Kurisu: In your dreams, maybe.
UNSPOKEN: I twist my lips into a grin.
Rintaro: You're not being objective, Christi... Celeb Sev.
Kurisu: If you're going to correct yourself, at least get it right.
