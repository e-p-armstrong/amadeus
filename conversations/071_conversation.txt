Rintaro: "Well, if it isn’t my assistant. What are you doing here?"
Kurisu: "Hey. When did I become your assistant?"
UNSPOKEN: She looks like she’ll snap at me, so to dampen her spirit, I go back to checking my email. What is wrong with this woman!? I told her to tell me her phone number and she just ignored me! And she doesn’t even have any information! How useless can you be!?
Kurisu: "...Why are you glaring at me?"
Rintaro: "Don’t worry about it. You’re not the cause of my frustration."
Kurisu: "Oh, so you’re just raging? Don’t glare at me."
Rintaro: "You’ve glared at me before, haven’t you?"
Kurisu: "That’s because you keep doing pervy-- Ah, no, I’m not saying anything."
UNSPOKEN: Another one? I want to snap my phone in half and throw it on the ground. What do you mean Tell me the super hacka’s address♪!? You making fun of me with that ♪? You’re not getting anything from me! Anyway, why does she need to send me two short consecutive emails? I mean, she might as well just combine them into one.
Kurisu: "Are the emails you’re getting really that unpleasant?"
Rintaro: "They’re more... unreasonable than unpleasant."
UNSPOKEN: I can’t quite describe it in one word. Stop sending me all these short emails! I’m begging you, just gather your thoughts and send everything together! I feel a little satisfied after sending that email. I turn to Kurisu again.
Rintaro: "So, Christina, what brings you here?"
Kurisu: "If you’re going to call me names, could you at least be consistent? Anyway, my business here doesn’t concern you."
Rintaro: "Why are you pouting?"
Kurisu: "I’m not pouting. I just don’t want to get involved in your silly games again."
Rintaro: "Nonsense. You’re already a lab mem. You have a duty to work for the benefit of the lab!"
UNSPOKEN: Well, she is only a temporary member. No, it’s because she’s a temporary member that we need to get as much out of her as we can.
Kurisu: "...I regret losing myself to curiosity back then."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu sighs and looks up at the satellite. We’re not alone. Several other people are standing here and looking up. It’s Akiba’s latest tourist attraction.
Rintaro: "Did you come to see the satellite?"
Kurisu: "...I guess. It doesn’t make sense. Normally, they calculate satellites’ orbits so that they burn up in the atmosphere when they fall. So how can that thing be in such perfect condition?"
UNSPOKEN: And that’s to say nothing about the huge hole it punched in the building. Are satellites that durable?
Rintaro: "Where’s this satellite from, anyway?"
Kurisu: "They still don’t know. Rumors say it’s from the former Soviet Union, but Russia denies it. So it looks like they can’t remove it yet."
UNSPOKEN: Three days have passed and it’s still unknown. How interesting. I smell a conspiracy.
Rintaro: "So it’s another Organization cover-up! They knew I’d be at Radi-Kan and tried to erase me!"
