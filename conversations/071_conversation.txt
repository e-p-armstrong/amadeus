UNSPOKEN: Kurisu hangs her head and blushes for some reason.
Rintaro: What's wrong?
Kurisu: N-nothing! Really, nothing, okay? Say another word and I hit you!
UNSPOKEN: Crazy girl.
Kurisu: A-anyway! What's happened with the PhoneWave!?
Rintaro: I thought you didn't want to get involved. And it's not the PhoneWave, it's the PhoneWave (name subject to change)--
Kurisu: Just answer me. Have you learned anything?
Rintaro: No progress. We've tried repeating the experiment, but at present, we haven't been able to reproduce the discharge phenomenon or send another email to the past.
Kurisu: I see...
UNSPOKEN: Another email. Damn you, Shining Finger. I said not to send so many short emails, but she doesn't seem to get it! I can't handle this mail demon. Looks like she's rethinking things. Hopefully I don't have to worry about any more email assaults.
Kurisu: Hello? Can you put your phone away when you're talking with someone?
Rintaro: Don't be like that. Rather, you should praise me, for I have taught a foul mail demon to behave like a civilized human being.
Kurisu: Why are you so pompous?
Rintaro: I'd ask you the same thing, Christina.
UNSPOKEN: Okay, let's send a reply. Apology accepted. I'm looking for an IBN 5100 too. I agree that we should exchange information. I'll let you know when I have something. You don't need to reply to this mail. I type that out and send it.
Kurisu: Are you done with your little mail exchange? Hououin-san?
Rintaro: Oh? So you remember my true name. Indeed, I am Hououin Kyouma.
Kurisu: I was being facetious.
Rintaro: How was that facetious? You called me by my correct name. You made no mistake. You'll make a good assistant.
Kurisu: Okabe-san... have you sought professional help?
Rintaro: I am not Okabe!
Kurisu: This is exhausting...
UNSPOKEN: Let's save checking the email for later.
Kurisu: You're pompous, but at least you have some manners.
Rintaro: What do you mean?
Kurisu: I hate people who play with their phones in the middle of a conversation.
Rintaro: Ah, so that's why you grabbed my phone when we first met.
Kurisu: When we first met? I didn't do that.
Rintaro: Yeah you did. There I was, giving my report, when you grabbed my--
UNSPOKEN: ...phone out of my hand. I shut my mouth before I finish. The events at Radi-Kan. My story of what happened back then doesn't mesh with Daru's story. It didn't mesh with Mayuri's. And now it won't mesh Kurisu's. So in the end, was that a dream? A hallucination?
Kurisu: What? What do you mean 'giving your report'?
Rintaro: No. It's nothing. So, about the PhoneWave (name subject to change). After the experiment, you screamed something like 'A time machine? It can't be!' Did something awaken a past trauma?
Kurisu: No. And don't go making one up either.
Rintaro: Back when she was five years old, Christina was on the plains of Arkansas when lightning--
