Rintaro: "The Organization is the Organization. Its formal name is something else, but all those who know of its existence call it the Organization out of fear. They rule the world from the shadows, transcending nations, with politics, economics, religion, even science in their clutches."
Kurisu: "That’s obviously a crackpot conspiracy theory, thank you very mu--"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu hangs her head and blushes for some reason.
Rintaro: "What’s wrong?"
Kurisu: "N-nothing! Really, nothing, okay? Say another word and I hit you!"
UNSPOKEN: Crazy girl.
Kurisu: "A-anyway! What’s happened with the PhoneWave!?"
Rintaro: "I thought you didn’t want to get involved. And it’s not the PhoneWave, it’s the PhoneWave (name subject to change)--"
Kurisu: "Just answer me. Have you learned anything?"
Rintaro: "No progress. We’ve tried repeating the experiment, but at present, we haven’t been able to reproduce the discharge phenomenon or send another email to the past."
Kurisu: "I see..."
UNSPOKEN: Another email. Damn you, Shining Finger. I said not to send so many short emails, but she doesn’t seem to get it! I can’t handle this mail demon. Looks like she’s rethinking things. Hopefully I don’t have to worry about any more email assaults.
Kurisu: "Hello? Can you put your phone away when you’re talking with someone?"
Rintaro: "Don’t be like that. Rather, you should praise me, for I have taught a foul mail demon to behave like a civilized human being."
Kurisu: "Why are you so pompous?"
Rintaro: "I’d ask you the same thing, Christina."
UNSPOKEN: Okay, let’s send a reply. Apology accepted. I’m looking for an IBN 5100 too. I agree that we should exchange information. I’ll let you know when I have something. You don’t need to reply to this mail. I type that out and send it.
Kurisu: "Are you done with your little mail exchange? Hououin-san?"
Rintaro: "Oh? So you remember my true name. Indeed, I am Hououin Kyouma."
Kurisu: "I was being facetious."
Rintaro: "How was that facetious? You called me by my correct name. You made no mistake. You’ll make a good assistant."
Kurisu: "Okabe-san... have you sought professional help?"
Rintaro: "I am not Okabe!"
Kurisu: "This is exhausting..."
UNSPOKEN: Let’s save checking the email for later.
Kurisu: "You’re pompous, but at least you have some manners."
Rintaro: "What do you mean?"
Kurisu: "I hate people who play with their phones in the middle of a conversation."
Rintaro: "Ah, so that’s why you grabbed my phone when we first met."
Kurisu: "When we first met? I didn’t do that."
Rintaro: "Yeah you did. There I was, giving my report, when you grabbed my--"
