Kurisu: You make a fine argument, but it won't work in the scientific community. The day you decide to research time travel is the day you're out of a job.
Rintaro: How can you be so certain?
Kurisu: Because that's what happened to my father.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu grimaces.
Kurisu: My father, a physicist, loved time machines. He was so fascinated by Wells's 'The Time Machine' that he seriously studied time travel. But because of his obsession, he was practically exiled from the scientific community. I will never get involved with time travel research!
UNSPOKEN: This time, her sheer force of will gives me pause. Umm... I think she's really pissed. I may have stepped on a landmine here. What do I do? If I get her any angrier, she might seriously hit me. Let's calm her down a little. Yeah, let's do that. But what should I say?
Kurisu: ...I'm sorry. I got emotional.
UNSPOKEN: She apologizes first. Christina's calm character saves me.
Rintaro: Muhahaha! Don't worry about it! I wanted to test your character, so I made you angry on purpose!
Kurisu: ...Huh? ...Anyway, the PhoneWave isn't a time machine. Email is a manmade system, so this phenomenon should be explainable in the scope of that system.
Rintaro: I understand. I had no idea you hate time machines that much. It's almost like an allergy. I apologize for forcing you to become a lab mem. You don't have to come again.
Kurisu: ...I wasn't planning on it.
Rintaro: But know this, Christina.
Kurisu: Don't call me Christina.
Rintaro: Lab Mem Number 004 will be a retired number. That number... is yours forever.
UNSPOKEN: I finish my speech and turn my back to Kurisu. I won't look back. I walk away slowly with my eyes closed. It's kind of hard to walk like this. Hope I don't bump into anyone. Wait, am I even walking straight?
Kurisu: You look ridiculous!
UNSPOKEN: My shoulder is suddenly pulled from behind. I brace myself so I don't fall backwards.
Rintaro: What are you doing!? You've ruined my perfectly-staged exit scene! And you call yourself my assistant!?
Kurisu: No, I don't call myself your assistant! And besides, I still have something to ask you!
UNSPOKEN: Dammit, her stubbornness has already returned!
Kurisu: I asked you about this before, but you said I got stabbed, right? I demand an explanation.
UNSPOKEN: Ah yes, the other real-life phenomenon that has yet to be explained.
Rintaro: That was just something I hallucinated.
UNSPOKEN: Let's just leave it at that for now.
Kurisu: Why would you dream about me?
Rintaro: I don't know. And it wasn't a dream. It was a hallucination.
Kurisu: You said something about Doctor Nakabachi, didn't you?
Rintaro: Doctor Nakabachi held a time machine presentation at Radi-Kan that day.
Kurisu: That presentation was canceled because of the satellite crash.
Rintaro: So it seems. But in my hallucination, the presentation proceeded as planned. Mayuri and I went to see it, and you came over to flirt with me.
Kurisu: I don't flirt. Especially not with idiots like you.
