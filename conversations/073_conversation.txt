Rintaro: "No. It’s nothing. So, about the PhoneWave (name subject to change). After the experiment, you screamed something like ’A time machine? It can’t be!’ Did something awaken a past trauma?"
Kurisu: "No. And don’t go making one up either."
Rintaro: "Back when she was five years old, Christina was on the plains of Arkansas when lightning--"
Kurisu: "I wasn’t hit by lightning! And I was still living in Japan when I was five! And why Arkansas?"
Rintaro: "I was trying to imagine tranquil scenery, and the first state to come to mind was Arkansas. Second was Oregon."
Kurisu: "Not Utah? I mean, relatively speaking, isn’t Utah more suitable?"
Rintaro: "Then answer me, Christina! Why did you freak out back then!?"
Kurisu: "...No reason. I simply didn’t want to believe. Fringe science should stay in the realm of fiction."
Rintaro: "Fringe science? Don’t be ridiculous. You saw it with your own eyes. You saw the email leap to the past! You saw the banana travel instantly through space!"
Kurisu: "I saw... but we must be missing something. Or maybe we’re just seeing what we want to see. Remember what I said at ATF? Time machines are just a pipe dream given modern technology. And yet a bunch of amateurs like you just stick a phone and a microwave together and expect time travel to occur? Ridiculous."
Rintaro: "But it did occur! Will you deny what you saw with your own eyes? Are you saying that theories trump reality? Then I hope you enjoy sophistry and word games, because that’s all you’ll ever have!"
Kurisu: "What do you mean, word games?"
Rintaro: "Quantum theory, for example. If you ask me, theories like that are nothing but word games!"
Kurisu: "Wait, are you rejecting modern physics? Who do you think you are?"
Rintaro: "Trust what you see! The only things that matter are things that happen; things that don’t happen, things that aren’t observed, are just hypotheses!"
Kurisu: "When hypotheses pile up, and theories are verified, they become reality. That’s how modern physics comes to understand the truth of the universe."
Rintaro: "But sometimes your hypotheses are mistaken! Even Einstein was wrong about some things!"
Kurisu: "So you’re going to do nothing, just because you could be wrong? Then enjoy your dirty little lab and your silly gadgets, because that’s all you’ll ever have. You’ll never reach the truth that way. Failure teaches success."
Rintaro: "I see. Nice rebuttal."
Kurisu: "...You’re never getting off your high horse, are you?"
Rintaro: "By the way, Christina, I have always felt that physicists are hypocrites."
Kurisu: "...What?"
Rintaro: "There are phenomena that everyone knows occur in reality, but which physicists refuse to research. What do you think about that?"
Kurisu: "I don’t know what to say unless you can give me some examples."
Rintaro: "Ghosts, for instance."
Kurisu: "The occult? Really?"
Rintaro: "You refuse to research it just because it’s the occult? That contradicts what you just said! ’You’ll never reach the truth that way!’ People have seen ghosts. There is even photographic evidence. So where are the theories? Why do physicists refuse to speak?"
