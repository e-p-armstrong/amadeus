Kurisu: Escapism? That's unexpectedly chicken of you.
Rintaro: It's a hypothesis. Your favorite thing.
Kurisu: So who stabbed me? Don't tell me it was you.
UNSPOKEN: I recall the sight of Kurisu collapsed in a puddle of blood. It sends shivers down my spine. Was that really just a hallucination? It was too real. I can clearly remember the smell of blood.
Rintaro: You were already dead when I got there. I didn't see who did it.
Kurisu: I don't get it. Why do I have to die in your mind? You have something against me?
Rintaro: Of course not. At that point in time, we had only spoken once. We were just strangers.
UNSPOKEN: Well, that one time we talked was during the events I imagined. So strictly speaking, at that point in time, all I knew about her was what I'd read in the magazine.
Rintaro: Anyway, we didn't know each other. That's why I ran away instead of calling for an ambulance.
Kurisu: My hero.
Rintaro: What? You want me to go back in time and give you CPR or something? I'd need to use the PhoneWave (name subject to change) for that.
Kurisu: ...I've heard enough. No more hallucinating about me, okay? Dying isn't fun, even if it's in someone else's head.
Rintaro: I can't make any guarantees. That would require perfect 24-hour surveillance inside my brain.
Kurisu: You have a comeback for everything, don't you.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu shakes her head in exasperation, then turns and walks off towards the station. Looks like she wants to end the conversation. In revenge for last time, I grab Kurisu's slender shoulder from behind.
Kurisu: Kyah! What now!?
Rintaro: I'm not done talking!
Kurisu: You trying to pick a fight?
Rintaro: It's revenge for ruining my farewell scene, Christina! You shall regret your thoughtless actions!
Kurisu: Okay, okay, fine. What is it?
Rintaro: About the IBN 5100.
Kurisu: I don't know what you're talking about.
Rintaro: ...If you don't know, then forget about it. Farewell! We will not meet again.
UNSPOKEN: I turn my back to Kurisu. This time, I'll make a perfect--
Kurisu: Hey! Don't tell me to forget about it!
UNSPOKEN: She grabs my arm. Dammit! This is the second time!
Kurisu: What is the IBN five... whatever?
Rintaro: Then IBN 5100. It's a retro PC from 1975. I'm looking for one.
Kurisu: Yeah? What are you going to do with it?
UNSPOKEN: Looks like she's interested. She was the same way when she came to the lab. I guess this girl is just brimming with curiosity.
Rintaro: Interested?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu quickly averts her eyes. But she doesn't let go of my arm.
Rintaro: You're interested, aren't you?
Kurisu: ...Just a little.
Rintaro: Then I shall answer! The IBN 5100 is the key to unlocking SERN's most closely guarded secrets.
Kurisu: SERN? You mean... the SERN?
Rintaro: Indeed. Through the tireless efforts of my faithful lab mems, we have uncovered evidence that SERN is researching time travel.
