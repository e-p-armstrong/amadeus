Kurisu: "Why would you dream about me?"
Rintaro: "I don’t know. And it wasn’t a dream. It was a hallucination."
Kurisu: "You said something about Doctor Nakabachi, didn’t you?"
Rintaro: "Doctor Nakabachi held a time machine presentation at Radi-Kan that day."
Kurisu: "That presentation was canceled because of the satellite crash."
Rintaro: "So it seems. But in my hallucination, the presentation proceeded as planned. Mayuri and I went to see it, and you came over to flirt with me."
Kurisu: "I don’t flirt. Especially not with idiots like you."
Rintaro: "Like I said, it wasn’t real, okay? No... maybe this world is what isn’t real. That would explain the riddle of the PhoneWave (name subject to change). If this world is some kind of simulation, then we can disregard the laws of physics."
Kurisu: "Escapism? That’s unexpectedly chicken of you."
Rintaro: "It’s a hypothesis. Your favorite thing."
Kurisu: "So who stabbed me? Don’t tell me it was you."
UNSPOKEN: I recall the sight of Kurisu collapsed in a puddle of blood. It sends shivers down my spine. Was that really just a hallucination? It was too real. I can clearly remember the smell of blood.
Rintaro: "You were already dead when I got there. I didn’t see who did it."
Kurisu: "I don’t get it. Why do I have to die in your mind? You have something against me?"
Rintaro: "Of course not. At that point in time, we had only spoken once. We were just strangers."
UNSPOKEN: Well, that one time we talked was during the events I imagined. So strictly speaking, at that point in time, all I knew about her was what I’d read in the magazine.
Rintaro: "Anyway, we didn’t know each other. That’s why I ran away instead of calling for an ambulance."
Kurisu: "My hero."
Rintaro: "What? You want me to go back in time and give you CPR or something? I’d need to use the PhoneWave (name subject to change) for that."
Kurisu: "...I’ve heard enough. No more hallucinating about me, okay? Dying isn’t fun, even if it’s in someone else’s head."
Rintaro: "I can’t make any guarantees. That would require perfect 24-hour surveillance inside my brain."
Kurisu: "You have a comeback for everything, don’t you."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu shakes her head in exasperation, then turns and walks off towards the station. Looks like she wants to end the conversation. In revenge for last time, I grab Kurisu’s slender shoulder from behind.
Kurisu: "Kyah! What now!?"
Rintaro: "I’m not done talking!"
Kurisu: "You trying to pick a fight?"
Rintaro: "It’s revenge for ruining my farewell scene, Christina! You shall regret your thoughtless actions!"
Kurisu: "Okay, okay, fine. What is it?"
Rintaro: "About the IBN 5100."
Kurisu: "I don’t know what you’re talking about."
Rintaro: "...If you don’t know, then forget about it. Farewell! We will not meet again."
