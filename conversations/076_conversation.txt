UNSPOKEN: Mayuri trots up to me in full maid regalia. She has a convenience store bag in hand.
Mayuri: Mayushii went to the convenience store during lunch break.
UNSPOKEN: Then Mayuri takes out her pocket watch, Pockety. She checks the time.
Mayuri: Now there's only five minutes left!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri squats next to the stairs.
Rintaro: Good work. So, what was that amazing thing you heard?
Mayuri: Before that, food.
UNSPOKEN: She takes some fried chicken out of the convenience store bag as she speaks. The aroma of the chicken stirs my appetite.
Rintaro: Let me have one.
Mayuri: Okay.
UNSPOKEN: She skewers a piece of chicken on a toothpick and holds it out for me.
Mayuri: Here you goâ™ª
Rintaro: You can't do that in front of the store. You're supposed to be a maid.
Mayuri: So?
Rintaro: Here, you're not Shiina Mayuri, but Mayushii NyanNyan. You can't 'say aah' in front of the store! Your customers are going to see that as an act of betrayal.
Mayuri: Oh! Mayushii didn't think of that.
UNSPOKEN: With that said, I take the chicken off the toothpick by hand and throw it into my mouth. Mmm, delicious. Not as good as Juicy Chicken Number One, though.
Rintaro: Well? What was that amazing thing you heard?
Mayuri: Oh, right! Actually, it's about the IBN 5100.
Rintaro: You found a lead!? Of course, it was at MayQueen! I can't believe I missed it!
Mayuri: No it's not! That's silly!
UNSPOKEN: Damn! Don't get my hopes up like that. Mayuri has a triumphant look on her face, but I don't see where this is going at all.
Mayuri: Mayushii was thinking of the IBN 5100 during work, so I asked the other girls if they knew anything. First I asked Makki-chan, but Makki-chan said she's not good with computers. And then there's LisaLisa-chan, but she only knows about the latest PCs. And she's actually a Machead...
Rintaro: Just get to the point. I don't really care how much trouble you went through.
Mayuri: Hm? Um, well, I think Feris-chan knows.
Rintaro: What!? Is that true!?
Mayuri: Yup. Did you know she's a retro PC maniac?
Rintaro: Faris?
UNSPOKEN: That girl is seriously hardcore. I'd prefer to stay away from her if possible. But I'm really desperate for information. I take out my phone and put it to my ear.
Rintaro: It's me. Looks like we've got a lead on the IBN 5100. Are you ready for this? It's Faris NyanNyan. It turns out that catgirl's an expert on retro PCs. There's probably another side to this. Let's keep our eyes peeled. ...Hmph. I suppose I'm the only man for the job. Very well. I'll make the approach. If you don't hear from me by 2000 hours tonight, then forget about me and commence the strike on MayQueen. Everything is the choice of Steins Gate... El Psy Kongroo.
