Kurisu: "Hey! Don’t tell me to forget about it!"
UNSPOKEN: She grabs my arm. Dammit! This is the second time!
Kurisu: "What is the IBN five... whatever?"
Rintaro: "Then IBN 5100. It’s a retro PC from 1975. I’m looking for one."
Kurisu: "Yeah? What are you going to do with it?"
UNSPOKEN: Looks like she’s interested. She was the same way when she came to the lab. I guess this girl is just brimming with curiosity.
Rintaro: "Interested?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu quickly averts her eyes. But she doesn’t let go of my arm.
Rintaro: "You’re interested, aren’t you?"
Kurisu: "...Just a little."
Rintaro: "Then I shall answer! The IBN 5100 is the key to unlocking SERN’s most closely guarded secrets."
Kurisu: "SERN? You mean... the SERN?"
Rintaro: "Indeed. Through the tireless efforts of my faithful lab mems, we have uncovered evidence that SERN is researching time travel."
UNSPOKEN: Come! Be astonished!
Kurisu: "...Great. I shouldn’t have asked."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu gives me a cold glare, then lets go and starts walking away. This time, she’s gone for good. Damn you! Just you watch. I will expose SERN’s secrets if it’s the last thing I do! The next day, I decide to hit Akiba’s computer parts stores. I did as much as I could yesterday, after parting with Kurisu, but no luck. Finding an IBN 5100 is obviously going to be a huge pain in the ass.
Rintaro: "Hmmm..."
UNSPOKEN: I’m standing in the narrow tunnel that runs beside the Radi-Kan building. Small shops selling everything from motherboards to resistors to vacuum tubes line both sides of the tunnel. Here lie the vestiges of the old Electric Town. Akiba’s conscience, so to speak. Casual otaku usually avoid stores like these. It’s like a holy land that only true fanatics can enter. Not that I’m an expert on computer parts. Furthermore, these shops only sell parts, so it’s actually kind of silly to be searching for a whole PC here. Still, something about the sight of all these electronics gets my blood pumping.  I have to hide my excitement to maintain my dignity. If a storekeeper yells, Hey, kid! You’re ten years too young for this stuff! then I’ll have no choice but to run. Fortunately, no one has yelled at me yet. In fact, the storekeepers seem to be ignoring me. They must be more open-minded than I thought. Or maybe they just don’t care. I search each store in turn, but turn up neither hide nor hair of an IBN 5100. The ringing of my phone draws a sharp look from the nearest storekeeper. I force a smile and rush outside.
Rintaro: "It’s me. What’s up?"
Mayuri: "Tutturu♪ Mayushii here."
Rintaro: "I thought I told you not to contact me on this line. It could be tapped."
Mayuri: "Huhwha?"
