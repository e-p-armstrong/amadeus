Mayuri: Ahh! I didn't say you could have two!
Rintaro: Well done, Mayuri! I'll see that your information is put to good use!
Mayuri: My chicken...
Rintaro: By the way, what's this Feris Cup about?
Mayuri: My chicken...
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri is stuffing the remaining chicken into her mouth as fast as she can. There are tears in her eyes. Come on, it was just two.
Rintaro: Well, whatever. I'm uneasy about the lack of intel, but the mission must go on. Wait here, Mayuri. If I don't return within the hour, go home immediately. Understood?
Mayuri: I can't! I have to work.
UNSPOKEN: Anyway. Let's leave Mayuri to her chicken and begin the approach.
Faris: Welcome, Myaster♪
UNSPOKEN: When I enter the cafe, it's fully occupied, unlike usual.
Faris: Nyanya♪ Is Kyouma gonna join too? Today's the Faris Cup, nya!
UNSPOKEN: Doesn't look like she plans to explain what that is. I take my phone out again.
Rintaro: It's me. Run a search on the Faris Cup. ...What!? A battle to the death where the winner gets to use Faris however he pleases!? Looks like I've stepped into one hell of a mess. ...No, there's no problem. I'll survive... by any means necessary. El Psy Kongroo.
UNSPOKEN: I put away my phone and turn to Faris.
Rintaro: The Faris Cup is a battle royale, isn't it?
Faris: No, nya. It's a cat-eat-cat battle royale where the winner gets to make Faris his slave, nya. Ahh, no, you can't! You can't claw at each other's throats over Faris, nya! Please, stop nya!
UNSPOKEN: Faris starts crying and wriggling her body seductively. That's some pretty good acting, but of course, no one here is killing anyone.
Faris: Kyouma, please, nya. Stop them.
Rintaro: Don't worry. There's nobody for me to stop. Everyone's sitting silently in their seats.
UNSPOKEN: Nevertheless, the atmosphere here is different. I sense bloodlust in the air.
Rintaro: No, seriously, what's the Faris Cup?
Faris: A paw-to-paw contest with Faris nya. Faris goes at it with everyone at the same time nyan. A reward goes to those Faris finds worthy, nya.
UNSPOKEN: I gulp and look at Faris hard.
Rintaro: Faris, are you serious!?
UNSPOKEN: Going at it with all these men at the same time? She's insane. But Faris grins. A fang-like tooth peeks out from her glistening red lips.
Faris: ...If you don't do something, Faris is gonna become everyone's plaything, nya.
UNSPOKEN: Faris approaches me. Her slender fingers touch my arm. Her caress gives me goosebumps.
Faris: Save Faris's fur, Kyouma...
UNSPOKEN: I can't take my eyes off her. I've been entranced. This girl has the power to bend men to her will. I must resist.
Rintaro: I refuse!
Faris: NyaNya!?
