Mayuri: "Um, Okarin? Mayushii doesn’t know what that means..."
Rintaro: "I’m asking why you’re calling."
Mayuri: "Why didn’t you just say that? Um, what are you doing now?"
Rintaro: "Executing the mission."
Mayuri: "Executing the missus?"
Rintaro: "The mission! I’m looking for an IBN 5100!"
Mayuri: "Ehehe! Well why didn’t you say so? Mayushii heard something amazing just now. Wanna hear?"
Rintaro: "If it’s valuable information, then by all means."
Mayuri: "Well, then come to MayQueen! I’ll be waiting♪"
Rintaro: "Hey, tell me over the phone! Hey, Mayuri! Why do I have to go all the way to MayQueen..."
UNSPOKEN: I complain, but it’s less than a ten minute walk. Whatever. I haven’t had lunch, so I guess I’ll eat while I’m there. There’s a handwritten sign outside MayQueen that says Today’s the Faris Cup, nyan♪. While I’m trying to figure out what that means...
Mayuri: "Okarin!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri trots up to me in full maid regalia. She has a convenience store bag in hand.
Mayuri: "Mayushii went to the convenience store during lunch break."
UNSPOKEN: Then Mayuri takes out her pocket watch, Pockety. She checks the time.
Mayuri: "Now there’s only five minutes left!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri squats next to the stairs.
Rintaro: "Good work. So, what was that amazing thing you heard?"
Mayuri: "Before that, food."
UNSPOKEN: She takes some fried chicken out of the convenience store bag as she speaks. The aroma of the chicken stirs my appetite.
Rintaro: "Let me have one."
Mayuri: "Okay."
UNSPOKEN: She skewers a piece of chicken on a toothpick and holds it out for me.
Mayuri: "Here you go♪"
Rintaro: "You can’t do that in front of the store. You’re supposed to be a maid."
Mayuri: "So?"
Rintaro: "Here, you’re not Shiina Mayuri, but Mayushii NyanNyan. You can’t ’say aah’ in front of the store! Your customers are going to see that as an act of betrayal."
Mayuri: "Oh! Mayushii didn’t think of that."
UNSPOKEN: With that said, I take the chicken off the toothpick by hand and throw it into my mouth. Mmm, delicious. Not as good as Juicy Chicken Number One, though.
Rintaro: "Well? What was that amazing thing you heard?"
Mayuri: "Oh, right! Actually, it’s about the IBN 5100."
Rintaro: "You found a lead!? Of course, it was at MayQueen! I can’t believe I missed it!"
Mayuri: "No it’s not! That’s silly!"
UNSPOKEN: Damn! Don’t get my hopes up like that. Mayuri has a triumphant look on her face, but I don’t see where this is going at all.
Mayuri: "Mayushii was thinking of the IBN 5100 during work, so I asked the other girls if they knew anything. First I asked Makki-chan, but Makki-chan said she’s not good with computers. And then there’s LisaLisa-chan, but she only knows about the latest PCs. And she’s actually a Machead..."
