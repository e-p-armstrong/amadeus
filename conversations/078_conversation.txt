Rintaro: I didn't come to fight. I only came to talk to you.
Faris: If you're not going to play, then I'm sorry, but I'll have to ask you to leave, nya.
Rintaro: What's this? A maid, sending a customer away?
Faris: Faris is the organyaizer of the Faris Cup today. Only participants are allowed inside the shop, nya.
Rintaro: I only need two minutes. The IBN--
Faris: Not listening, nyan!
UNSPOKEN: Faris puts her hands over her ears. Her real ears, not the cat ears. Then she laughs mischievously.
Faris: If you want to talk to Faris, you have no choice but to join the Faris Cup, nyan.
Rintaro: ...Now that's just low.
Faris: So, what'll it be nyan? You can't survive unless you fight with your own paws, nyan!
UNSPOKEN: Use any method to obtain information. That's my current mission. I have to do it! No matter what lies ahead!
Rintaro: There's no choice. I accept your challenge. But on one condition.
UNSPOKEN: I thrust my finger at the tip of Faris' nose.
Rintaro: If I face you, you'll tell me everything you know!
Faris: NyaNya? Well, fine by me nya... Well then, Master, this way, nyannyanâ™ª
UNSPOKEN: She sticks a nametag onto my chest. The number 28 is written on it with round, girly numbers. I cautiously let Faris lead me to the back of the cafe, and finally learn what the customers are doing. Everyone's engrossed in some kind of card game. Now I remember. The other day, Faris said that she was doing a RaiNet AccessBattlers tournament. That's the Faris Cup. If you win, you get to eat Faris's home cooking, or something like that. Tch, looks like Faris tricked me. Save me, she said. Nya, she said. I knew she was not to be trifled with.
Itaru: Huh? Why are you here? You don't do RaiNet.
Rintaro: Wha, Daru!? What are you doing here!? What about SERN!?
Itaru: Let me rest for one day, man. You should treat me better after two consecutive all-nighters.
Rintaro: SERN's power grows stronger by the day, and here you are without a care in the world.
Itaru: You're here too.
Rintaro: I came here for an unrelated matter and got dragged into this nonsense. I'm not interested in RaiNet or Faris's home cooking.
UNSPOKEN: The second those words leave my lips, I feel like everyone in the store is glaring at me. They want my blood. Come to think of it, the Faris Cup was organized by Faris, so it makes sense that only Faris fans would participate. In other words, I'm the Away Team. Tch, I'm surrounded by enemies. But this is something I must do. This is just one more step on my road to the IBN 5100. Obtain information using any means necessary. With that mission in mind, I sit next to Daru and softly whisper to him.
Rintaro: Daru, Operation Sigma.
