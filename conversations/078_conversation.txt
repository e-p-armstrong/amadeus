Mayuri: "Hm? Um, well, I think Feris-chan knows."
Rintaro: "What!? Is that true!?"
Mayuri: "Yup. Did you know she’s a retro PC maniac?"
Rintaro: "Faris?"
UNSPOKEN: That girl is seriously hardcore. I’d prefer to stay away from her if possible. But I’m really desperate for information. I take out my phone and put it to my ear.
Rintaro: "It’s me. Looks like we’ve got a lead on the IBN 5100. Are you ready for this? It’s Faris NyanNyan. It turns out that catgirl’s an expert on retro PCs. There’s probably another side to this. Let’s keep our eyes peeled. ...Hmph. I suppose I’m the only man for the job. Very well. I’ll make the approach. If you don’t hear from me by 2000 hours tonight, then forget about me and commence the strike on MayQueen. Everything is the choice of Steins Gate... El Psy Kongroo."
UNSPOKEN: I put away my phone, grab another piece of chicken, and look up at MayQueen’s window.
Mayuri: "Ahh! I didn’t say you could have two!"
Rintaro: "Well done, Mayuri! I’ll see that your information is put to good use!"
Mayuri: "My chicken..."
Rintaro: "By the way, what’s this Feris Cup about?"
Mayuri: "My chicken..."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri is stuffing the remaining chicken into her mouth as fast as she can. There are tears in her eyes. Come on, it was just two.
Rintaro: "Well, whatever. I’m uneasy about the lack of intel, but the mission must go on. Wait here, Mayuri. If I don’t return within the hour, go home immediately. Understood?"
Mayuri: "I can’t! I have to work."
UNSPOKEN: Anyway. Let’s leave Mayuri to her chicken and begin the approach.
Faris: "Welcome, Myaster♪"
UNSPOKEN: When I enter the cafe, it’s fully occupied, unlike usual.
Faris: "Nyanya♪ Is Kyouma gonna join too? Today’s the Faris Cup, nya!"
UNSPOKEN: Doesn’t look like she plans to explain what that is. I take my phone out again.
Rintaro: "It’s me. Run a search on the Faris Cup. ...What!? A battle to the death where the winner gets to use Faris however he pleases!? Looks like I’ve stepped into one hell of a mess. ...No, there’s no problem. I’ll survive... by any means necessary. El Psy Kongroo."
UNSPOKEN: I put away my phone and turn to Faris.
Rintaro: "The Faris Cup is a battle royale, isn’t it?"
Faris: "No, nya. It’s a cat-eat-cat battle royale where the winner gets to make Faris his slave, nya. Ahh, no, you can’t! You can’t claw at each other’s throats over Faris, nya! Please, stop nya!"
