Rintaro: "Don’t worry. There’s nobody for me to stop. Everyone’s sitting silently in their seats."
UNSPOKEN: Nevertheless, the atmosphere here is different. I sense bloodlust in the air.
Rintaro: "No, seriously, what’s the Faris Cup?"
Faris: "A paw-to-paw contest with Faris nya. Faris goes at it with everyone at the same time nyan. A reward goes to those Faris finds worthy, nya."
UNSPOKEN: I gulp and look at Faris hard.
Rintaro: "Faris, are you serious!?"
UNSPOKEN: Going at it with all these men at the same time? She’s insane. But Faris grins. A fang-like tooth peeks out from her glistening red lips.
Faris: "...If you don’t do something, Faris is gonna become everyone’s plaything, nya."
UNSPOKEN: Faris approaches me. Her slender fingers touch my arm. Her caress gives me goosebumps.
Faris: "Save Faris’s fur, Kyouma..."
UNSPOKEN: I can’t take my eyes off her. I’ve been entranced. This girl has the power to bend men to her will. I must resist.
Rintaro: "I refuse!"
Faris: "NyaNya!?"
UNSPOKEN: I shake her paws off. Phew, that was close. She has one hell of an evil eye. I barely escaped enticement, and only because I am the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma.
Rintaro: "I didn’t come to fight. I only came to talk to you."
Faris: "If you’re not going to play, then I’m sorry, but I’ll have to ask you to leave, nya."
Rintaro: "What’s this? A maid, sending a customer away?"
Faris: "Faris is the organyaizer of the Faris Cup today. Only participants are allowed inside the shop, nya."
Rintaro: "I only need two minutes. The IBN--"
Faris: "Not listening, nyan!"
UNSPOKEN: Faris puts her hands over her ears. Her real ears, not the cat ears. Then she laughs mischievously.
Faris: "If you want to talk to Faris, you have no choice but to join the Faris Cup, nyan."
Rintaro: "...Now that’s just low."
Faris: "So, what’ll it be nyan? You can’t survive unless you fight with your own paws, nyan!"
UNSPOKEN: Use any method to obtain information. That’s my current mission. I have to do it! No matter what lies ahead!
Rintaro: "There’s no choice. I accept your challenge. But on one condition."
UNSPOKEN: I thrust my finger at the tip of Faris’ nose.
Rintaro: "If I face you, you’ll tell me everything you know!"
Faris: "NyaNya? Well, fine by me nya... Well then, Master, this way, nyannyan♪"
