Rintaro: I'm saying we should cooperate. We'll be the strongest if we team up, right?
Itaru: More like you're gonna drag me down. You're a noob at this game, Okarin.
Rintaro: But you're my right-hand man. As long as we're together, we have nothing to fear.
UNSPOKEN: Daru flashes his white teeth in a grin.
Itaru: But I refuse. I'm in this thing to win.
Rintaro: And you call yourself my friend!?
Itaru: In this tournament, we're enemies.
Rintaro: You traitor! Why do you think I sent you into this cafe as a spy?
Itaru: But you didn't send me. I'm Faris-tan's biggest fan. I check her blog every day and--
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly the cafe's lights dim. A song starts playing. A somewhat solemn melody, with sexy and powerful female vocals. I've heard this song a lot recently. Pretty sure it's the theme song to RaiNet Kakeru.
Faris: Hi everyone♪ Thanks for waiting, nyan! The afternoon Faris Cup is about to begin nya!
UNSPOKEN: Faris appears in a spotlight. The previously peaceful audience instantly explodes in excitement. Everyone stands up and shouts in unison with their fists raised skyward.
Faris: Thank you, nya!
UNSPOKEN: Faris responds to the shouts of joy with a wave of her hand, then clears her throat.
Faris: The rules are simple. Faris will face off against each one of you nya. Faris will even go paw-to-paw with ten people at once, nyan. If you beat Faris, you'll get her home cooking as a reward, nya. Now then, everyone! Enjoy the contest!
UNSPOKEN: Lots are drawn to determine the order we face Faris. Seems like there are 28 participants, including me. Faris will face ten people at the same time, so she divides us into three rounds. I'm in the third round.
Itaru: Gwah... strong Faris is strong...
UNSPOKEN: Daru, a first-round participant, was insta-killed by Faris. How weak. And he said I was going to be the burden. No, maybe Faris is just too strong. RaiNet AccessBattlers is similar to chess. There's a special board where you compete using pieces arranged in rows. The rules are fairly complicated, but basically, the point of the game is to get your pieces into the enemy camp. Whoever gets the most pieces into the enemy camp wins. Faris is playing against ten people at once. She moves from table to table in a circle, taking one move at each before proceeding to the next. In go, shogi, and chess, this is called a simultaneous exhibition. High-level players hold them to demonstrate their skill. And Faris does indeed seem to be highly skilled, just as Daru said. All ten of the first-round participants are annihilated within 15 minutes.
Faris: Nyahaha♪ I hope the next group tries a little harder nyan.
