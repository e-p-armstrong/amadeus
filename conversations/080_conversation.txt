Rintaro: Whew... Lukako. Foolish disciple of mine. From now on, you shall go into battle equipped with that costume and Samidare.
Luka: Eh...
Mayuri: Ehh? Kirari-chan doesn't have a sword! He should carry an Upa instead♪
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri, in high spirits, makes Lukako hold the Upa cushion. His lips tremble as he reluctantly accepts the cushion. He clearly doesn't know what to do with it.
Rintaro: The Organization is making a move on Akiba.
UNSPOKEN: I pretend not to notice Lukako's distress.
Rintaro: You are the guardian who protects this chaotic metropolis. Miko of Yanabayashi Shrine, now is the time for you to fulfill that duty! Understand, Lukako? This is the reason I'm so hard on you. You have a duty to protect this town!
Luka: Do I... really?
Rintaro: You certainly do! Muhahaha!
Kurisu: Can you stop that vulgar laughter? I can hear you from outside. It's embarrassing.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu enters the lab with those remarks. She's coming in late, like she's a company executive or something.
Mayuri: Chris-chan, tutturu♪
Rintaro: Mmgh!? You come here this late and dare insult me? And you call yourself my assistant!?
Kurisu: I'm not your assistant. Don't make me repeat myself. Anyway! You're the worst, toying with such a weak and innocent girl. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Itaru: Toying with a weak and innocent girl, you say?
Kurisu: Don't react to every little thing, you perv.
UNSPOKEN: That's right. Christina doesn't know Lukako's a guy. Correcting it is a pain, so I don't say anything.
Kurisu: At any rate...
Rintaro: Christina. Stop eying Lukako's entire body from top to bottom like that.
Kurisu: I-I wasn't doing that!
Mayuri: Do you like the costume, Chris-chan? It really suits Luka-kun, dontcha think?
Kurisu: Is this that cosplay thing I've heard about? It's part of Japanimation culture, right? You're very cute.
Luka: C-c-cute? No way...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako's eyes get wetter and wetter.
Kurisu: Why are you crying? You look perfect, so you should be more confident.
Luka: Uuugh...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu doesn't know, so she's not doing it intentionally, but I guess that makes things complicated for Lukako. I should change the topic for Lukako's sake. While I am a mad scientist, I also happen to be a perfect gentleman!
Rintaro: Heh heh heh...
UNSPOKEN: I comb back my hair with my fingers.
Rintaro: Lukako! Tell us your wish.
Luka: Eh...?
Kurisu: That's one hell of an acrobatic topic change.
Rintaro: Listen, Lukako! Your desires can become reality. Japan is a land of great spiritual power. It resides in every word that slips from your tongue! Now that you too have joined the otaku world, you need conceal your deepest desires no longer! Speak your wish with a true heart, and by the chaos that rules Akihabara, Steins Gate shall grant it!
Luka: My... wish?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako puts his hands together in front of his waist and bends his head slightly to the side. His cheeks turn light pink. His bashful, squirming appearance with wet, upturned eyes would make anyone who saw him either want to hug him real tight, or smack him upside the head. It's that damn powerful.
Luka: Well... If I tell you... promise not to laugh?
Rintaro: There's nothing to be embarrassed about. Just proclaim it to the world!
Kurisu: Well yeah, no wish is embarrassing compared to the idiotic wish for chaos to envelop the world or whatever.
