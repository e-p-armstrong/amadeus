UNSPOKEN: Mayuri returns from her break with a drink in hand and whispers to me.
Mayuri: Mayushii's bad at RaiNet, so I'm really jealous.
Rintaro: What would you do if you were good at it?
Mayuri: Don't you know? RaiNet AccessBattlers isn't just popular in Akiba. It's a global blend!
UNSPOKEN: Blend? So... it's coffee?
Rintaro: I think you mean trend.
Mayuri: Yeah, that. So if you get good at it, you're sure to be every kid's hero!
Rintaro: Hero, huh... That doesn't sound bad.
Mayuri: Besides, Upa is so cute♪
UNSPOKEN: Upa, as everyone knows, is RaiNet's mascot character. These days he's more popular than that electric yellow rat.
Rintaro: Wait. There's something strange about your argument. How does RaiNet skill relate to Upa's cuteness?
UNSPOKEN: I guess they're related in Mayuri's mind. She must be after those limited Upa plushes they give out to participants in official tournaments. You'll never become the strongest with such impure intentions, Mayuri.
Mayuri: Feris-chan's too busy to go to tournaments, but I think she's definitely a world-class player.
UNSPOKEN: If that's the case, these faceless rabble participating in the Faris Cup are unworthy opponents. Just as expected, round 2 ends the same as round 1. Nobody's even close to Faris's level.
Faris: NyanNyan. Sorry, nya, but Faris never pulls punches in RaiNet. I want someone who can go paw-to-paw with me, nyan.
Itaru: Gwohh! Feris-tan is too strong! We can't win. It was hopeless from the get-go!
UNSPOKEN: A thick mood of defeat has already spread across the challengers. Some of them are even on their knees in shame.
Rintaro: Hmph! You're all pathetic.
UNSPOKEN: I stride to the front of the crowd. I nonchalantly meet Faris's questioning gaze.
Rintaro: But we've been saving the best for last. Daru! Allow me to show you... how a true man fights.
Itaru: Don't tell me you've got a plan?
Rintaro: Hmph. Indeed I do. Let's just call this Operation 'Sweet Side'.
UNSPOKEN: A loud 'ohh!' echoes from all around me. Those cruelly defeated by Faris entrust their hopes unto me... unto us all, the eight Round 3 participants. I can feel their pain. It gives me strength. At first, we were enemies. But now, our hearts are joined against the indomitable might of Faris.
Faris: So Kyouma thinks he's up to par, nya?
Rintaro: The tears of the fallen twenty... shall not be in vain. Do you remember our promise, Faris? Once this match is over, you'll tell me everything you know.
Itaru: Amazing! That crazy bastard actually means to win!
Mayuri: Go for it, Okarin♪
UNSPOKEN: The crowd goes wild. They place their hopes on me. I slowly step up to the table.
Rintaro: Five minutes. That's all it will take to decide the match.
