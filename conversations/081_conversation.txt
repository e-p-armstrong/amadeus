UNSPOKEN: Daru, a first-round participant, was insta-killed by Faris. How weak. And he said I was going to be the burden. No, maybe Faris is just too strong. RaiNet AccessBattlers is similar to chess. There’s a special board where you compete using pieces arranged in rows. The rules are fairly complicated, but basically, the point of the game is to get your pieces into the enemy camp. Whoever gets the most pieces into the enemy camp wins. Faris is playing against ten people at once. She moves from table to table in a circle, taking one move at each before proceeding to the next. In go, shogi, and chess, this is called a simultaneous exhibition. High-level players hold them to demonstrate their skill. And Faris does indeed seem to be highly skilled, just as Daru said. All ten of the first-round participants are annihilated within 15 minutes.
Faris: "Nyahaha♪ I hope the next group tries a little harder nyan."
UNSPOKEN: Damn you, Faris. Don’t get cocky. I lean back against the wall and silently watch the round 2 matches.
Mayuri: "Feris-chan sure is strong."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri returns from her break with a drink in hand and whispers to me.
Mayuri: "Mayushii’s bad at RaiNet, so I’m really jealous."
Rintaro: "What would you do if you were good at it?"
Mayuri: "Don’t you know? RaiNet AccessBattlers isn’t just popular in Akiba. It’s a global blend!"
UNSPOKEN: Blend? So... it’s coffee?
Rintaro: "I think you mean trend."
Mayuri: "Yeah, that. So if you get good at it, you’re sure to be every kid’s hero!"
Rintaro: "Hero, huh... That doesn’t sound bad."
Mayuri: "Besides, Upa is so cute♪"
UNSPOKEN: Upa, as everyone knows, is RaiNet’s mascot character. These days he’s more popular than that electric yellow rat.
Rintaro: "Wait. There’s something strange about your argument. How does RaiNet skill relate to Upa’s cuteness?"
UNSPOKEN: I guess they’re related in Mayuri’s mind. She must be after those limited Upa plushes they give out to participants in official tournaments. You’ll never become the strongest with such impure intentions, Mayuri.
Mayuri: "Feris-chan’s too busy to go to tournaments, but I think she’s definitely a world-class player."
UNSPOKEN: If that’s the case, these faceless rabble participating in the Faris Cup are unworthy opponents. Just as expected, round 2 ends the same as round 1. Nobody’s even close to Faris’s level.
Faris: "NyanNyan. Sorry, nya, but Faris never pulls punches in RaiNet. I want someone who can go paw-to-paw with me, nyan."
Itaru: "Gwohh! Feris-tan is too strong! We can’t win. It was hopeless from the get-go!"
