Rintaro: I give up.
UNSPOKEN: It didn't even take five minutes.
Itaru: You're weak! Too weak!
UNSPOKEN: Obviously! I've never played RaiNet AccessBattlers before! There's no way I can win if I don't even know the rules! By the way, I'm not alone. All eight of the third-round contestants were blown out. And thus, the tournament ends in total victory for Faris.
Mayuri: Mayushii's disappointed...
Itaru: So it was all a bluff!? What happened to Operation 'Sweet Side'!?
Faris: It was almost like Kyouma committed suicide, nya.
Itaru: Wait, don't tell me...
Rintaro: Muhahaha! Yes! It's exactly what you're thinking!
UNSPOKEN: I leap onto a chair and strike an awesome pose, bathing the losers below me in scorn. Why the long faces, men!?
Rintaro: Operation Sweet Side was a suicide attack!
Itaru: That's gotta be the worst pun ever!
UNSPOKEN: I don't know the rules. What else could I do?
Faris: But why are you so proud even though I made kitty litter outta you, nya?
Rintaro: Heh heh heh. Have you not figured it out, Faris NyanNyan!? Win or lose, it made no difference.
Faris: What's that supposed to mean, nya?
Rintaro: Do you remember the conditions I set?
Faris: Mya? If Faris lost, then she'd tell you everything--
Rintaro: No! You are wrong, Faris. What I said was... 'If I face you, you'll tell me everything you know!' If I face you. Now do you understand? I never needed to win! No one else could have pulled it off. These fools were lured here by the prospect of Faris's home cooking. They were obsessed with winning. But not I! Your home cooking meant nothing to me! That difference in motivation is what allowed this suicide mission to succeed! Heh heh heh, muhahahaha, MUHAHAHAHAHA!
UNSPOKEN: My laughter echoes throughout the cafe. Everyone is staring at me in disbelief. Mayuri's the only one to applaud.
Mayuri: Wow, Okarin! You're amazing!
Itaru: Th-that's dirty...
Rintaro: I think you mean fiendishly clever! Behold the success of Operation Sweet Side!
UNSPOKEN: I get off the chair and walk to Faris.
Rintaro: Now, Faris. Answer me. Where is the IBN 5100!?
Faris: Nya? The IBN 5100?
Rintaro: Don't play dumb. I have a reliable source.
UNSPOKEN: I remember that image of the IBN 5100 Shining Finger sent me. I bring it up on my phone and show it to Faris.
Rintaro: I know that you have information on the IBN 5100.
Faris: Nya... how do you expect me to remember that, nya? Though I think I've seen this computer before...
Rintaro: What!? I thought you were an expert on retro PCs! Mayuri told me so!
Itaru: Uh, you leaked your source...
Mayuri: Yup! Mayushii's a reliable source!
Faris: I'm not an expert, nya. Papa collected them, so we've got tons at home, that's all.
