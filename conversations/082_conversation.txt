UNSPOKEN: I stride to the front of the crowd. I nonchalantly meet Faris’s questioning gaze.
Rintaro: "But we’ve been saving the best for last. Daru! Allow me to show you... how a true man fights."
Itaru: "Don’t tell me you’ve got a plan?"
Rintaro: "Hmph. Indeed I do. Let’s just call this Operation ’Sweet Side’."
UNSPOKEN: A loud ’ohh!’ echoes from all around me. Those cruelly defeated by Faris entrust their hopes unto me... unto us all, the eight Round 3 participants. I can feel their pain. It gives me strength. At first, we were enemies. But now, our hearts are joined against the indomitable might of Faris.
Faris: "So Kyouma thinks he’s up to par, nya?"
Rintaro: "The tears of the fallen twenty... shall not be in vain. Do you remember our promise, Faris? Once this match is over, you’ll tell me everything you know."
Itaru: "Amazing! That crazy bastard actually means to win!"
Mayuri: "Go for it, Okarin♪"
UNSPOKEN: The crowd goes wild. They place their hopes on me. I slowly step up to the table.
Rintaro: "Five minutes. That’s all it will take to decide the match."
Faris: "Okay! Round 3, start nya♪ RaiNet AccesssBattlers, duel access!"
Rintaro: "I give up."
UNSPOKEN: It didn’t even take five minutes.
Itaru: "You’re weak! Too weak!"
UNSPOKEN: Obviously! I’ve never played RaiNet AccessBattlers before! There’s no way I can win if I don’t even know the rules! By the way, I’m not alone. All eight of the third-round contestants were blown out. And thus, the tournament ends in total victory for Faris.
Mayuri: "Mayushii’s disappointed..."
Itaru: "So it was all a bluff!? What happened to Operation ’Sweet Side’!?"
Faris: "It was almost like Kyouma committed suicide, nya."
Itaru: "Wait, don’t tell me..."
Rintaro: "Muhahaha! Yes! It’s exactly what you’re thinking!"
UNSPOKEN: I leap onto a chair and strike an awesome pose, bathing the losers below me in scorn. Why the long faces, men!?
Rintaro: "Operation Sweet Side was a suicide attack!"
Itaru: "That’s gotta be the worst pun ever!"
UNSPOKEN: I don’t know the rules. What else could I do?
Faris: "But why are you so proud even though I made kitty litter outta you, nya?"
Rintaro: "Heh heh heh. Have you not figured it out, Faris NyanNyan!? Win or lose, it made no difference."
Faris: "What’s that supposed to mean, nya?"
Rintaro: "Do you remember the conditions I set?"
Faris: "Mya? If Faris lost, then she’d tell you everything--"
Rintaro: "No! You are wrong, Faris. What I said was... ’If I face you, you’ll tell me everything you know!’ If I face you. Now do you understand? I never needed to win! No one else could have pulled it off. These fools were lured here by the prospect of Faris’s home cooking. They were obsessed with winning. But not I! Your home cooking meant nothing to me! That difference in motivation is what allowed this suicide mission to succeed! Heh heh heh, muhahahaha, MUHAHAHAHAHA!"
