Faris: I can't, nyan.
Rintaro: What!? Why!?
UNSPOKEN: Faris puts on a bewitching smile.
Faris: Because that's the Faris Clan's sanctuary.
UNSPOKEN: The... Faris Clan?
Faris: The only ones who may enter are the Faris Clan's cat-eared daughters: those who purrsue the knowledge of the meow miko. In other words, it's paws-off to everybody but Faris, nya. Try to force your way in... and you'll grow dog ears, nya!
Rintaro: Like hell I will! Dog ears!? Yeah right!
Faris: I-it's true, nya... Faris doesn't tell tall tails, nya...
UNSPOKEN: She suddenly starts acting like a scared little catgirl. Instantly, the air is charged with malice. I find myself surrounded by 27 Faris fans, each glaring at me with bloodshot eyes.
Rintaro: You coward! You've converted your believers into your personal army!
Faris: Faris is only telling the truth, nya...
UNSPOKEN: The defeated are now under Faris's complete control. They approach at a shuffle, muttering foul prayers to their cat goddess. Crap. These guys are serious. I need the information Faris possesses, but I'm at too great a disadvantage now to press the attack. And then there's my personal weakness to Faris's powers. At this rate, I might be assimilated into the Faris cult. What do I do!?
Rintaro: Gwaahhh!

UNSPOKEN: My right hand trembles. I show agony on my face as I try desperately to control the trembling.
Faris: No! Don't tell me! Is the Anti-RaiNet System activating!? I warned you playing RaiNet could kill you!
UNSPOKEN: What? Where did that come from!? I ignore Faris and stagger towards the exit. Her worshippers let me pass. It feels as if everyone is giving me cold stares, but I don't have the time to check and make sure. I throw myself out the door and into open air.
Rintaro: Damn, empty handed...
UNSPOKEN: The throbbing in my right arm settles as soon as I leave the cafe. I guess I'll ask Daru or Mayuri about Faris some other day. It feels like all of my exhaustion has caught up with me. And to make matters worse, it's boiling hot today. The sun's getting stronger as we enter August. Fed up with the heat, I wipe the sweat off my brow.
Mayuri: Okarin!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri chases after me. She's smiling and waving at me, but her speed is clearly faster than mine.
Rintaro: What happened? Is the Faris Cup already over?
Mayuri: Nope. Well, just about. After this, the customers get to chat with Feris-chan. I wanted to tell you about that IBN 5100 thing. I showed Feris-chan the picture again.
Rintaro: Good work, Mayuri! Completely different from a certain useless super hacka! So?
Mayuri: Feris-chan said it was probably around the time she was in elementary school. On a cold autumn day, while Feris-chan was shivering from the cold, her butler Kuroki-san came to help--
