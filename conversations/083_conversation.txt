Mayuri: "Wow, Okarin! You’re amazing!"
Itaru: "Th-that’s dirty..."
Rintaro: "I think you mean fiendishly clever! Behold the success of Operation Sweet Side!"
UNSPOKEN: I get off the chair and walk to Faris.
Rintaro: "Now, Faris. Answer me. Where is the IBN 5100!?"
Faris: "Nya? The IBN 5100?"
Rintaro: "Don’t play dumb. I have a reliable source."
UNSPOKEN: I remember that image of the IBN 5100 Shining Finger sent me. I bring it up on my phone and show it to Faris.
Rintaro: "I know that you have information on the IBN 5100."
Faris: "Nya... how do you expect me to remember that, nya? Though I think I’ve seen this computer before..."
Rintaro: "What!? I thought you were an expert on retro PCs! Mayuri told me so!"
Itaru: "Uh, you leaked your source..."
Mayuri: "Yup! Mayushii’s a reliable source!"
Faris: "I’m not an expert, nya. Papa collected them, so we’ve got tons at home, that’s all."
Rintaro: "So that must be where the IBN 5100 is sealed! Take me there at once!"
Faris: "I can’t, nyan."
Rintaro: "What!? Why!?"
UNSPOKEN: Faris puts on a bewitching smile.
Faris: "Because that’s the Faris Clan’s sanctuary."
UNSPOKEN: The... Faris Clan?
Faris: "The only ones who may enter are the Faris Clan’s cat-eared daughters: those who purrsue the knowledge of the meow miko. In other words, it’s paws-off to everybody but Faris, nya. Try to force your way in... and you’ll grow dog ears, nya!"
Rintaro: "Like hell I will! Dog ears!? Yeah right!"
Faris: "I-it’s true, nya... Faris doesn’t tell tall tails, nya..."
UNSPOKEN: She suddenly starts acting like a scared little catgirl. Instantly, the air is charged with malice. I find myself surrounded by 27 Faris fans, each glaring at me with bloodshot eyes.
Rintaro: "You coward! You’ve converted your believers into your personal army!"
Faris: "Faris is only telling the truth, nya..."
UNSPOKEN: The defeated are now under Faris’s complete control. They approach at a shuffle, muttering foul prayers to their cat goddess. Crap. These guys are serious. I need the information Faris possesses, but I’m at too great a disadvantage now to press the attack. And then there’s my personal weakness to Faris’s powers. At this rate, I might be assimilated into the Faris cult. What do I do!?
Rintaro: "Gwaahhh!"
UNSPOKEN: I cry out and seize my right wrist.
Rintaro: "No, n-not now... it’s too soon!"
UNSPOKEN: My right hand trembles. I show agony on my face as I try desperately to control the trembling.
Faris: "No! Don’t tell me! Is the Anti-RaiNet System activating!? I warned you playing RaiNet could kill you!"
