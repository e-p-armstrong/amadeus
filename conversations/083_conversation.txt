Mayuri: So basically, she ended up donating one of her dad's computers to a shrine. She says it looked just like the one you're looking for.
Rintaro: Donated it... to a shrine?
UNSPOKEN: That's an unexpected combination. PCs... and shrines. Consumer electronics... and ancient Shinto rituals. They're not even tangentially related.
Rintaro: Which shrine?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri tilts her head in confusion.
Mayuri: Dunno. Where could it be?
UNSPOKEN: You didn't ask her?
Rintaro: Whatever. It's a lead.
UNSPOKEN: The only shrines in Akiba are Kanda Myojin and Yanabayashi Shrine. I don't know if Faris was living in Akiba at the time, but at least it's a start.
Rintaro: Good work, Mayuri. Continue your espionage mission.
Mayuri: SPN hodge?
Rintaro: Whatever, it doesn't matter. Bye.
Mayuri: Okay! Bye byeâ™ª
UNSPOKEN: Instead of returning to work, she keeps waving to me until I've vanished from sight. Whew, that was close. I probably shouldn't go back in there today. I take a deep breath to calm myself down. That's when something strange catches my eye. There's a woman squatting on the ground nearby, her knees against her chest. In her hand is a gaudy purple phone. She's staring at the screen without moving a muscle. She's even more conspicuous since nobody else is around. And on further inspection, I realize it's someone I know.
Rintaro: Shining Finger!
UNSPOKEN: I call out to her, but she gives me no reaction. Shining Finger is just a name I made up, so I guess it's only natural. Umm, her name was Moe... Moekko? No...
Rintaro: Finger!
UNSPOKEN: I stand in front of her and call her name -- well, the name I gave her -- but she doesn't even look at me. Her fingers are typing rapidly on her phone, so she's definitely conscious. But she still looks dead. There's no life in her eyes. I'm actually worried. Despite the heat, she's not sweating at all.
Rintaro: Can't you hear me?
Moeka: ...Who?
Rintaro: Hououin Kyouma! The mad scientist.
