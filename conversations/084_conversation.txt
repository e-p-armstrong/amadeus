Rintaro: "Damn, empty handed..."
UNSPOKEN: The throbbing in my right arm settles as soon as I leave the cafe. I guess I’ll ask Daru or Mayuri about Faris some other day. It feels like all of my exhaustion has caught up with me. And to make matters worse, it’s boiling hot today. The sun’s getting stronger as we enter August. Fed up with the heat, I wipe the sweat off my brow.
Mayuri: "Okarin!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri chases after me. She’s smiling and waving at me, but her speed is clearly faster than mine.
Rintaro: "What happened? Is the Faris Cup already over?"
Mayuri: "Nope. Well, just about. After this, the customers get to chat with Feris-chan. I wanted to tell you about that IBN 5100 thing. I showed Feris-chan the picture again."
Rintaro: "Good work, Mayuri! Completely different from a certain useless super hacka! So?"
Mayuri: "Feris-chan said it was probably around the time she was in elementary school. On a cold autumn day, while Feris-chan was shivering from the cold, her butler Kuroki-san came to help--"
Rintaro: "I don’t care about her butler! Just get to the point!"
Mayuri: "So basically, she ended up donating one of her dad’s computers to a shrine. She says it looked just like the one you’re looking for."
Rintaro: "Donated it... to a shrine?"
UNSPOKEN: That’s an unexpected combination. PCs... and shrines. Consumer electronics... and ancient Shinto rituals. They’re not even tangentially related.
Rintaro: "Which shrine?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri tilts her head in confusion.
Mayuri: "Dunno. Where could it be?"
UNSPOKEN: You didn’t ask her?
Rintaro: "Whatever. It’s a lead."
UNSPOKEN: The only shrines in Akiba are Kanda Myojin and Yanabayashi Shrine. I don’t know if Faris was living in Akiba at the time, but at least it’s a start.
Rintaro: "Good work, Mayuri. Continue your espionage mission."
Mayuri: "SPN hodge?"
Rintaro: "Whatever, it doesn’t matter. Bye."
Mayuri: "Okay! Bye bye♪"
UNSPOKEN: Instead of returning to work, she keeps waving to me until I’ve vanished from sight. Whew, that was close. I probably shouldn’t go back in there today. I take a deep breath to calm myself down. That’s when something strange catches my eye. There’s a woman squatting on the ground nearby, her knees against her chest. In her hand is a gaudy purple phone. She’s staring at the screen without moving a muscle. She’s even more conspicuous since nobody else is around. And on further inspection, I realize it’s someone I know.
Rintaro: "Shining Finger!"
UNSPOKEN: I call out to her, but she gives me no reaction. Shining Finger is just a name I made up, so I guess it’s only natural. Umm, her name was Moe... Moekko? No...
Rintaro: "Finger!"
