Rintaro: Hm? I didn't quite hear you.
UNSPOKEN: Moeka types out a mail at high speed. She's useless.
Rintaro: Don't worry. I have a network of informants at my disposal. Finding a retro PC should be no trouble at all.
UNSPOKEN: Moeka looks at me for the first time today. I see respect in her eyes.
Rintaro: Have you forgotten who I am? Hououin Kyouma! I will stop at nothing to destroy the System and usher in a new era of chaos! Muhahaha!
Moeka: That's... Okabe-kun's Steins Gate...
Rintaro: Not Okabe! Hououin!
UNSPOKEN: After parting with Shining Finger, I go to a nearby PC store to talk to an employee I happen to know. But naturally, he doesn't know where to find an IBN 5100 either. Apparently, it was easier to find retro PCs ten years ago, back when there were more underground niche stores. Now those stores are all but vanished, driven out by stricter regulations and the inexorable spread of moe culture. So I can't really say it's Moeka's fault that she's not useful. After all, I'm stumped too, and this is only my second day searching. Hunting for an IBN 5100 on a internet auction site is starting to look more appealing than confining my search to Akiba. But again, that would take time and money. That reminds me, Mayuri called before I met with Shining Finger. It's rare for the absent-minded Mayuri to be the one to contact me. I'm usually the one to contact her. I wonder what she wanted. Should I try calling her back? But where could she be now? She's not at work, is she? If she is, then I probably won't be able to get ahold of her.
Mayuri: Tutturuâ™ª Mayushii here.
Rintaro: It's me. What's the situation?
Mayuri: Okarin! I just called you!
Rintaro: Yeah. Did something happen?
Mayuri: Actually, try calling Daru-kun.
Rintaro: What? Why?
Mayuri: Daru-kun's at MayQueen right now. You should call him. He'll tell you. Bye bye!
Rintaro: Wait! Hey, Mayuri! Hey!
UNSPOKEN: She hung up. Doesn't look like she wants to explain. Even if I call back, Mayuri will probably just say the same thing. Let's do what Mayuri said. Crap, I messed up. I called someone else.
Itaru: What's up?
Rintaro: It's me. Report the situation.
Itaru: Okarin? You're the only one who talks like that. Did you hear from Mayu-shi?
Rintaro: No, she didn't tell me anything.
Itaru: Well, I'm at MayQueen right now. Mayu-shi did some investigating. Sounds like Faris-tan knows about the IBN 5100.
Rintaro: What!? Faris!?
UNSPOKEN: Don't tell me that catgirl and the IBN 5100 are connected somehow. I can't even imagine how they could be.
Itaru: I understand your confusion, but apparently there are a lot of retro PCs at her home.
