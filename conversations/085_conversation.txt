Rintaro: This too is the choice of Steins Gate!
Itaru: I don't get you.
Rintaro: So, is Faris there?
Itaru: Of course. Today's the Faris Cup.
UNSPOKEN: Faris Cup? What's that? I think I remember hearing about it, but I never really paid it any attention.
Itaru: When I showed Faris-tan an image of the IBN 5100, she said she donated a similar PC to a shrine ten years ago. Dunno if it's the one we want, though.
Rintaro: She donated it... to a shrine?
UNSPOKEN: That's an unexpected combination. PCs... and shrines. Consumer electronics... and ancient Shinto rituals. They're not even tangentially related.
Rintaro: Which shrine?
Itaru: Uh, didn't ask. My bad.
Rintaro: Whatever. It's a lead.
UNSPOKEN: The only shrines in Akiba are Kanda Myojin and Yanabayashi Shrine. I don't know if Faris was living in Akiba at the time, but at least it's a start.
Itaru: Well, I'm hanging up. The Faris Cup is about to begin.
Rintaro: I see. Daru, I'm sure you can do it. Be sure to win.
Itaru: Leave it to me!
UNSPOKEN: What the hell is a Faris Cup anyway? No, more importantly, the shrine. Let's contact her, not by phone, but by email. I send an email and get a reply in a matter of minutes. That's it? Call Daru? What does this mean? I guess there's no choice. I'll call Daru. Kanda Myojin is the larger and more popular shrine, so nine out of ten people would choose to donate something there. But when I inquire at the shrine office, nobody knows anything about an old computer. That leaves Yanabayashi Shrine. It's probably not there either, but I have to try. If that fails, I'll have to search all of Tokyo's shrines one by one. The thought alone makes me dizzy, so I set it aside for now.
Rintaro: Who is this?
UNSPOKEN: What? All I can hear is noise. Wrong number? No, maybe--
Rintaro: You're from the Organization, aren't you? Is this a warning? You telling me to stop getting involved with SERN?
???: Huh?
UNSPOKEN: Hm? It's a woman's voice. And she clearly doesn't understand what I'm talking about.
Rintaro: You're not from the Organization?
???: ...No. It's Makise.
Rintaro: Makise...
