UNSPOKEN: That’s some unexpected good news. The tables have turned, and now I’m close to my goal.
Rintaro: "This too is the choice of Steins Gate!"
Itaru: "I don’t get you."
Rintaro: "So, is Faris there?"
Itaru: "Of course. Today’s the Faris Cup."
UNSPOKEN: Faris Cup? What’s that? I think I remember hearing about it, but I never really paid it any attention.
Itaru: "When I showed Faris-tan an image of the IBN 5100, she said she donated a similar PC to a shrine ten years ago. Dunno if it’s the one we want, though."
Rintaro: "She donated it... to a shrine?"
UNSPOKEN: That’s an unexpected combination. PCs... and shrines. Consumer electronics... and ancient Shinto rituals. They’re not even tangentially related.
Rintaro: "Which shrine?"
Itaru: "Uh, didn’t ask. My bad."
Rintaro: "Whatever. It’s a lead."
UNSPOKEN: The only shrines in Akiba are Kanda Myojin and Yanabayashi Shrine. I don’t know if Faris was living in Akiba at the time, but at least it’s a start.
Itaru: "Well, I’m hanging up. The Faris Cup is about to begin."
Rintaro: "I see. Daru, I’m sure you can do it. Be sure to win."
Itaru: "Leave it to me!"
UNSPOKEN: What the hell is a Faris Cup anyway? No, more importantly, the shrine. Let’s contact her, not by phone, but by email. I send an email and get a reply in a matter of minutes. That’s it? Call Daru? What does this mean? I guess there’s no choice. I’ll call Daru. Kanda Myojin is the larger and more popular shrine, so nine out of ten people would choose to donate something there. But when I inquire at the shrine office, nobody knows anything about an old computer. That leaves Yanabayashi Shrine. It’s probably not there either, but I have to try. If that fails, I’ll have to search all of Tokyo’s shrines one by one. The thought alone makes me dizzy, so I set it aside for now.
Rintaro: "Who is this?"
UNSPOKEN: What? All I can hear is noise. Wrong number? No, maybe--
Rintaro: "You’re from the Organization, aren’t you? Is this a warning? You telling me to stop getting involved with SERN?"
Kurisu: "Huh?"
UNSPOKEN: Hm? It’s a woman’s voice. And she clearly doesn’t understand what I’m talking about.
Rintaro: "You’re not from the Organization?"
Kurisu: "...No. It’s Makise."
Rintaro: "Makise..."
UNSPOKEN: Who? I think I remember this voice from somewhere...
Rintaro: "Sorry, but I don’t remember. Tell me where we met. Paris? Or London, perh--"
Woman Named Makise: "Akihabara. We saw each other yesterday, remember?"
UNSPOKEN: Yesterday? Makise... Makise...
Rintaro: "Oh! My assistant!"
Kurisu: "Not your assistant! Makise Kurisu!"
Rintaro: "If you don’t say Christina, then I have no way of knowing it’s you."
Kurisu: "I’m not Christina either! How many times do I have to tell you?"
