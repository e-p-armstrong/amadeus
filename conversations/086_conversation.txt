Rintaro: Why do you want her to like meat!?
Mayuri: That's not it! If you keep repeating 'MEAT', then she'll actually start to hate meat and want to eat vegetables instead, don't you think?
Itaru: Yeah... no.
UNSPOKEN: Lukako completes his composition while we speak our nonsense.
Luka: How about something like this? 'MOM EAT VEGGIES OK'
Itaru: Isn't that a little too vague?
Rintaro: And the first 'MOM' should go. That'll just make it harder to believe.
Luka: Then... 'EAT LOTS OF VEGGIES TO GIVE BIRTH TO A GIRL'.
Kurisu: That's a little too direct. And it's over the character limit.
Luka: 'EAT VEGGIES FOR HEALTHY KID'
Itaru: Wait a sec. According to this conversion chart, it looks like you gotta use two more numbers for voiced consonants. So that sentence is four bytes over.
Rintaro: Then a little modification. How about 'EAT VEG 4 HEALTHY KID'?
Kurisu: Isn't that a little too informal? You're talking to Urushibara-san's mother, you know? Would she understand the 'VEG 4' part?
