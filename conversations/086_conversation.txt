Rintaro: Oh, that's boring. So, what is it, assistant?
Kurisu: I said I'm not your assistant. Haah, what's the point... Where are you now?
Rintaro: I'm headed to Yanabayashi Shrine.
Kurisu: Ah, okay. Bye then.
Rintaro: Huh? What!? What was that!? Is she messing with me!? She's messing with me!
UNSPOKEN: How dare my assistant treat me like this!? I shall scold her most harshly the next time we meet. She thinks she's all that just because she was published in a major journal.
Rintaro: Your accomplishments mean nothing to me.
Kurisu: What are you talking about?
UNSPOKEN: When I arrive at Yanabayashi Shrine, I find my assistant waiting there for some reason. She glares at me with her usual frown.
Rintaro: What was that phone call about?
Kurisu: I just wanted to ask you where you were. And since you said you were coming here, I came.
Rintaro: Nobody asked you to come.
Kurisu: And yet, here I am.
UNSPOKEN: Why is she always in such a bad mood?
Rintaro: Why did you come to see me?
Kurisu: Not because I wanted to or anything. Don't get me wrong.
UNSPOKEN: She just keeps those abusive words coming.
Kurisu: ...I can't stop thinking about what you said yesterday.
Rintaro: What I said?
Kurisu: About the IBN 5100. And SERN.
Rintaro: Of course! You're working for SERN, not the Organization! You're here to kill me, aren't you!? That's what I thought! You have the face of a killer!
Kurisu: What's wrong with my face? How rude! Can you calm down a bit? You're always screwing around. I can't believe you're older than me.
Rintaro: Calm down? Hmph! You don't understand what it's like to live on the run, never knowing when the next assassin will strike.
Kurisu: All I'm hearing is gibberish.
Rintaro: You come here to pick a fight?
Kurisu: I just want to know how the IBN 5100 and SERN are related.
Rintaro: Don't you mean you're interested in SERN's time machine research? Be honest with yourself.
Kurisu: Sh-shut up. I'm not interested in time machines at all. More importantly, did you find an IBN 5100?
Rintaro: That's why I'm here.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks up at Yanabayashi Shrine's small archway.
Kurisu: A shrine?
Rintaro: Correct.
UNSPOKEN: Then, with perfect timing, a beautiful girl -- er, boy -- dressed in miko garb appears from the nearby shrine office, holding a bamboo broom.
Luka: Ah, Oka... Kyouma-san, hello.
Rintaro: ...Lukako, why don't you have it?
Luka: Huh? Um, are you talking about Demon Sword Samidare?
Rintaro: I thought I told you to carry it at all times!
Luka: I'm sorry, but, it gets in the way when I'm cleaning, so...
Rintaro: What if they attack while you're cleaning? Nobody's going to come to your rescue, you know.
Luka: Th-that's true... I'll be more careful from now on.
Kurisu: Hey. What are you two talking about?
