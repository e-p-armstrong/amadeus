UNSPOKEN: Tch, what did she come here for?
Luka’s Father: Luka told me his name was Hououin. Hmm, maybe Luka was just playing a trick on me. Hahaha.
Luka: Th-that's not it, Dad. Okabe-san is his real name, and Hououin is, umm...
Rintaro: I am Hououin.
Kurisu: Okabe Rintaro is the name your parents gave you, right? Are you denying that?
Rintaro: Just be quiet, Zombie!
Kurisu: Who's a zombie!?
Luka’s Father: Hahaha. It's great that you all get along.
UNSPOKEN: Luka's dad looks at Kurisu.
Luka’s Father: Are you one of Luka's friends too? Please get along with Luka from now on too.
Kurisu: Um, I'm...
Luka’s Father: As you can see, this child of mine is so delicate.
Luka: C-come on, Dad...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks like she's going to cry for some reason. What's wrong? Is she upset that Luka's father assumes she's a friend? Kurisu notices my stare and quickly turns away.
Luka’s Father: So, Hououin-kun. Did you need me for something?
UNSPOKEN: That's right. This is no time for idle chatter. This meeting will shape the course of Ragnarok! The future of mankind is, well, whatever. I'm a mad scientist, not some sort of hero. I explain to Lukako's father how I need the IBN 5100. And then I ask him if that retro PC was donated to Yanabayashi Shrine. Of course, I don't disclose any classified information, like how we plan to hack SERN or how this is all related to time machine research.
Luka’s Father: I don't know if 'donated' is the right word to use... But an old computer was entrusted to this shrine about nine years ago.
Rintaro: Eh...
UNSPOKEN: No way. Really?
Rintaro: That's it! That has to be it!
