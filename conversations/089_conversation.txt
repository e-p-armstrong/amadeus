Kurisu: What, something wrong with that? I spend all my time doing research.
Rintaro: You're wasting your youth.
Kurisu: I thought so too, until I met you. Now I realize I'm doing just fine.
UNSPOKEN: ...Touche.
Luka: Umm, no fighting please...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako's flustered again.
Rintaro: You're a lifesaver, Lukako. Thank your father again for me.
UNSPOKEN: Luka's dad has already returned to the shrine office. Lukako nods.
Kurisu: Your father is a lovely man.
Luka: Eh...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako and I freeze at my assistant's nonchalant words.
Luka: M-my father is m-married... a-ad-adultery... is bad!
Kurisu: Huh?
Rintaro: I see, assistant. So you like older men.
Kurisu: Hey, wait! Don't misunderstand, you two. That's not what I meant!
Luka: I-I won't give up my father...
Kurisu: P-please don't cry... I just meant I was jealous of how well you get along with your father. That's all.
Luka: Eh, ah, of course... I'm sorry for the weird misunderstanding! That was so rude of me!
Kurisu: Don't cry. We've resolved the misunderstanding, so it's all okay.
Rintaro: ...but in the depths of your heart lie feelings for Luka's dad.
Kurisu: Die.
UNSPOKEN: Christina turns away. I decide to leave it at that. Angering her any further could lead to violence.
Rintaro: Lukako, don't forget your practice swings with Samidare.
Luka: Y-yes sir. I'll do my best... Umm, El Psy Kongalee...
Rintaro: It's Kongroo! Don't forget it.
Luka: I'm sorry!
Kurisu: Hey! What kind of lowlife teases a girl?
UNSPOKEN: I wouldn't know. Lukako is a guy. I ignore Christina and lift up the box with the IBN 5100 inside.
Rintaro: Hng! ...Gah, it's heavy!
UNSPOKEN: I can barely get it off the ground. I put it down for now. Now I know why Luka's dad was red in the face when he brought this thing in.
Luka: Is it that heavy?
Kurisu: Pathetic. It's only as big as a CRT monitor.
Rintaro: Then why don't you try carrying it? Then you'll understand.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu sighs, grabs both ends of the cardboard box, and lifts.
Kurisu: Wheugh...!
UNSPOKEN: She strains with all her might, but gives up without lifting it even a centimeter.
Kurisu: ...It's r-really heavy.
UNSPOKEN: She blushes slightly, but still maintains her usual frown. My assistant seems to have a strong competitive spirit.
Kurisu: This thing's gotta weigh like 30 kilos. Maybe we should've borrowed a push cart. Urushibara-san, is there one in the shrine?
Luka: Umm, there is one, but actually, it's broken... I'm sorry.
Kurisu: Oh. Is there some other place we could borrow--
Rintaro: No, we don't need a push cart.
Kurisu: Then how are you going to bring it back? It takes about ten minutes to walk to your run-down lab from here.
