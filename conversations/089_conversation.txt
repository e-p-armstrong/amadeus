Kurisu: Shut up. Don't talk to me.
UNSPOKEN: Your lips say don't, but your aura says please. Maybe she's begging for attention?
Rintaro: Listen. You don't have to talk. Just listen. If there's something troubling you, I'll do everything in my power to help.
Kurisu: ...Eh?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks at me blankly.
Rintaro: And it's not just me. I'm sure I speak for Mayuri and Daru as well. So don't hesitate to come to us. When you want to cry, don't hold it in. Just let it out. We won't reject you. We'll hear you out.
Kurisu: Why...
Rintaro: Because you're important to us. You're our friend.
Kurisu: Ah... yeah...
UNSPOKEN: For some reason, Kurisu blushes and hangs her head. She hugs Upa so hard, his face caves in.
Kurisu: ...I'm sorry. I was a little upset.
Rintaro: You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. Just tell me when you're ready. I'll hear you out.
Kurisu: ...Okay.
