Kurisu: So that's why... Well, if we carry it together, we might be able to manage, but... But I refuse.
Rintaro: ...huh?
Kurisu: I... I said 'no!'
Rintaro: I'm pretty sure you said 'but I refuse.'
Kurisu: Sh-shut up. I said no.
UNSPOKEN: But I refuse is a famous manga quote. Could Kurisu be an @channeler?
Kurisu: The whole reason you made me a lab mem was to 'borrow my knowledge'. From this, it is elementary to derive the following: 'I won't do physical labor.'
Rintaro: I see. Then I guess I have no choice. I'll do my best to carry it, but...
UNSPOKEN: I glance at Lukako. He twitches when he notices my look, then timidly raises his hand with tears in his eyes.
Luka: Um, th-then, I will...
Kurisu: Eh? You're going to help? Will you be okay?
Luka: Yes, I'll d-do my best.
Rintaro: No, Lukako. I shouldn't make you help me. I can manage by myself.
Luka: But... we're friends, Okabe-san. I want to help you.
Rintaro: No, I'll do it myself.
Luka: I-I'll help you!
Kurisu: Th-then, umm... me too...
Rintaro: Please, go ahead.
Kurisu: Eh? Wha!?
Rintaro: Muhahaha! Don't you know, Christina? This is what you call a Japanese Gag!
Kurisu: You sneaky...
Rintaro: Thanks for the backup, Lukako! Now that that's settled, my assistant will help me carry the computer, so you don't have to help. Thanks for the offer.
Luka: Ah, okay... if that's how it is, then...
Rintaro: Now, assistant! Since you volunteered, I won't let you refuse. Grab hold and heave!
Kurisu: ...Fine.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu and I lift up the cardboard box. The burden's considerably easier when distributed between two people.
Kurisu: Why do we have to be face to face?
UNSPOKEN: We're positioned so that we're looking at each other. But there's no other way to hold it, so what can you do?
Rintaro: Let's just go.
UNSPOKEN: I start to walk out of the shrine.
Kurisu: Hey! Stop stop stop! I said stop!
Rintaro: You're a noisy one.
Kurisu: Don't walk forwards. Then I have to walk backwards. Let's walk sideways.
Rintaro: Whatever. Get moving, assistant.
Kurisu: Hey, listen, please, just listen! I can't walk backwards!
Rintaro: Of course you can. You're my assistant.
Kurisu: I appreciate the vote of confidence, but I can't! I'm asking you to go sideways! No, I'm telling you to go sideways! Sideways! I'm going to fall!
UNSPOKEN: It's dark by the time we get to the lab. It's normally less than a fifteen minute walk, but since Kurisu kept begging to take breaks, it ended up taking twice as long.
Kurisu: Haah, we finally made it... I'm exhausted...
Rintaro: If you didn't complain so much about every little thing, we would've gotten here sooner.
Kurisu: Right back at you. You stopped to take a break at least five times along the way.
Rintaro: That's because I wasn't feeling well...
