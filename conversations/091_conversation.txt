UNSPOKEN: That was fast. And she's glaring at me even harder than she was during the whole underwear thing.
Kurisu: SERN has the best equipment in the world, and even after nine years, they still haven't succeeded. We can't possibly hope to accomplish something like that.
Mayuri: You'll become a GelOkarin! Ehehe!
Itaru: Kinda sounds like Gero Froggy. Why did those things get popular, anyway?
Kurisu: This isn't a laughing matter...
Rintaro: Isn't it too early to give up? Haven't we already succeeded with D-Mail, a first in human history?
Itaru: But we're not the first. Didn't SERN do it before us?
Rintaro: Humanity's first time-traveling email. For we who have achieved that miracle, nothing is impossible!
Kurisu: Such baseless confidence. Anyway, wasn't it just a coincidence that we discovered D-Mail? We still haven't figured out what's functioning as the lifter.
Rintaro: We just need to figure that out, don't we?
Kurisu: It's futile. How do you solve a problem that even SERN can't figure out? If you can't set the destination, then you don't know where you'll leap to.
Itaru: I'll pass on leaping into deep space, thanks.
UNSPOKEN: That is a problem. If you can't control where you'll end up, your time machine is worthless.
Rintaro: Wait a second. We don't set the destination when we send a D-Mail, yet it still arrives where it's supposed to. How do you explain that?
Kurisu: Now that you mention it...
Itaru: You set the mail address, right? Isn't that enough?
Kurisu: Is it? I don't think a phone signal can be received from millions of kilometers away.
Mayuri: I bet you'd get a busy signal or something!
UNSPOKEN: I stare at my phone.
Rintaro: Maybe our cellphones are acting like black holes and white holes.
Kurisu: You shouldn't speculate like that. You have zero basis.
Rintaro: Is it possible that we form a wormhole?
Kurisu: No wormholes have ever been confirmed to exist.
UNSPOKEN: I groan. Kurisu and Daru fall silent. The problem has them stumped too. Mayuri's the only one smiling. She probably doesn't understand and is just smiling because she feels like it.
Rintaro: In any case, the cold, hard truth is that D-Mails arrive precisely when and where we want them to. We're ahead of SERN in that regard. Now, can we apply D-Mail technology to physical time travel?
Itaru: But with D-Mails, you can only send 36 bytes of data. No way you can send a whole person with that kind of limit.
UNSPOKEN: It's the same problem that SERN is having, and the reason their subjects turn into jellymen.
Kurisu: If you want to become GelOkarin, I'm not stopping you.
UNSPOKEN: Recalling the fate of SERN's researchers makes my skin crawl. Kerr black holes. Ring singularities. Super gravitational space-time distortions. If you can adjust the lifter's volume of electron injection, you might be able to make the ring singularities naked. But even SERN is having a hard time controlling the lifter. Even if we do figure out what's functioning as the lifter in our time machine, I doubt we'll be able to solve the problem easily. Meaning that at present, we can only send a mere 36 bytes of data. I wonder how much data there is in a human body. I bet it's more than an exabyte...
Kurisu: It would be best to leave physical transfer aside for now. Sending data through time is an amazing feat by itself. We should be satisfied with what we've got.
UNSPOKEN: Sending data through time is enough, huh?
Rintaro: Such pessimism is unbecoming of a scientist sworn to uncover the secrets of the universe.
Kurisu: I'm telling you to know your limits. If you're going to uncover the secrets of the universe, you need personnel, equipment, and funding to rival SERN's. It's one thing to set lofty goals, but this impoverished lab has no resources to speak of. I've been thinking. Maybe we should bring the PhoneWave to a proper research institution and entrust it to a specialist. SERN's keeping their time machine research top secret, so if we make an official announcement, it'll benefit the future of mankind.
