Rintaro: SERN, and the system that rules the world.
Kurisu: If that's what makes you happy...
Rintaro: Happy? I do not desire happiness. Have you forgotten? I am an insane mad scientist! What I desire is chaos. The time machine exists to bring chaos to the world. MUHAHAHAHA!
Kurisu: Never mind happiness. You're like a junkie hypersecreting beta endorphins.
Mayuri: Okarin? I don't want you doing bad things, remember?
Itaru: But wow! I can't believe you found one. You make the impossible look easy! That's why we love you! That's why we ad--
Kurisu: I certainly don't admire him.
Itaru: ...Eh?
Rintaro: Eh?
Kurisu: Eh...?
UNSPOKEN: For a moment, there is complete silence.
Mayuri: It's all thanks to Mayushii!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri, oblivious as always, puffs out her chest with pride. But I don't miss Kurisu's relieved sigh. She keeps dropping manga quotes. Does this mean what I think it means?
Mayuri: Without Mayushii's info, Okarin would still be lost on the streets of Akiba.
Rintaro: Mayuri's right. She did well this time.
Mayuri: Ehehe! Anyway, it's time for Mayushii to go home. What about you, Chris-chan? Wanna go together?
Kurisu: Thanks. But I'm going to stay here a little longer.
UNSPOKEN: Looks like Kurisu's interested in the IBN 5100 and SERN after all. That reminds me. I haven't filled her in yet.
Mayuri: Okay. But you should go home before it gets too late. See you tomorrow! Tutturuâ™ª
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri waves her hand as she leaves.
Rintaro: Now then, Daru. When do you think we can use the IBN 5100 to hack SERN?
Itaru: Hmm... well...
UNSPOKEN: Daru talks as he plugs the IBN 5100's power adapter into the wall. He turns the machine on, and the power supply begins to make a turbulent noise.
Itaru: Wow, it actually turned on. First I need to learn how to use this thing. It looks like hooking it up is gonna be a pain. It might take a while. I can't play with this thing and search for the server admin's ID at the same time.
Rintaro: Alright. Prioritize the ID search. If possible, I'd like you to get the IBN 5100 ready to use this month, though.
Itaru: There's still 30 days left this month. It's not gonna take that long.
UNSPOKEN: That's my super hacka.
Rintaro: ...?
UNSPOKEN: I don't recognize the number, so I decide to ignore the call. It could be an Organization assassin trying to lure me into a trap.
Rintaro: I'm wise to your tricks, fiend!
UNSPOKEN: I don't bother calling back. When I enter the courtyard, I see a beautiful girl -- er, boy -- in miko robes sweeping with a bamboo broom.
Luka: Ah, Oka... Kyouma-san, hello.
Rintaro: ...Lukako, why don't you have it?
Luka: Huh? Um, are you talking about Demon Sword Samidare?
