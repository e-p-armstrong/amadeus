UNSPOKEN: I don’t bother calling back. When I enter the courtyard, I see a beautiful girl -- er, boy -- in miko robes sweeping with a bamboo broom.
Luka: "Ah, Oka... Kyouma-san, hello."
Rintaro: "...Lukako, why don’t you have it?"
Luka: "Huh? Um, are you talking about Demon Sword Samidare?"
Rintaro: "I thought I told you to carry it at all times!"
Luka: "I’m sorry, but it gets in the way when I’m cleaning..."
Rintaro: "What are you going to do if they attack while you’re cleaning? Nobody’s going to come to your rescue, you know."
Luka: "Th-that’s true... I’ll be more careful from now on."
Rintaro: "By the way, Lukako. I need to talk to your father. Can you go get him?"
Luka: "Yes, I can, but, what do you need to talk to him about?"
Rintaro: "Serious business, critical for the future of mankind."
Luka: "The future... of mankind!? I-I’ll go get him!"
UNSPOKEN: Lukako rushes into the shrine office. He’ll believe just about anything I say. Lukako’s father soon appears. Lukako is pretty flustered. He’s practically dragging his father behind him.
Luka: "Hurry, dad! Hurry!"
Luka’s Father: "Slow down a little. If you rush me, I’m going to fall."
Luka: "But the future of mankind is at stake!"
Luka’s Father: "Oh. Well. That’s certainly serious."
UNSPOKEN: I’ve met Lukako’s father several times before. He’s a gentle, respectable adult. With the exception of how he raised Lukako. Apparently, the reason Lukako wears miko garb is because his father requested it. Maybe his dad’s a pervert. No, it’s not like I mean to mock the Shinto priesthood or anything like that.
Luka’s Father: "Ah, Hououin-kun. It’s been a while. Thank you for always taking care of Luka."
Rintaro: "The honor is mine."
Luka’s Father: "Did you need me for something?"
Luka: "Th-that’s right...! The future of mankind...!"
Luka’s Father: "That sounds serious."
UNSPOKEN: Luka’s father deflects his son’s panic with a gentle smile. Impressive. He knows how to brush someone off without making them feel bad. Maybe I should take notes. Anyway. I explain to Lukako’s father about how I need an IBN 5100. I ask him if there’s one at the shrine. Of course, I don’t disclose any classified information, like how we plan to hack SERN or how this is all related to time machine research.
Luka’s Father: "I don’t know if ’donated’ is the right word to use... But an old computer was entrusted to this shrine about nine years ago."
Rintaro: "Eh..."
UNSPOKEN: No way. Really?
Rintaro: "That’s it! That has to be it!"
