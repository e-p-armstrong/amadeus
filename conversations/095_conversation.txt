UNSPOKEN: Fortunately, the lab is less than a 15 minute walk from here.
Luka: "It looks pretty heavy..."
Rintaro: "Hmph. No matter how heavy it may look, it’s still just a computer. I can manage."
UNSPOKEN: I try lifting up the cardboard box with the IBN 5100 inside.
Rintaro: "Huff! ...Gah, it’s heavy!"
UNSPOKEN: It’ll take everything I’ve got to carry this all the way. I put it down for now. Now I know why Lukako’s father was red in the face when he carried this thing.
Luka: "A-are you okay?"
Rintaro: "Kuh... why now!?"
UNSPOKEN: I grab my right wrist.
Rintaro: "My right hand... is aching!"
Luka: "B-but, that means...! Umm, umm, I-I’ll perform an exorcism!"
UNSPOKEN: Lukako turns to go get his miko tools, but I grab his hand to stop him.
Rintaro: "Wait... d-don’t go... I’m still okay..."
Luka: "B-but Kyouma-san, you look like you’re in pain! Wh-what should I do..."
Rintaro: "It’s okay... it’ll stop soon... you don’t need to worry... But... I have a request. Will you hear me out?"
Luka: "Y-yes, if it’s something I can do!"
Rintaro: "Please help me... carry this box."
Luka: "Eh..."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako’s eyes quickly fill with tears.
Luka: "B-but I’m not strong at all..."
Rintaro: "We can manage... together. You’re the only one I can depend on now."
Luka: "Kyouma-san..."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako gazes straight into my eyes, then looks away apologetically.
Luka: "I don’t know if I can do it..."
Rintaro: "You can do it. I know you can."
Luka: "...Okay. But, um, if we can take breaks along the way, I’d be happy..."
UNSPOKEN: That settles it. I grab one side of the cardboard box.
Rintaro: "Alright, Lukako, grab the other side."
Luka: "Um... is your arm... okay now?"
Rintaro: "No. We can’t let our guard down. This might only be temporary. We need to get this to the lab before I have a relapse."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako makes a mad dash to the cardboard box.
Luka: "I’ll do my best! But I’m not confident..."
Rintaro: "Don’t worry. I’ll support you."
UNSPOKEN: With that said, we lift up the box on the count of three. It’s easier than carrying it alone, but it’s still heavy. It sure is going to be hard to carry this for 15 minutes.
Luka: "Ugh! I-it’s heavy!"
Rintaro: "Brace your legs! Let’s keep going. We’ll move sideways, okay? Don’t move forwards or backwards!"
Luka: "Kayyy... Um, sideways, as in left? Right!?"
Rintaro: "Right... no, my right, so your left... go left!"
Luka: "Okaayyyyy... B-but, my hand, my hand is cramping..."
UNSPOKEN: Tch, he’s giving in faster than expected! We haven’t even left the shrine!
Rintaro: "Fight, Lukako! And whatever you do, don’t drop it! We’re screwed if it breaks!"
