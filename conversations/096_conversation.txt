UNSPOKEN: This is going to be tough. It’s dark by the time we get to the lab. It’s normally less than a fifteen minute walk, but since we had to stop a few times to let Lukako rest, it ended up taking twice as long.
Luka: "Haah... haah... we made it..."
Rintaro: "Yeah... thanks for the help... you’re... a lifesaver... Phew, really... thanks..."
Luka: "Ah, no..."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako starts fidgeting.
Luka: "Since you’re my master, Kyouma-san, I’m happy... to be of use to you."
UNSPOKEN: He doesn’t wipe the sweat off his brow. But despite that, Lukako turns to me with a brave smile as he speaks. So cute... But he’s a guy. It’s so disappointing! I look up to the second floor to see the lights turned on. Let’s get the IBN 5100 into the lab. The final barrier awaits. We have to ascend this rickety building’s narrow staircase. That’s surely impossible for just Lukako and me. Might as well call for help.
Rintaro: "Come forth, my servants! By the covenant I command thee, grant me thy power!"
Luka: "K-Kyouma-san!?"
UNSPOKEN: The second story window opens when I cry out. The face that appears is--
Kurisu: "You’re so annoying! What is it!?"
Rintaro: "Huh, I summoned an assistant. What are you doing here?"
Kurisu: "Who’re you calling an assistant? You wouldn’t pick up your phone, so I’ve been waiting here an hour for you."
UNSPOKEN: My phone? That reminds me. Before I went to Yanabayashi Shrine, I got a call from an unknown number. So that was her?
Mayuri: "Hi, Okarin! Huh? Luka-kun’s with you!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri appears behind my assistant. Lukako waves to Mayuri. At the same time, the door to the Braun Tube Workshop opens.
Suzuha: "Hey, Okabe Rintaro. The boss says to quiet down. You’re disturbing the neighbors."
UNSPOKEN: Part-Time Warrior appears. Well, that’s plenty of help. It’s disappointing that they’re all girls, but I’ll compromise for quantity over quality.
Rintaro: "Assemble, servants! We have a mission of the utmost secrecy! Come!"
UNSPOKEN: Obeying my command, Mayuri, my assistant, and Part-Time Warrior all walk over to me.
Mayuri: "What’s this?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri peeks inside the cardboard box with great interest.
Suzuha: "Wait... you got one?"
Rintaro: "Indeed I did."
Suzuha: "No way! Amazing! Way to go, Okabe Rintaro! Where did you find it?"
Rintaro: "Yanabayashi Shrine."
Suzuha: "Yanbayashi Shrine? You mean, like a Shinto shrine?"
Rintaro: "Yeah."
Suzuha: "What was it doing there..."
UNSPOKEN: The warrior looks confused for some reason.
Mayuri: "Oh! So that’s why Luka-kun’s with you."
Luka: "Y-yeah..."
Kurisu: "What’s this? What’re you talking about?"
