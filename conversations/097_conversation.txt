Rintaro: "I got an IBN 5100."
Kurisu: "Oh, that thing you were talking about yesterday."
Suzuha: "Ah...!"
UNSPOKEN: For some reason, Suzuha gasps when she sees my assistant. And then, she approaches until they’re close enough to feel each other’s breath.
Kurisu: "Y-yes?"
Suzuha: "Makise Kurisu?"
Kurisu: "Yes...?"
UNSPOKEN: For some reason, she stares at Kurisu with frightful intensity. Kurisu narrows her eyes and meets Suzuha’s stare. Wh-what’s going on here? I can’t move a muscle, the air’s so thick with tension.
Kurisu: "What is it? Have I done something to you?"
Suzuha: "...Hmph."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha turns away, and without looking back, disappears into the Braun Tube Workshop.
Kurisu: "Who was that?"
Mayuri: "Oh, she works part-time at the Braun Tube Workshop. Her name’s Suzu-san!"
Rintaro: "I know."
UNSPOKEN: I don’t know about the Suzu-san part, though.
Mayuri: "You do?"
Kurisu: "Why was she glaring at me like that?"
Rintaro: "How should I know? Did you do something to make her angry?"
Kurisu: "I’ve never seen her before in my life. How rude."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu picked a fight with me the first time we met too. But that was a hallucination, so I don’t say anything.
Rintaro: "Anyway, help me out here. We’re taking this thing into the lab."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha’s departure decreases the number of helpers, but the four of us should be enough. By the time we wrestle the IBN 5100 into the lab, every one of us is out of breath. Daru’s at his computer eating potato chips.
Rintaro: "Hey! Why didn’t you help!?"
Itaru: "Well, you didn’t call me."
Rintaro: "I said all members assemble, didn’t I!?"
UNSPOKEN: Since Daru didn’t come, the three girls -- err, two girls and one crossdressing boy -- are all worn out. Mayuri and Lukako are clearly not cut out for physical labor, and Kurisu did nothing but complain.
Kurisu: "Haah, haah... why do I... have to..."
Mayuri: "So tired..."
Luka: "I can’t walk any more..."
Rintaro: "Good work, you three."
UNSPOKEN: I pick three bananas from the bunch on the table and distribute them among the three worn-out girls.
Rintaro: "This is my thanks for helping. Eat up."
Luka: "Thank you! I’m so happy!"
Mayuri: "But those are Mayushii’s bananas..."
Rintaro: "That reminds me, Mayuri. It’s thanks to you that I got this IBN 5100. If it weren’t for your information, it would’ve taken forever to find it."
Mayuri: "Ehehe! Really? I’m glad I was useful."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri happily takes a bite of her banana.
Kurisu: "What are you going to use the IBN 5100 for? Yesterday you said something about SERN."
Rintaro: "You interested, Christina?"
Kurisu: "I’m not Christina, and I’m not interested. If you don’t want to tell me, then I don’t really care."
