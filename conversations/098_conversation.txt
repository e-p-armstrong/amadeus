UNSPOKEN: Well, whatever. Back to checking mail. But I'm thirsty from this hard day's work. So before that, I take a fresh Dr P out of the fridge.
Kurisu: Hey, aren't you going to tell me what's going on?
UNSPOKEN: I toss the bottle to Kurisu once she turns around.
Kurisu: Kya!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu tries to catch it, but fails magnificently. She picks the bottle up off the floor, then shoots me a glare.
Rintaro: I'll explain in a second. Drink that while you wait.
Kurisu: ...Gee, thanks.
UNSPOKEN: I need to send a reply to Shining Finger. She ended up being no help at all, but I suppose I can't just say nothing. I got the goods. Over. I send as concise a message as possible.
Rintaro: Now then...
UNSPOKEN: I turn back to Kurisu, but the reply comes before I can open my mouth. Turnaround in less than five seconds. She must have her phone in hand 24/7. That's the only possible explanation. Gimme? What nonsense is this? Sorry, but I'm not the owner. I can't just give it to you. I send that. Another instant reply. Guh... It's easy to imagine what will happen if I lend it to her. She'll disappear, and I'll never see the IBN 5100 again. No borrowing either. You can come over to our lab if you want to see it, but no touching. I add the lab's address and send the mail. No more replies come.
Rintaro: Sorry for the wait, Christina.
UNSPOKEN: I look up and see Kurisu drinking the Dr P.
Rintaro: Oh? You're a fan of the Doc, I see.
Kurisu: I've lived seven years at its birthplace, after all.
Rintaro: Excellent. We'll make great drinking buddies.
Kurisu: I'm a minor.
Rintaro: That's not what I meant. I meant Dr P drinking buddies.
Kurisu: Is that all you drink?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu shrugs her shoulders and takes another swig, signaling me to talk. And so, I explain how Daru and I hacked into SERN. And how they've already had the LHC in operation for nine years. And how they've successfully created mini black holes. And how it looks like they're researching time travel. And also how they haven't disclosed any of that to the world. Kurisu's expression grows more and more intense as she listens to the story.
Kurisu: SERN certainly is acting strange... but how's the IBN 5100 involved?
Rintaro: SERN's database uses an IBN 5100.
Kurisu: So?
Rintaro: Allow me to explain. My trusted Super Hacka, Mister Daru--
Itaru: It's not super hacka. How many times do I have to tell you?
Rintaro: Super Hacker Mister Daru, has hacked into SERN.
Kurisu: Is that okay? Won't they catch you?
Itaru: I wouldn't make a blunder like that.
Kurisu: That's not what I meant.
Rintaro: As a result, we found evidence that those bastards are researching time travel with the LHC.
Kurisu: The LHC?
Itaru: Seriously. We have the evidence. And guess what? The LHC has been in operation for nine years.
