Kurisu: "!!"
Rintaro: "I am not Okabe! I am HOUOUIN KYOUMA! How many times do I have to tell you, Christina!?"
Kurisu: "...God, you’re so full of yourself."
Rintaro: "From now on, call me Hououin. That or Kyouma."
Kurisu: "No."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu snaps at me and turns away. Are those tears I see in her eyes?
Rintaro: "Are you... crying?"
Kurisu: "I’m not crying! It’s not like I was scared of you for a second there or anything, and I definitely wasn’t relieved when you started talking like an idiot again, okay!?"
UNSPOKEN: She stalks over to the window and stares outside. I see her wipe her eyes with the back of her hand. Seems she was crying after all.
Rintaro: "Daru, why is my assistant crying?"
Itaru: "Uh, she said so herself just now."
Rintaro: "All I did was correct her on my name."
Itaru: "Maybe she only acts strong but is actually weak on the inside. That would be pretty moe."
UNSPOKEN: Well, whatever. Back to checking mail. But I’m thirsty from this hard day’s work. So before that, I take a fresh Dr P out of the fridge.
Kurisu: "Hey, aren’t you going to tell me what’s going on?"
UNSPOKEN: I toss the bottle to Kurisu once she turns around.
Kurisu: "Kya!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu tries to catch it, but fails magnificently. She picks the bottle up off the floor, then shoots me a glare.
Rintaro: "I’ll explain in a second. Drink that while you wait."
Kurisu: "...Gee, thanks."
UNSPOKEN: I need to send a reply to Shining Finger. She ended up being no help at all, but I suppose I can’t just say nothing. I got the goods. Over. I send as concise a message as possible.
Rintaro: "Now then..."
UNSPOKEN: I turn back to Kurisu, but the reply comes before I can open my mouth. Turnaround in less than five seconds. She must have her phone in hand 24/7. That’s the only possible explanation. Gimme? What nonsense is this? Sorry, but I’m not the owner. I can’t just give it to you. I send that. Another instant reply. Guh... It’s easy to imagine what will happen if I lend it to her. She’ll disappear, and I’ll never see the IBN 5100 again. No borrowing either. You can come over to our lab if you want to see it, but no touching. I add the lab’s address and send the mail. No more replies come.
Rintaro: "Sorry for the wait, Christina."
UNSPOKEN: I look up and see Kurisu drinking the Dr P.
Rintaro: "Oh? You’re a fan of the Doc, I see."
Kurisu: "I’ve lived seven years at its birthplace, after all."
Rintaro: "Excellent. We’ll make great drinking buddies."
Kurisu: "I’m a minor."
Rintaro: "That’s not what I meant. I meant Dr P drinking buddies."
Kurisu: "Is that all you drink?"
