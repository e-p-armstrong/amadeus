Rintaro: "SERN’s database uses an IBN 5100."
Kurisu: "So?"
Rintaro: "Allow me to explain. My trusted Super Hacka, Mister Daru--"
Itaru: "It’s not super hacka. How many times do I have to tell you?"
Rintaro: "Super Hacker Mister Daru, has hacked into SERN."
Kurisu: "Is that okay? Won’t they catch you?"
Itaru: "I wouldn’t make a blunder like that."
Kurisu: "That’s not what I meant."
Rintaro: "As a result, we found evidence that those bastards are researching time travel with the LHC."
Kurisu: "The LHC?"
Itaru: "Seriously. We have the evidence. And guess what? The LHC has been in operation for nine years."
Kurisu: "What? Really!?"
Rintaro: "And they’ve successfully generated mini black holes."
Kurisu: "No way... Then why haven’t they made an official announcement!?"
Rintaro: "That’s just it. For some reason, those bastards won’t announce any of it. That the LHC has been operating for nine years. That they’ve successfully created mini black holes. That they’re researching time travel. Basically, it’s proof that SERN has--"
UNSPOKEN: Dammit. Another email. I’ll start over.
Rintaro: "Basically, it’s proof that SERN has something to hide. Can’t you just smell the conspiracy?"
Kurisu: "I don’t believe in conspiracies, but... If you can prove what you said is real, then I might be surprised. SERN doing time travel research... Ah, but what about the IBN 5100? How is that involved?"
Rintaro: "SERN’s database uses--"
UNSPOKEN: Another email. There’s only one person who can send them this fast. That mail demon! Didn’t I tell her to give it a rest!?
Rintaro: "Sorry. Daru, please continue the explanation."
UNSPOKEN: I excuse myself and open the email. It’s a reply to my earlier email. She’s so impatient. Kurisu is glaring at me. Better make the reply brief. I got an IBN 5100. I can’t lend it to you, but if you want to see it, you can come to our lab. I send the email after adding the lab’s address, and close my phone.
Rintaro: "So, how far did you get?"
Itaru: "Up to the point where SERN’s using IBN 5100 code for their database."
Rintaro: "So basically, what that means is-- The only way to decrypt that database is to use an IBN 5100 of our own."
Kurisu: "How do you know that?"
Rintaro: "I have my sources."
UNSPOKEN: I don’t drop Titor’s name. I have no doubt this genius girl would laugh if I did. Kurisu puts a finger to her lip, deep in thought.
Kurisu: "Setting the IBN 5100 and such aside... I want to see proof that SERN’s really doing that sort of research."
UNSPOKEN: True, we didn’t get any definite proof of SERN’s time travel research last time we hacked them.
Rintaro: "Daru. Will it take much longer to find the server admin’s account?"
Itaru: "Actually, I was just thinking about doing that. It shouldn’t take more than half a day, I guess."
