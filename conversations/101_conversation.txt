Kurisu: "...I’ll wait until then."
Itaru: "You’ll wait? It’s already getting dark. Why not go home for tonight and come back tomorrow morning?"
Kurisu: "No thanks. I’ll wait. I want to know as soon as possible, even if it’s just a microsecond sooner."
Rintaro: "Heh heh heh, that’s the spirit. You’re already fascinated by the conspiracy. You can’t help but want to know what lies at the heart of SERN."
Kurisu: "If what you guys are saying is true... then this isn’t something to joke about. SERN is the world’s top research institution. If they’re doing secret experiments without publishing their results... They’re making fools of scientists the world over. That’s only if it’s true, though."
UNSPOKEN: She finishes by emphasizing that point again. Doesn’t look like she believes us.
Rintaro: "Anyway, Daru. I’ll leave it to you."
UNSPOKEN: According to Daru’s research, the IBN 5100 weighs 25 kilos. For now, we’ll leave it on the shelf in the development room. We carry the cardboard box to the room, half dragging it. Kurisu follows.
Kurisu: "Can you show me the PhoneWave?"
Rintaro: "Indeed I can. Want to experiment?"
Kurisu: "You haven’t been able to send another email to the past yet, right? Do you know why?"
UNSPOKEN: I can only shake my head.
Kurisu: "Let’s run some tests."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks around the development room.
Kurisu: "Man. You have a ton of junk."
Rintaro: "It’s not junk! Since you’re new to the Future Gadget Laboratory, I’ll explain. These are the glorious fruits of our science: the Future Gadgets! Future Gadgets 1-7 are stored here. The PhoneWave, with which you are already familiar, is Gadget Number 8."
Kurisu: "Future Gadgets, huh..."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu casually picks Future Gadget 4: Moad Snake up from the shelf and stares at it.
Kurisu: "Hey. Isn’t this... a weapon?"
Rintaro: "Future Gadget No. 4: Moad Snake, designed after a claymore landmine, is an instant humidifier."
Kurisu: "How confusing."
Rintaro: "Insert water and turn the power on, and in mere seconds, it generates a thick cloud of steam."
Kurisu: "So it’s junk. I thought so."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu sighs and returns Moad Snake to the shelf.
Kurisu: "I’m borrowing this."
UNSPOKEN: Without waiting for a reply, she grabs Daru’s never-worn lab coat from the shelf and puts it on gallantly.
Rintaro: "Whoa!"
Kurisu: "It’s just not right without a lab coat."
UNSPOKEN: Overcome with emotion, I seize Kurisu’s hand and grasp it firmly.
Kurisu: "Hey!"
Rintaro: "Assistant! You get it, don’t you!?"
Kurisu: "G-get what? Let go!"
Rintaro: "If you’re gonna do science, you need a lab coat! Right!?"
