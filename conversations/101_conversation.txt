Rintaro: So I can use your grief to power my time machine. Heh heh heh!
Suzuha: Ahaha! You really are a mad scientist. So eeeevil! If I meet my father, I'll stop by. Then we can do a gun salute!
UNSPOKEN: She laughs happily. Then she starts pedaling...
Rintaro: Hey, wait! Let me on! Hey!
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha doesn't wait, leaving me with no choice but to run back to the lab.
Rintaro: I shall now brief you on Operation Eldhrimnir.
UNSPOKEN: The only lab mems here today are Mayuri, Kurisu, and Lukako. I couldn't get ahold of Faris or Moeka. They must be busy. Daru, meanwhile, gave me some crap about having things to do. I was prepared for Lukako to refuse my invitation, but since she's here, I guess she's forgiven me -- for now, at least.
Rintaro: I want you guys to get ready for a party.
UNSPOKEN: I've already explained to the lab mems what Suzuha told me yesterday.
Kurisu: And what are you going to do?
Rintaro: Me? I'm going to follow that Part-Time Warrior and report back as the situation changes.
Kurisu: Don't you dare. Let her be alone with her father.
Rintaro: Heh heh heh. You shouldn't be so quick to reject my plans, Christina. You don't understand the intricacies of the human psyche. Now that you've rejected my plan, there's no way I'm not going through with it! You have underestimated my pride!
Kurisu: Get over yourself.
Rintaro: Besides, Christina, you and she are enemies, are you not? You protect her from me while plotting her demise? That makes you a hypocrite!
Kurisu: You just don't have standards, that's all.
Mayuri: She's right. I don't think you should bother her, Okarin.
UNSPOKEN: Even during the strategy meeting, Mayuri keeps working on her costume. Lukako hasn't agreed to wear it yet, but Mayuri's enthusiasm remains strong.
Mayuri: No matter what happens, we need to give her a waaaarm welcome. I'll do anything to help make this party super special.
Luka: Um, actually, I haven't met this Suzuha-san...
Mayuri: Suzu-san's really nice. I'm sure you'll get along with her too!
Kurisu: Nice?
Rintaro: Anyway, I'm going to tail her now. You guys--
Kurisu: No! Get it through your thick skull!
Rintaro: Dammit, assistant! How dare you give me orders!?
UNSPOKEN: In the end, I can't get permission to tail Suzuha.
Kurisu: Don't even think about running off somewhere.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu is forcing me to help her with the shopping. There's no way out. Dammit... Kurisu really is turning into a class president character. At this rate, she might take over the lab. Wait. Could this be what Suzuha was warning me about? ...Nah.
Kurisu: Anyway...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu scratches her cheek in what could be taken for a bashful gesture.
Kurisu: I hope Amane-san finds her father.
Rintaro: Yeah.
Kurisu: That would be... nice.
UNSPOKEN: Come to think of it, she has father issues too, doesn't she? Maybe she sympathizes with Suzuha.
Kurisu: Hey, Okabe...
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Kurisu starts fidgeting for some reason.
Kurisu: I'm sorry about before.
Rintaro: Before?
Kurisu: When I hit you with my book. I thought you were just being a pervert. But when I thought about it later, I realized that you were being completely serious. But I acted on impulse, without even considering what you had to say.
Rintaro: Forget it. Regardless of my intentions, the fact of the matter is that I made Lukako cry.
Kurisu: Just to make sure, you're not a perverted scumbag, are you?
Rintaro: Make sure, my ass! Are you trying to apologize or what!?
Kurisu: I just don't want to you to use science as an excuse to be a pervert. Not while I'm helping, at least.
