Kurisu: No need.
Rintaro: What? Do your parents let you do whatever you want?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu turns to me and sighs.
Kurisu: I haven't seen my father in seven years. My mother is in America. I'm living in a hotel right now. Understand?
Rintaro: Wha...!
UNSPOKEN: Living in a hotel? Well, true, renting an apartment for just a month is absurd, but--
Rintaro: You damn celebrity! If you're American, then you should at least use a motel instead of a hotel, right!?
Kurisu: I'm not American, and there aren't any motels in the heart of Tokyo.
Rintaro: What sort of hotel?
Kurisu: What do you mean? It's a normal hotel in Ochanomizu.
Rintaro: Ochanomizu? Then you can walk there from here, can't you?
Kurisu: Sure.
UNSPOKEN: I see. That's why she's so flexible with her schedule. I finally understand.
Rintaro: So, tell me about your father.
Kurisu: Sorry?
Rintaro: You said you haven't seen him in seven years?
Kurisu: Why do you care about my father?
Rintaro: You're the one who mentioned him. Isn't that basically a hidden message saying 'please give me some advice about my father, please'?
Kurisu: You're crazy.
Rintaro: You are my assistant! And I can't let my assistant have any worries. So tell me everything that's on your mind!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu pouts and says no more. Instead, she glares at the circuit box on the wall.
Rintaro: What's wrong?
Kurisu: I have nothing to say to you.
Rintaro: Oh, I know! Your father was a hero, but then he fell to evil and now he wears a black mask and cape and goes 'heeeee koohhh', right!? And in the future, you two are destined to fight and--
UNSPOKEN: I think I heard Kurisu's teeth grind.
Rintaro: ...Y-you're really mad at me, aren't you?
Kurisu: Don't make fun...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu doesn't look me in the eye, but her low voice tells me how mad she is.
Kurisu: Of people's family issues like that. You're trampling on my heart.
UNSPOKEN: Could her father situation be a landmine? Maybe I should apologize. I try to think of the words, but before I can say anything--
Itaru: Hell yeahhhhhhh!
UNSPOKEN: Daru's war cry echoes through the lab.
Rintaro: Did you get it!?
Itaru: Mission complete.
UNSPOKEN: Daru shows his white teeth in a wide grin as he gives a thumbs up.
Itaru: I got the server admin's ID and password. Now we can peep as much as we want, hyahoohh!
Rintaro: And the IBN 5100 database?
Itaru: That's separate, duh. The server admin's unrelated. I mean, it's a database with normally unreadable code, so there's a limit on who can access it. Doesn't look like even the lab director can access it.
Rintaro: There are positions higher than that?
Itaru: There's something called the SERN Executive Council.
Rintaro: Hmm... So they call it a council, eh?
Itaru: What about it?
Rintaro: It's a fitting name for our enemy!
