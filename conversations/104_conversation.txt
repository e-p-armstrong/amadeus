UNSPOKEN: She seems in the mood to eat.
Kurisu: "Also... do you have a fork?"
UNSPOKEN: It’s past midnight. At 8 o’clock, the two of us silently ate cup noodles and warm bananas -- Daru said he didn’t want any -- and ever since then, we’ve been examining the PhoneWave (name subject to change). I’ve mainly focused on the terminal mode settings through the X68000. The programs Daru wrote are all Wizard-class though, so I can’t understand most of them. Kurisu’s been examining the AC adapter and the lab’s electrical switchboard for a while. Though we stopped her when she tried to disassemble them. It’s early morning, and she still shows no sign of leaving. Where is she staying anyway? She’s been in Japan for one or two months, and she did say she was going back to America this month. The trains aren’t running this late, so I guess she might not be able to leave even if she wants to. But in that case, why didn’t she leave before the trains stopped? Don’t tell me she plans to stay!? No girls have ever stayed over at the lab. Mayuri has a curfew, so she always goes back home to Ikebukuro. Daru and I frequently stay here, though. It’s not an exaggeration to say we live here half the time. Maybe it’s normal for American girls to stay overnight in labs.
Rintaro: "Christina, is it okay to stay here this late? Perhaps you should contact your family."
Kurisu: "No need."
Rintaro: "What? Do your parents let you do whatever you want?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu turns to me and sighs.
Kurisu: "I haven’t seen my father in seven years. My mother is in America. I’m living in a hotel right now. Understand?"
Rintaro: "Wha...!"
UNSPOKEN: Living in a hotel? Well, true, renting an apartment for just a month is absurd, but--
Rintaro: "You damn celebrity! If you’re American, then you should at least use a motel instead of a hotel, right!?"
Kurisu: "I’m not American, and there aren’t any motels in the heart of Tokyo."
Rintaro: "What sort of hotel?"
Kurisu: "What do you mean? It’s a normal hotel in Ochanomizu."
Rintaro: "Ochanomizu? Then you can walk there from here, can’t you?"
Kurisu: "Sure."
UNSPOKEN: I see. That’s why she’s so flexible with her schedule. I finally understand.
Rintaro: "So, tell me about your father."
Kurisu: "Sorry?"
Rintaro: "You said you haven’t seen him in seven years?"
Kurisu: "Why do you care about my father?"
Rintaro: "You’re the one who mentioned him. Isn’t that basically a hidden message saying ’please give me some advice about my father, please’?"
Kurisu: "You’re crazy."
Rintaro: "You are my assistant! And I can’t let my assistant have any worries. So tell me everything that’s on your mind!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu pouts and says no more. Instead, she glares at the circuit box on the wall.
Rintaro: "What’s wrong?"
Kurisu: "I have nothing to say to you."
