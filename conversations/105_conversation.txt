UNSPOKEN: I think I heard Kurisu’s teeth grind.
Rintaro: "...Y-you’re really mad at me, aren’t you?"
Kurisu: "Don’t make fun..."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu doesn’t look me in the eye, but her low voice tells me how mad she is.
Kurisu: "Of people’s family issues like that. You’re trampling on my heart."
UNSPOKEN: Could her father situation be a landmine? Maybe I should apologize. I try to think of the words, but before I can say anything--
Itaru: "Hell yeahhhhhhh!"
UNSPOKEN: Daru’s war cry echoes through the lab.
Rintaro: "Did you get it!?"
Itaru: "Mission complete."
UNSPOKEN: Daru shows his white teeth in a wide grin as he gives a thumbs up.
Itaru: "I got the server admin’s ID and password. Now we can peep as much as we want, hyahoohh!"
Rintaro: "And the IBN 5100 database?"
Itaru: "That’s separate, duh. The server admin’s unrelated. I mean, it’s a database with normally unreadable code, so there’s a limit on who can access it. Doesn’t look like even the lab director can access it."
Rintaro: "There are positions higher than that?"
Itaru: "There’s something called the SERN Executive Council."
Rintaro: "Hmm... So they call it a council, eh?"
Itaru: "What about it?"
Rintaro: "It’s a fitting name for our enemy!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks at me coldly. Whatever. Let’s leave the IBN 5100 database for another day.
Rintaro: "Run a search for data on time travel research."
Itaru: "Okey-dokey. That Z Program we saw last time was suspicious, wasn’t it?"
Rintaro: "That, and the Jellyman’s Report."
UNSPOKEN: We couldn’t get concrete information on either before. Kurisu stares holes into the monitor. Her angry expression has disappeared.
Rintaro: "Look carefully. And burn it into your eyes. The proof of SERN’s actions, its deceit upon the world."
Itaru: "Oh yeah, baby. Found the LHC project supervisor."
Rintaro: "The supervisor... that’s a pretty important post."
Itaru: "Right now, we’re peeking inside his computer. Z Program, Z Program... hmm..."
Rintaro: "Z obviously stands for jelly (zerii)!"
Kurisu: "Jelly starts with J. J-E-L-L-Y."
Itaru: "Pfft, careless mistake. So uncool."
Rintaro: "Ahem! What I meant to say is that there’s no way it would have such a simple name. The name’s hiding something important. There has to be a double meaning!"
UNSPOKEN: Daru, who’s been searching through the log, suddenly stops.
Itaru: "Got it!"
UNSPOKEN: He displays a graphic on the monitor. It looks like a scan of a very old paper document. The letterhead reads Z PROGRAM: TOP SECRET.
Itaru: "The program began... in 1973."
Rintaro: "When was SERN formed?"
Kurisu: "1954."
UNSPOKEN: I asked Daru, but Kurisu answers instead, her tone flat. I thought that maybe SERN was formed with the Z Program in mind, but ’54 means my guess was off.
Rintaro: "When was the IBN 5100 put on market?"
