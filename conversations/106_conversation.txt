UNSPOKEN: So maybe that’s why the IBN 5100 was central to SERN’s operations. The years match, after all. It can’t be something as stupidly simple as that. There has to be a worldwide conspiracy involved. Maybe IBN hid their proprietary programming language in the IBN 5100 for the sole purpose of its use in SERN’s Z Program. IBN and SERN are co-conspirators. And both of them are being manipulated from the shadows by an even larger organization. Yeah, that’s way more interesting.
Itaru: "Ugh, a JPEG? Come on! I can’t copypaste this."
UNSPOKEN: Daru mutters some complaint.
Kurisu: "Hmmm, the text isn’t in French..."
UNSPOKEN: What’s on-screen right now looks like English.
Itaru: "Actually, there’s French, Dutch, and German versions too. The content looks the same, though."
Kurisu: "...’SERN’s purpose heading into the 21st Century shall be to establish control over space and time, thereby to enable the destruction of extant history and the creation of an everlasting Utopia, ruled by the Committee, that encompasses the entirety of past and future events.’"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu suddenly starts speaking at a stilted clip.
Itaru: "Oh, right! Makise-shi can do English!"
Rintaro: "Way to go, assistant! Your study abroad in America was all for the sake of today, wasn’t it!?"
Kurisu: "Of course not. Stop assigning people roles in your fantasy world."
UNSPOKEN: Daru relinquishes his chair, allowing Kurisu to sit in front of the computer.
Kurisu: "’In order to maintain this project’s secrecy, and to allow its name to remain relevant in changing circumstances, we designate it the Z Program.’ ’Z, like the Greek Omega or the Cyrillic Ya.’ ’It is forbidden to assign any meaning to this name or to seek in it significance beyond the project itself. Negative returns are predicted should this edict be violated.’ ’The Z Program is a top secret project spanning international borders. Like electromagnetic wave research, it has been approved for top priority funding by the Committee of 300.’ ’Henceforth, all other research performed by SERN shall function to keep the Z Program’s existence secret.’"
UNSPOKEN: I guess Kurisu’s reading the preface to a document. It’s getting rather dull.
Rintaro: "Is there anything specific about what exactly the Z Program is?"
UNSPOKEN: Daru types on the keyboard from the side, bringing up another window.
Kurisu: "Hmm... ah... here. This... can’t be!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu bends forward and stares wide-eyed at the words on the screen.
Rintaro: "What is it?"
Kurisu: "’The purpose of the Z Program is to perform time-space displacement experiments by means of high-energy proton-proton collisions.’"
UNSPOKEN: Time-space displacement experiments.
Rintaro: "Time travel!"
UNSPOKEN: I have to struggle to keep from shouting. I quickly run over to the window and close it. It might make it hotter inside, but it would be worse if people outside overheard us.
Kurisu: "No way... it was true? You’re telling me they’ve been deceiving the world for nearly 40 years?"
