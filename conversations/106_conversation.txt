Kurisu: Umm... 'Stage 1: Construction and implementation of the Large Hadron Collider.' 'Over the past half century, beginning with the Proton Synchrotron completed in 1959, particle accelerator technology has reached the point where standardized results may be obtained.' 'Stage 2: Implementation and testing of lifter technology.' 'The formation of more than two artificial localized singularities, as well as the formation of Kerr black holes, will become possible when this stage is complete.' 'In order to hide the program's true goal, it is necessary to intentionally leak misinformation regarding the formation of black holes.' 'Stage 3: Animal experimentation.' 'Stage 4...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu stops talking. She takes a deep breath, then finally mutters angrily.
Kurisu: ...Human experimentation.
Itaru: ...For real?
UNSPOKEN: A chill runs up my spine. I admit it. Some part of me still saw this as a game. I was elated to discover that an institution as respected as SERN was actually doing time travel research. After all, we ourselves had succeeded -- whether by chance or design -- in producing our own time travel phenomenon. I thought that maybe we could beat SERN to the first functional time machine design. And wouldn't that be something? But now... Just like I said to Kurisu, the world is full of lies. Morals are meaningless. Was it really okay for us to get involved in this?
Itaru: H-hey, Okarin. Remember when we hacked in before? I'm pretty sure that email we read said this... Result: Error. Human is dead, mismatch. For details, see the Jellyman's Report...
UNSPOKEN: Someone... died?
Itaru: Could that have something to do with... human experimentation?
UNSPOKEN: My throat goes dry. Cold sweat seeps through my brow. And it's not because of the heat. Kurisu and Daru are waiting for me to speak. Are they entrusting the decision to me? True, but can I live with myself if I ignore this conspiracy?
Rintaro: Daru... look up the Jellyman's Report.
Itaru: Really?
Rintaro: Really. But first, Christina.
Kurisu: Eh?
Rintaro: You should leave.
Kurisu: Why are you suddenly--
Rintaro: The Jellyman's Report... it just gives me a bad feeling. Once we see it, we can no longer return to our normal lives. You're a genius. You're already published, for crying out loud. There's no need to throw away your promising future.
Kurisu: Are you worried about me?
Rintaro: Of course I am. You are my assistant, after all.
Kurisu: ...I keep telling you, I'm not your assistant. Thanks for your concern. But I'm not leaving. We need to expose this truth to the world.
Rintaro: No! It's too dangerous.
Kurisu: You chickening out?
Rintaro: We're powerless against this conspiracy. One wrong move, and they'll have us erased.
Kurisu: But still--
Rintaro: This isn't a game! I'm not joking here.
Kurisu: ...Fine. I won't tell anyone.
UNSPOKEN: Though her expression shows she still doesn't agree, she finally submits.
Kurisu: But I'm not leaving. It'll keep me awake at night.
Rintaro: You won't regret this?
