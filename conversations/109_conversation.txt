Rintaro: "Henceforth, this shall be known as Operation Laegjarn’s Chest!"
Kurisu: "Why Norse mythology?"
Itaru: "Is that Norse mythology? Because it’s cool, I guess."
Kurisu: "Anyway, what is it with men and military terms..."
Rintaro: "Daru, begin the operation!"
UNSPOKEN: He soon finds the Jellyman’s Report. It required a second password authentication, which Daru broke through easily.
Itaru: "Ready? I’m opening it."
UNSPOKEN: Daru looks at me and Kurisu. I wet my parched lips and nod. The air in the lab suddenly seems thicker. Unable to escape through the closed window, it surrounds us with an oppressive heat. Daru wipes the sweat off his forehead with a handkerchief, then timidly presses the enter key. The file opens. At first glance, it looks like a resume. There’s a photograph on the top right. The top left has name, age, height, weight, and other information. In the center is a long string of English text. Underneath that, there’s something attached, like a scan of a newspaper clipping with a black and white photo. And then I know. I know exactly what the Jellyman in Jellyman’s Report means.
Kurisu: "’Jellyman’s Report 10’ ’Subject: James McCarthy, Age: 31, American’ ’Z Program Stage 4, Date of Experiment: 2005-01-28 T13:05’"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu bends over Daru’s shoulder, reading the contents out loud.
Kurisu: "’Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.’"
Itaru: "That again..."
Kurisu: "’It is believed that due to infinite compression by supergravity, the subject could not endure passage through the singularity inside the Kerr black hole.’ ’April 3, 1921. New York City. An unidentified man was discovered dead in an alley off Union Square. The right half of his body was embedded in a nearby wall.’"
UNSPOKEN: It sounds like Kurisu is reading the newspaper article at the end.
Kurisu: "’The man’s body... ...was completely gelified.’"
UNSPOKEN: The ticking of the clock is like a hammer inside my head. It’s past 2 AM. The window is closed, and the lab is silent but for the humming of the computer. We stare at the gruesome image displayed on the monitor, speechless. I was right. We’re in too deep. I half expect guys in black suits and sunglasses to kick down the door and drag us off to a secret military prison. Better make sure the door’s locked.
Itaru: "What’s going on here?"
UNSPOKEN: Daru breaks the silence with a disbelieving whisper.
Itaru: "They... gelified someone?"
