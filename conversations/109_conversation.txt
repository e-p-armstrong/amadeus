Kurisu: 'Jellyman's Report 7.' 'Subject: Michael Lang, Age: 33, German' 'Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2002-10-8 T 13:28' 'Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.'
UNSPOKEN: The article clipping is written in Japanese. Looks like a pre-war newspaper. It even happened in Japan. I've never heard this story before. It was pre-war, though, so I guess someone born in the 90s like me would have no way of knowing about it. Next page. The picture shows a beach, beautiful but for the jellyfish-like body lying on the sand. It must have washed ashore. 
Kurisu: 'Jellyman's Report 6.' 'Subject: Mark Hughes, Age: 30, American' 'Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2002-8-23 T 12:52' 'Result: Error. Human is Dead. Mismatch.' 'On July 1, 1985, a strange body washed ashore on the coast of Streymoy, Faroe Islands.' 'It appeared to be the body of an adult male, but its flesh was soft like that of a jellyfish. Some of the island's inhabitants believe that it was the body of a merman.' 'The inscription 'SERN' was found near the body's shoulder, but SERN denies any involvement.'
Itaru: Keep looking?
Rintaro: I've seen enough.
UNSPOKEN: There are 14 of these people?
Kurisu: The sites are spread throughout the world. What can we deduce from this?
Rintaro: They must have sent them to those places.
Kurisu: I don't think so. It's too random.
Itaru: There was something about Kerr black holes and gravity, right? Isn't that the cause?
Kurisu: It is believed that due to infinite compression by supergravity, the subject could not endure passage through the Kerr black hole's singularity.' That's what it said.
Itaru: What's a Kerr black hole? Is it different from a regular black hole?
Kurisu: It's a theoretical black hole with a rotating singularity. Their existence hasn't been proven yet. Not that there's any way to prove one exists.
UNSPOKEN: Kerr black hole. Where have I heard that term before?
Rintaro: That's right... John Titor!
UNSPOKEN: Titor said his time machine used Kerr black holes.
Rintaro: According to Titor, SERN finished their time machine in 2034. And then Titor himself came from 2036.
UNSPOKEN: It makes sense for Titor and SERN to be using the same time travel technology. Kurisu closes her eyes in deep thought.
Kurisu: Creating Kerr black holes? That's insane. If you screw up, it could swallow the Earth... and besides, Kerr black holes are just a theoretical construct.
Rintaro: If Titor's predictions are a reality, then that means the LHC worst case scenario video on MewTube was right.
Itaru: I don't know about Titor's predictions, but I've seen the problem video before. It was on the news two or three years ago.
Kurisu: The gravitational forces inside a black hole are unbelievably powerful. It's certainly possible that passing through one could allow time displacement, but there's no way a human could do that and come out alive.
