Kurisu: It wouldn't just gelify you. It would tear you apart particle from particle. That's what a black hole does.
Itaru: Before we discuss this, shouldn't we look through the rest of their time machine research?
UNSPOKEN: Daru's already started pulling up new documents. I'm suddenly afraid. Is it okay to keep hacking SERN like this? Should I stop him? I'm the one who asked him to do it, but things have gotten serious now. But at the same time, irresistible curiosity wells up inside me. Time travel is becoming a reality. I want to know that it's true. I can't stop now.
Itaru: Here we go! There's a file in the Z Program that explains time travel theory.
Kurisu: That was pretty easy to find. SERN should have better security.
Itaru: Their security's fine. I'm just too good.
Rintaro: Daru is my Favorite Right Arm.
Kurisu: I thought he was your super hacka.
Itaru: Hacker!
Rintaro: So what does it say, Christina?
UNSPOKEN: This is in English too, so I have no choice but to rely on my assistant.
Kurisu: Umm... can you give me some time to read it?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's eyes dart left and right across the lines. Her earlier reluctance has vanished. It looks like she's as curious as I am.
Kurisu: No way... but this is... Is Titor really...?
Rintaro: What are you muttering about? Tell me what it says.
Kurisu: ...Oh, right. You know, this feels like one big joke.
Rintaro: What do you mean?
Kurisu: It's almost the same. The same as Titor's theory. Basically... The LHC smashes protons together at 99. 9999991% the speed of light. By doing so, they compress a mass of 10kg into an extremely tiny space of 10m.
Itaru: In Japanese please. Three lines max.
Kurisu: A small mass. Thrust into a narrow space. With great force.
UNSPOKEN: That explanation's too vague.
Itaru: That explanation's too erotic!
Kurisu: Huh? What part of it is erot-- ...Ah! H-Hashida, you pervert!!
Itaru: Sounds like you have a pretty good imagination yourself.
Kurisu: I-I'm not like you!
UNSPOKEN: Her blushing cheeks make her denial less than effective.
Rintaro: Don't listen to this fool, Christina. Continue.
Kurisu: ...ugh. Uh, what were we talking about?
Itaru: Thrusting with great force.
Rintaro: Proton compression.
Kurisu: Right. Successful compression generates a micro-singularity, which--
Itaru: A micro singularity? Not a mini black hole?
Rintaro: Same thing, essentially. A singularity is the core of a black hole.
Kurisu: This process generates a black hole with two micro-singularities.
UNSPOKEN: A black hole with two cores? Like a cowlick with two hairs? No, I don't think that's it...
Itaru: Explain with cute girls.
Kurisu: Fine. Say there are two cute girls, Mic-chan and Cro-chan.
Itaru: Sisters are moe. Haah, haah.
Kurisu: By feeding Mic-chan and Cro-chan electrons, you can make them do whatever you want.
Itaru: Electric shock torture? This some sort of eroge?
Kurisu: So you force them to rotate at an extremely high velocity. And then, theoretically, Mic-chan and Cro-chan transform into Magical Girl 'Ring Singularity'.
