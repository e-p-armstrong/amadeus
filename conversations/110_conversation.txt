UNSPOKEN: Kurisu speaks calmly despite her grim expression. She doesn’t even avert her eyes from the gruesome image.
Kurisu: "And this means they’ve created a time machine, doesn’t it? Even if it’s not perfect."
Rintaro: "Eh...?"
UNSPOKEN: I’m still in shock, so I don’t quite grasp the meaning of Kurisu’s words.
Kurisu: "This New York Times article is from 1921."
Rintaro: "90 years ago..."
Kurisu: "Look."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu points to part of the black and white photograph, her finger shaking slightly. The gelified corpse of a man. She’s pointing to his shoulder, which has writing on it. Perhaps it was printed on his clothes. It’s fused onto the gelified body, but you can somehow manage to read it.
Rintaro: "SERN..."
Itaru: "So... SERN used the LHC to send someone back to 1921?"
Kurisu: "Looks like they failed to keep him alive, though."
Rintaro: "Is this the only report?"
Itaru: "No, there’s more. Looks like... 14 people in total."
Rintaro: "More Jellymen? That means more gelified people... more victims of human experimentation..."
UNSPOKEN: I swallow hard. I’m awfully thirsty. I take a cold Dr P out of the fridge and wet my throat.
Rintaro: "Show me the others."
UNSPOKEN: Daru pulls up another report. Without being told to, Kurisu begins translating out loud.
Kurisu: "’Jellyman’s Report 9.’ ’Subject: Dan Strayski, Age: 26, Canadian.’ ’Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2004-9-6 T 14:10.’ ’Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.’ The newspaper clipping... I think it’s in French. I can’t read it."
Rintaro: "You can read the date, though. January 31, 2001."
Kurisu: "The location is... Pau, France, I guess."
UNSPOKEN: 2001. That’s fairly recent. A pretty big difference from James McCarthy, who jumped nearly 90 years back to 1921. Daru calls up a machine translation, giving us the following. Daru goes to the next report.
Kurisu: "’Jellyman’s Report 8.’ ’Subject: Linda Hill, Age: 25, British’ ’Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2004-2-15 T 13:45’ ’Results: Error. Human is Dead. Mismatch.’ ’October 2, 1972. The gelified body of a woman was discovered on the streets of Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu, India.’ ’There were signs that the body had been run over by a car.’"
UNSPOKEN: Daru goes to the next page.
Kurisu: "’Jellyman’s Report 7.’ ’Subject: Michael Lang, Age: 33, German’ ’Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2002-10-8 T 13:28’ ’Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.’"
