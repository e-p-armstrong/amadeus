Itaru: "Keep looking?"
Rintaro: "I’ve seen enough."
UNSPOKEN: There are 14 of these people?
Kurisu: "The sites are spread throughout the world. What can we deduce from this?"
Rintaro: "They must have sent them to those places."
Kurisu: "I don’t think so. It’s too random."
Itaru: "There was something about Kerr black holes and gravity, right? Isn’t that the cause?"
Kurisu: "It is believed that due to infinite compression by supergravity, the subject could not endure passage through the Kerr black hole’s singularity.’ That’s what it said."
Itaru: "What’s a Kerr black hole? Is it different from a regular black hole?"
Kurisu: "It’s a theoretical black hole with a rotating singularity. Their existence hasn’t been proven yet. Not that there’s any way to prove one exists."
UNSPOKEN: Kerr black hole. Where have I heard that term before?
Rintaro: "That’s right... John Titor!"
UNSPOKEN: Titor said his time machine used Kerr black holes.
Rintaro: "According to Titor, SERN finished their time machine in 2034. And then Titor himself came from 2036."
UNSPOKEN: It makes sense for Titor and SERN to be using the same time travel technology. Kurisu closes her eyes in deep thought.
Kurisu: "Creating Kerr black holes? That’s insane. If you screw up, it could swallow the Earth... and besides, Kerr black holes are just a theoretical construct."
Rintaro: "If Titor’s predictions are a reality, then that means the LHC worst case scenario video on MewTube was right."
Itaru: "I don’t know about Titor’s predictions, but I’ve seen the problem video before. It was on the news two or three years ago."
Kurisu: "The gravitational forces inside a black hole are unbelievably powerful. It’s certainly possible that passing through one could allow time displacement, but there’s no way a human could do that and come out alive."
Rintaro: "That must be how these people got gelified."
Kurisu: "It wouldn’t just gelify you. It would tear you apart particle from particle. That’s what a black hole does."
Itaru: "Before we discuss this, shouldn’t we look through the rest of their time machine research?"
UNSPOKEN: Daru’s already started pulling up new documents. I’m suddenly afraid. Is it okay to keep hacking SERN like this? Should I stop him? I’m the one who asked him to do it, but things have gotten serious now. But at the same time, irresistible curiosity wells up inside me. Time travel is becoming a reality. I want to know that it’s true. I can’t stop now.
Itaru: "Here we go! There’s a file in the Z Program that explains time travel theory."
Kurisu: "That was pretty easy to find. SERN should have better security."
Itaru: "Their security’s fine. I’m just too good."
Rintaro: "Daru is my Favorite Right Arm."
Kurisu: "I thought he was your super hacka."
Itaru: "Hacker!"
Rintaro: "So what does it say, Christina?"
UNSPOKEN: This is in English too, so I have no choice but to rely on my assistant.
Kurisu: "Umm... can you give me some time to read it?"
