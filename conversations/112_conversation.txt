UNSPOKEN: Oh? Moeka's lips curve into a smile.
Moeka: Hehehe...
UNSPOKEN: She rises to her feet unsteadily, then staggers off into the crowd. It's like she's forgotten about us completely. Mayuri and I can only watch her go. There's an indescribable aura about her that holds us back.
Mayuri: What do you think is wrong with Moeka-san?
UNSPOKEN: I've known she was kind of strange ever since I met her, but this... Maybe she's an escaped mental patient or something. Heh... not that her insanity can possibly compare to mine! For I desire nothing less than total and absolute chaos!
Rintaro: Muha, muhahaha, MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Mayuri: Whaaah? Now Okarin's acting weird! Mayushii's worried...
UNSPOKEN: Mayushii looks scared, so I cease my maniacal laughter a few minutes earlier than planned. Afterwards, Mayuri and I go our separate ways. She apparently has to deliver a costume to her friend Fubuki. When I return to the lab with my spoils of war, something surprising -- though not too surprising, come to think of it -- catches my eye.
Kurisu: Ah...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu is on the computer. As soon as she notices I've returned, she quickly closes the window on the screen.
Kurisu: H-hey! Think you could knock!?
Rintaro: This isn't your room. Besides, I'd have to be a fool to knock. There could be assassins lying in ambush.
Kurisu: Assassins? Here? Are you stupid?
Rintaro: Anyway, Christina. What were you looking at just now, hmm?
UNSPOKEN: I already know the answer, of course. I caught a glimpse of the screen before she closed it.
Kurisu: I was... doing research!
UNSPOKEN: Looks like she plans to continue this charade. I drop my bags and go to the computer.
Kurisu: S-stay back!
UNSPOKEN: I slip past Kurisu's blocking arms and restore the minimized window.
Kurisu: G-got a problem?
Rintaro: ...pfft!
Kurisu: Hey! What's with that 'this is awful, rofl rofl' laughter!?
Rintaro: Have no fear, Christina. Or should I call you... @channeler Chris!
Kurisu: Don't call me that!
Rintaro: Heh heh heh, I already knew. That's right! I realized long ago that you were an @channeler! You can't hide it from me. You reek of @channel corruption!
Kurisu: How rude! I make sure to apply light perfume every day!
Rintaro: Fool. That's not what I meant. I'm talking about the scent of your soul.
Kurisu: My soul? What's that supposed to mean? Explain.
Rintaro: Why? So you can learn how to hide it?
Kurisu: Sh-shut up! Just explain already.
Rintaro: There's nothing to explain. You use @channel memes in conversation. I'd have to be stupid not to notice.
Kurisu: ...Feels bad, man.
Rintaro: That's an @channel meme too.
Kurisu: Ugh...
Rintaro: Your soul is tainted with the essence of @channel. You cannot hide it, not in such close proximity to another who uses @channel memes in actual conversation. Your souls resonate.
Kurisu: That's it! It's all Hashida's fault!
Rintaro: But it's cute how you try to hide it, @channeler Chris.
Kurisu: DON'T CALL ME THAT.
UNSPOKEN: She glares at me hard. If looks could kill... She has no sense of humor at all. I should be more careful in the future.
Rintaro: But I don't understand. You were raised in America, so how are you so familiar with @channel?
Kurisu: You can browse @channel from America. Need I say more?
Rintaro: Ahh, I get it. Living in an English-only environment made you hungry for Japanese. But did you have to resort to @channel?
UNSPOKEN: I mean, if you believe the pseudo-intellectuals in the media, browsing @channel is like reading scribbles on the bathroom wall.
Kurisu: Sure, it's not the friendliest place, but I couldn't find anywhere that felt more 'Japanese'. Anyway, can I ask a favor?
