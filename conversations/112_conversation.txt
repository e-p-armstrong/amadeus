Rintaro: "What are you muttering about? Tell me what it says."
Kurisu: "...Oh, right. You know, this feels like one big joke."
Rintaro: "What do you mean?"
Kurisu: "It’s almost the same. The same as Titor’s theory. Basically... The LHC smashes protons together at 99. 9999991% the speed of light. By doing so, they compress a mass of 10kg into an extremely tiny space of 10m."
Itaru: "In Japanese please. Three lines max."
Kurisu: "A small mass. Thrust into a narrow space. With great force."
UNSPOKEN: That explanation’s too vague.
Itaru: "That explanation’s too erotic!"
Kurisu: "Huh? What part of it is erot-- ...Ah! H-Hashida, you pervert!!"
Itaru: "Sounds like you have a pretty good imagination yourself."
Kurisu: "I-I’m not like you!"
UNSPOKEN: Her blushing cheeks make her denial less than effective.
Rintaro: "Don’t listen to this fool, Christina. Continue."
Kurisu: "...ugh. Uh, what were we talking about?"
Itaru: "Thrusting with great force."
Rintaro: "Proton compression."
Kurisu: "Right. Successful compression generates a micro-singularity, which--"
Itaru: "A micro singularity? Not a mini black hole?"
Rintaro: "Same thing, essentially. A singularity is the core of a black hole."
Kurisu: "This process generates a black hole with two micro-singularities."
UNSPOKEN: A black hole with two cores? Like a cowlick with two hairs? No, I don’t think that’s it...
Itaru: "Explain with cute girls."
Kurisu: "Fine. Say there are two cute girls, Mic-chan and Cro-chan."
Itaru: "Sisters are moe. Haah, haah."
Kurisu: "By feeding Mic-chan and Cro-chan electrons, you can make them do whatever you want."
Itaru: "Electric shock torture? This some sort of eroge?"
Kurisu: "So you force them to rotate at an extremely high velocity. And then, theoretically, Mic-chan and Cro-chan transform into Magical Girl ’Ring Singularity’."
Itaru: "Cue stock transformation scene. Got it."
UNSPOKEN: Well, it looks like these two have found a common wavelength.
Kurisu: "The resulting black hole exhibits what’s called the Kerr effect."
Itaru: "What are Kerr black holes anyway? You said they spin, but what does that mean?"
Kurisu: "Exactly what it sounds like."
Itaru: "But don’t black holes usually spin? I mean, there’s a whirlpool around the hole, right?"
Kurisu: "The part that looks like it’s spinning is just the surrounding matter being sucked into the black hole. A black hole is just a point where extreme mass causes gravitational collapse. Everything falls towards it. Since it’s only a point, it doesn’t spin.  A Kerr black hole has a ring at its center, not a point. Think of it like this. Once transformed into magical girls, Mic-chan and Cro-chan’s hearts spin like a ring inside their bodies, which is impossible for normal people."
Itaru: "...I’ll pass on the guro."
Rintaro: "Before, you said that such a black hole’s existence would be impossible to prove. What did you mean?"
