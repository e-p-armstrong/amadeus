Kurisu: One thing I don't understand is how they inject electrons into the singularity. Look. This is a picture of the LHC, but there's strange equipment installed at the proton collision site. It looks like they call it a 'lifter', but... just what is it?
Rintaro: Daru, have you heard of it?
Itaru: Lifter, lifter... I think I saw that in the Z Program files. Wanna google it?
UNSPOKEN: Daru opens up a browser window and enters lifter into a search engine.
Itaru: We've got hits!
UNSPOKEN: About 422, 000 results.
Kurisu: That many? I guess it's not a secret...
Rintaro: Could this be it? Ionocraft.
Kurisu: Ions are charged particles. The meaning matches.
UNSPOKEN: We click on a link that says Ionocraft (lifter). It takes us to a video. Looks like some dim garage. But it doesn't seem like anything secretive. Just a garage like you'd see in an average American home. At the center of the screen is a triangular shape made of some kind of metal. It looks about 10 cm high, and about 30 cm wide. It's connected to some sort of generator by a thin wire. Looks like some really cheap equipment. That's all there is. Nothing else. After explaining something in some language I don't understand -- Russian, maybe? -- the person filming the video slowly turns the power on. And then--
Itaru: It's floating...
UNSPOKEN: The silvery triangle floats soundlessly into the air. Then it remains stationary.
Rintaro: That's... an anti-gravity device!
Kurisu: Don't be ridiculous. That would be the breakthrough of the century. It's called an ionocraft, so it probably has something to do with electrodes and charged air...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu doesn't sound as confident as she usually does. We look up information on the ionocraft lifter. Lots of sites have detailed instructions on how to make lifters, but I don't know how they work since the sites all give conflicting theories.
Rintaro: SERN is using this lifter technology. It's a vital component of their time machine. If they can manipulate a micro singularity's mass and gravitational field, then these things really are anti-gravity devices!
Kurisu: Well, under those exact conditions, I guess you might not be entirely wrong.
UNSPOKEN: Incredible! My curiosity's growing more by the second.
Kurisu: But it looks like SERN's having trouble adjusting their lifter. They don't have full control over the micro singularity's gravity. So they can't make a true naked singularity.
Rintaro: That must be the reason why the subjects turned into jellymen.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu nods.
Kurisu: Since the singularity is still closed, the subject is crushed by its tremendous gravity. As a result, substances become fractalized. Let's go with that hypothesis. Of course, there's no way to be sure that it's right. It might take months to prove.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu shrugs her shoulders in resignation.
Rintaro: So SERN's lifter is still incomplete...
UNSPOKEN: If Titor is telling the truth, then SERN won't complete their time machine for another 24 years.
Rintaro: If we can complete the PhoneWave (name subject to change) first, then we'll have outwitted SERN!
