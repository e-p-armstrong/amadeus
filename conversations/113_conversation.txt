UNSPOKEN: Kurisu turns away and mumbles something. But her voice is so low, I can't make it out.
Rintaro: If you have something to say, say it.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu turns bright red, but her sullen expression doesn't change.
Kurisu: Don't tell anyone else about this.
Rintaro: What difference does it make? Daru's the most hardcore @channeler who ever lived, and Mayuri's an otaku too. Even I browse @channel regularly. There's nothing to be ashamed of! Just boldly write 'Hobbies: Browsing @channel' on your resume!
Kurisu: Not a chance, you idiot!
Rintaro: What!? You mean you'd rather post anchors on VIP!?
Kurisu: Gh, I hate myself for understanding those words!
Rintaro: Well, whatever. If it will help you focus on the time leap machine, I'll keep your secret for now. Besides, it's just a matter of time before you make another mistake and reveal your true colors.
Kurisu: You don't have to worry about me. Remember that I represented my entire laboratory when we presented our research, even though there were men twice my age on the project. I'm an expert at dealing with people. I'll have no trouble keeping it a secret.
Rintaro: ...Nullpo.
Kurisu: Gah! No...!
