UNSPOKEN: I've met her parents any number of times. They're as ditzy as Mayuri. But still, I don't think they'd appreciate their underage daughter staying overnight in this dirty lab.
Rintaro: It must be my overwhelming charisma... No, wait, that makes me sound like a good person, so that can't be it... Of course! Mayuri's parents are so afraid of my insanity that they sent me their only daughter as a hostage!
Kurisu: Reported.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu calls out from the development room. She's been tinkering with the PhoneWave (name subject to change), but I guess she was listening.
Kurisu: What would you do if I called the cops on you?
Rintaro: I unleash my right arm on traitors, Christina.
Kurisu: Yeah, yeah, chuunibyou, whatever.
Mayuri: Um, I told Mom and Dad that Chris-chan would be here. Then they said okay.
Kurisu: Wait, so I have to stay too?
Mayuri: Yup♪ Don't you have to work on the PhoneWave?
Kurisu: I guess... but I don't relish the thought of spending the night here. At least, not with a certain somebody around.
Rintaro: Environment matters, Christina. This is a place of science and research, so you should have no trouble concentrating on your work. Trust the great Hououin Kyouma. Also, it may surprise you to learn that I have equipped this lab with a system that stimulates brain function. So if you were wondering where my incredible genius comes from, now you know! It's because I sleep in this room every night!
Kurisu: This stimulation system of yours... I assume it's been dumping toxic waste in your brain?
Rintaro: You sound like an environmentalist, Zombie.
Mayuri: Ah, Mayushii knows! You're talking about that, right?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu comes out of the development room to check what Mayuri's pointing at.
Kurisu: This... air freshener?
Mayuri: Okarin said the smell makes you smarter. He bought it at Akiba-o. When was that?
Rintaro: ...About six months ago. It was on sale for 500 yen.
Kurisu: I'm starting to think even you don't believe the stuff you say. And besides, this air freshener is empty.
UNSPOKEN: Yeah. When I went to buy replacement packs, they had already stopped selling them.
Kurisu: Well, whatever. I was planning to stay either way. I'll join you, Mayuri-san.
Mayuri: Really? That's great!
Kurisu: On one condition. Okabe leaves.
Rintaro: Me, leave? I practically live here! This lab was promised to me by Steins Gate. It's the dwelling place of my soul!
Kurisu: We girls are staying here overnight, so you filthy boys need to show respect. Your home isn't even far from here, right?
Mayuri: Okarin lives close to Mayushii, in Ikebukuro.
Kurisu: Why, that's less than 30 minutes by train. Anyway, I'm not going to need your help tonight, so just go home like a good boy, okay?
Rintaro: But I refuse.
Kurisu: What? Are you planning to molest us!?
Rintaro: Shut up, Mongolian Spot!
Kurisu: I don't have a Mongolian Spot! And when did you see my butt, anyway!?
Rintaro: I can't leave two young girls here alone! Minors need guardians!
Mayuri: But Okarin's a minor too!
Rintaro: I'll be 20 in less than a year and a half. In other words, Steins Gate has decided that I am an adult.
Kurisu: I'm pretty sure that makes you a minor just like us.
Mayuri: Um, Chris-chan? I don't think Okarin would do anything bad. I mean, we've been together for more than ten years, and he hasn't molested me once.
Kurisu: But he took you hostage, didn't he?
Mayuri: Yup♪ Actually, I'm still his hostage.
Kurisu: We should kick him out of the room.
