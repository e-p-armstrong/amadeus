Mayuri: Why can't they be found?
Itaru: Didn't you know, Mayu-shi? The world is constantly moving. Its rotational speed is 1500 kph, and its orbital speed is 114, 000 kph--
UNSPOKEN: Daru's tone is authoritative, but he's just relaying what he heard from Kurisu last night.
Kurisu: SERN has been looking for solutions, but it's not going well.
UNSPOKEN: So even SERN is having difficulties?
Rintaro: Now then. Have you learned anything that could help us complete the PhoneWave (name subject to change)?
Kurisu: Hmm...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu stares at the ceiling in thought.
Kurisu: Well, I suppose you could call the LHC the world's largest microwave oven.
Rintaro: Of course! In other words, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is a miniature LHC!
Kurisu: You might be on to something there.
UNSPOKEN: I was sure she'd deny it. In fact, I thought she'd yell at me. But instead, she agreed with me. Throws me off a little.
Kurisu: However, there are too many things we don't know about the PhoneWave. Why do the same phenomena that occur in SERN's time machine also occur in that tiny little microwave? Unlike the LHC, this thing wasn't made for time travel.
Mayuri: It was made to warm Mayushii's chicken!
Kurisu: W-well, yeah.
Rintaro: Since the jellyman phenomenon occurs with the PhoneWave (name subject to change), Mayuri's bananas must be reaching the Kerr black hole's ring singularity.
Mayuri: It makes a black hole? Here? It won't suck us in, will it?
UNSPOKEN: If it sucked us in, we'd become jellymen too.
Kurisu: But we still haven't figured out the electric discharge phenomenon, or the conditions required to cause it.
Itaru: During our experiments earlier, we were only able to send emails to the past during the discharge.
Rintaro: Although it hasn't happened again, that discharge phenomenon could very well signify the injection of charge -- that is, electrons. And only when it occurs does the path to the singularity open.
Kurisu: We don't know the cause of the discharge phenomenon.
Rintaro: That's what we need to find out.
Kurisu: In the first place, the emails we're sending to the past are digital data, not physical objects. That's a definite difference from SERN's time machine.
Rintaro: No, we're doing the same thing. Who's to say that digital data can't go through a singularity? I think it would be easier than sending something human-sized.
Kurisu: Well... I suppose that's true.
Mayuri: You know, the way you guys talk about email... It makes me think of folding a letter into a paper airplane and making it go zoom, you know?
Rintaro: It's more like a beam of light. Like optical digital data. By the way, it's a pain to keep saying 'email sent to the past'. Let's give it a proper name.
Kurisu: I've got a bad feeling about this.
Rintaro: What's that supposed to mean? You dare mock Hououin Kyouma!?
Kurisu: You just want to give it some oddball name, don't you?
