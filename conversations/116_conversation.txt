Kurisu: Confusing. Rejected.
Rintaro: Why you! Who gave you the authority to reject my ideas!? You're just an assistant!
Kurisu: Then why don't we take a vote? All in favor of Nostalgia Drive.
UNSPOKEN: My hand shoots into the air. But nobody follows suit.
Rintaro: Have you forsaken me, Daru!? Mayuri!?
Mayuri: Chris-chan's right. It's too hard for Mayushii to remember.
Itaru: It's way too chuuni, man.
UNSPOKEN: Traitors!
Rintaro: Fine! Then let's hear alternatives! Don't tell me you rejected my idea without having any bright ideas of your own!?
Kurisu: I think it needs to be something easy to understand. It's an email that regresses through time, so how about Retromail?
Mayuri: What does 'retro' mean?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri is busy eating strawberry jelly. How can she eat that stuff after hearing about jellymen?
Rintaro: Sounds like you have your answer, Christina. You said it should be easy to understand, but it wasn't easy to understand at all, was it!?
Kurisu: B-but that's because Mayuri-san is... Uh, n-never mind...
Rintaro: Were you about to say 'because Mayuri's dumb'?
Kurisu: N-no!
Mayuri: Eh? Chris-chan, do you think Mayushii's dumb?
Kurisu: I don't! I promise I don't! Okay?
UNSPOKEN: Somehow, Kurisu manages to glare at me even while soothing Mayuri.
Itaru: I vote 'The Mail Who Leapt through Time'.
Rintaro: That's too stiff. It's hard to say.
Itaru: It's better than your 'Nostalagisticexpialidocious' nonsense! And mine makes a movie title referen--
Rintaro: That's not cool. It needs to be cool.
Itaru: You're rejecting it for that?
Mayuri: Tutturuâ™ª Mayushii has an idea! How about 'Back to the Mail'? I took a movie title, and changed a word to mail!
Itaru: I already did the movie joke, Mayu-shi.
Kurisu: Besides, I think the meaning is a little off.
UNSPOKEN: She probably meant Mail to the Future, but our emails go to the past.
Mayuri: It's not about the meaning... I took a movie title and changed a word to mail...
Rintaro: Either way, it's too long!
Itaru: Then how about DeLorean Mail?
Rintaro: That doesn't even say what kind of email it is!
Kurisu: Hey. We don't have time for this nonsense. Let's just abbreviate it to 'D-Mail' and move on.
Rintaro: But that's boring.
Kurisu: It don't care if it's boring.
UNSPOKEN: Shot down. Kurisu's influence in the lab seems to have grown significantly these past few days.
Mayuri: D-Mail it is!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri, finished with her jelly, proclaims in satisfaction. Wait, when did Mayuri become the moderator?
Itaru: So why does the D-Mail phenomenon occur?
Rintaro: Because the path through the ring singularity is open. We've been over this already.
Kurisu: We don't know if there's actually a black hole at work here. It could be an entirely different phenomenon that just happens to resemble SERN's experiments. It's dangerous to jump to conclusions.
