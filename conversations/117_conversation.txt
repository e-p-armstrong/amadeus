Rintaro: "Christina! I ordered you to investigate SERN! What have you learned?"
Kurisu: "I don’t remember being ordered, but whatever. There are two problems SERN faces with time travel. First is the electron injection device, also known as a ’lifter’. Unless they get it to function properly, they can’t make the Kerr black hole singularites naked. If you send a test subject through the singularity in its current state, the supergravity compresses them to the micro level. Naturally, there’s no way to survive. The second problem is that they can’t specify a physical destination. They can’t choose where they end up after traveling to the past. That’s why I’d say the 14 found jellymen were the lucky ones. Over a hundred human experiments have been performed since 2001. The remaining 80 or so people ended up somewhere they can’t be found."
Mayuri: "Why can’t they be found?"
Itaru: "Didn’t you know, Mayu-shi? The world is constantly moving. Its rotational speed is 1500 kph, and its orbital speed is 114, 000 kph--"
UNSPOKEN: Daru’s tone is authoritative, but he’s just relaying what he heard from Kurisu last night.
Kurisu: "SERN has been looking for solutions, but it’s not going well."
UNSPOKEN: So even SERN is having difficulties?
Rintaro: "Now then. Have you learned anything that could help us complete the PhoneWave (name subject to change)?"
Kurisu: "Hmm..."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu stares at the ceiling in thought.
Kurisu: "Well, I suppose you could call the LHC the world’s largest microwave oven."
Rintaro: "Of course! In other words, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is a miniature LHC!"
Kurisu: "You might be on to something there."
UNSPOKEN: I was sure she’d deny it. In fact, I thought she’d yell at me. But instead, she agreed with me. Throws me off a little.
Kurisu: "However, there are too many things we don’t know about the PhoneWave. Why do the same phenomena that occur in SERN’s time machine also occur in that tiny little microwave? Unlike the LHC, this thing wasn’t made for time travel."
Mayuri: "It was made to warm Mayushii’s chicken!"
Kurisu: "W-well, yeah."
Rintaro: "Since the jellyman phenomenon occurs with the PhoneWave (name subject to change), Mayuri’s bananas must be reaching the Kerr black hole’s ring singularity."
Mayuri: "It makes a black hole? Here? It won’t suck us in, will it?"
UNSPOKEN: If it sucked us in, we’d become jellymen too.
Kurisu: "But we still haven’t figured out the electric discharge phenomenon, or the conditions required to cause it."
Itaru: "During our experiments earlier, we were only able to send emails to the past during the discharge."
Rintaro: "Although it hasn’t happened again, that discharge phenomenon could very well signify the injection of charge -- that is, electrons. And only when it occurs does the path to the singularity open."
Kurisu: "We don’t know the cause of the discharge phenomenon."
