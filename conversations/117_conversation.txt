Itaru: Do you really think that's possible?
Rintaro: There is no think. Only do!
Kurisu: What, did you read that off a motivational poster? You're like the classic incompetent boss.
Rintaro: Damn you! You dare insult the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!?
Itaru: Well, it's not like Okarin's the boss anyway.
Rintaro: Indeed. I am the symbol of this lab, not the boss.
Kurisu: I don't know what you mean by symbol, but how do you plan to turn the PhoneWave into a time machine? Let's have details.
Rintaro: My plan... alright, there is one thing. We've been thinking that the electrical discharge happens at random, but I have a hypothesis.
Kurisu: Which is?
UNSPOKEN: I look at my watch. It's past noon.
Rintaro: Recall the conditions when it occurred, Christina. We experimented through the night with no results, but there's one variable we overlooked. The simplest, most definitive variable of all. That is, the time of the occurrence.
Kurisu: ...ah.
Rintaro: I checked the times of the two previous occurrences. When I accidentally sent the first D-Mail to Daru's phone, it happened between noon and one PM. The second time, when all four of us observed the D-Mail, it was six PM. So if we perform the experiment within that timeframe, we might be able to reproduce the effect.
Kurisu: Let's try it right now!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu bolts into the development room, suddenly bursting with enthusiasm.
Itaru: Well, I'm glad to see she has her priorities straight.
Mayuri: Mayushii's banana supply is getting low... gotta buy more.
UNSPOKEN: Only one banana remains untouched. We got rid of the gelified bananas, and then we ate the rest.
Kurisu: Sorry, Mayuri-san. I'll go buy you some new bananas later.
Mayuri: Really? Yay♪ Okarin and Daru-kun eat my bananas, but they never buy new ones...
UNSPOKEN: I'll be sure to amend that in the future. A bunch of bananas is a small price to pay in order to bring chaos to the world. Kurisu picks the last banana off the stem, leans under the table, and places it inside the microwave.
Kurisu: First, let's see if it'll become a jellyman. Agh!
UNSPOKEN: She tries to get up and gloriously bangs her head underneath the table.
Rintaro: Trying for the clumsy girl appeal?
Kurisu: It was an accident!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu gets up, blushing in embarrassment with tears in her eyes.
Kurisu: Put the microwave somewhere else! It's dangerous and hard to reach like this.
Rintaro: It'll punch through the floor if we put it on the table.
Mayuri: Chris-chan, Chris-chan! Pain, pain, go away♪
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri pats the back of Kurisu's head, then sweeps her hand through the air.
Kurisu: Thanks, Mayuri-san.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu pulls herself together, types on her phone, and activates the PhoneWave (name subject to change). The banana inside the microwave slowly begins to spin backwards as the timer counts down.
Kurisu: Ah!
