Rintaro: A little silence please, Mister Braun! This is a most glorious moment, for I have just been chosen as the ruler of all space and time! MUHAHAHAHAHA! Guh!
UNSPOKEN: Stars explode behind my eyes as Mister Braun drives his fist into the top of my head. The world spins. I struggle to get ahold of my shaken brain.
Rintaro: You... dare lay hands on the great...
Tennouji: Got somethin' to say?
Rintaro: Heh... heh heh... well then, Mister Braun... put it on my tab!
UNSPOKEN: With that, I fly out of the workshop. I rub my head. It hurts like hell. Damn that Mister Braun. Did he really have to crack me so hard? Maybe I should report him for assault. Thanks to his brutality, I had to make a strategic retreat. Fortunately, I did not emerge empty handed. The extra ten thousand yen a month will hurt, but in exchange, I have acquired information essential to the success of my plan.
Rintaro: All's well that ends well! Muhahaha!
Mayuri: Okarin! The building just shook. Are you okay?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri and Kurisu appear in the second story window.
Kurisu: Looks like you really are unkillable.
Rintaro: Heh heh heh. I have seen the future, Christina. In three minutes, you will be on your knees praising my greatness!
Kurisu: I don't think so.
UNSPOKEN: I run up the stairs.
Kurisu: How could you miss something so obvious?
UNSPOKEN: When I tell Kurisu about the 42-inch CRT downstairs, that is her first reaction.
Rintaro: Why are you blaming me?
Kurisu: ...I'm not blaming you. I'm just disappointed that nobody, including myself, noticed.
Itaru: We missed the forest for the trees.
Rintaro: To summarize... Just now, when the PhoneWave (name subject to change) shook the building, the 42-inch CRT was on. But when Mister Braun turned the TV off, the shaking stopped immediately.
Kurisu: The discharge was interrupted. I put a banana in just to be sure. Nothing happened.
Mayuri: I'm glad. We shouldn't waste food.
UNSPOKEN: Nobody replies to Mayuri's off-point statement. We're busy reading about cathode ray tubes on the Internet. It doesn't take long before we find something interesting. A cathode ray tube has a component called an electron gun, which uses extreme heat and a strong electric field to accelerate electrons and turn them into a beam. The electron beam striking the TV screen's phosphor layer is what generates the picture. An electron gun could certainly work as a lifter.
Kurisu: We've found the answer. The electrons emitted by the 42-inch CRT are holding the PhoneWave's black hole open. And the discharge phenomenon is the result.
Itaru: So the reason we can't use the PhoneWave at night is because the Braun Tube Workshop's closed?
UNSPOKEN: The Braun Tube Workshop doesn't have especially strict business hours, but it's usually open from around 11 AM to 7 PM. That matches up perfectly with my observation that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) only works between noon and 6 PM. The few instances it hasn't worked during that timeframe can be explained by the TV being off.
Rintaro: But how can a cathode ray tube emit such a strong electron stream?
Kurisu: It's not about having a strong electron stream. If stronger were better, SERN would've solved the lifter problem long ago.
UNSPOKEN: I see. So it can't be too strong or too weak. By freak coincidence, the 42-inch CRT's electron gun appears to have exactly the right level of electron discharge. That's the only explanation.
Kurisu: Somehow, the conditions here were perfect to create a time machine. Frankly, it's a miracle.
Rintaro: No, Christina! Not a miracle! This is the choice of Steins Gate!
UNSPOKEN: Rather than glare at me as she has so many times in the past, Kurisu shoots me an exasperated smile.
Kurisu: Whatever it is, it worked.
