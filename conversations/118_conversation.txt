Kurisu: "In the first place, the emails we’re sending to the past are digital data, not physical objects. That’s a definite difference from SERN’s time machine."
Rintaro: "No, we’re doing the same thing. Who’s to say that digital data can’t go through a singularity? I think it would be easier than sending something human-sized."
Kurisu: "Well... I suppose that’s true."
Mayuri: "You know, the way you guys talk about email... It makes me think of folding a letter into a paper airplane and making it go zoom, you know?"
Rintaro: "It’s more like a beam of light. Like optical digital data. By the way, it’s a pain to keep saying ’email sent to the past’. Let’s give it a proper name."
Kurisu: "I’ve got a bad feeling about this."
Rintaro: "What’s that supposed to mean? You dare mock Hououin Kyouma!?"
Kurisu: "You just want to give it some oddball name, don’t you?"
Rintaro: "Hmph! How rude. Heed me! I shall name the phenomenon of ’email sent to the past’ as follows. The name shall be... Nostalgia Drive!"
Kurisu: "Confusing. Rejected."
Rintaro: "Why you! Who gave you the authority to reject my ideas!? You’re just an assistant!"
Kurisu: "Then why don’t we take a vote? All in favor of Nostalgia Drive."
UNSPOKEN: My hand shoots into the air. But nobody follows suit.
Rintaro: "Have you forsaken me, Daru!? Mayuri!?"
Mayuri: "Chris-chan’s right. It’s too hard for Mayushii to remember."
Itaru: "It’s way too chuuni, man."
UNSPOKEN: Traitors!
Rintaro: "Fine! Then let’s hear alternatives! Don’t tell me you rejected my idea without having any bright ideas of your own!?"
Kurisu: "I think it needs to be something easy to understand. It’s an email that regresses through time, so how about Retromail?"
Mayuri: "What does ’retro’ mean?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri is busy eating strawberry jelly. How can she eat that stuff after hearing about jellymen?
Rintaro: "Sounds like you have your answer, Christina. You said it should be easy to understand, but it wasn’t easy to understand at all, was it!?"
Kurisu: "B-but that’s because Mayuri-san is... Uh, n-never mind..."
Rintaro: "Were you about to say ’because Mayuri’s dumb’?"
Kurisu: "N-no!"
Mayuri: "Eh? Chris-chan, do you think Mayushii’s dumb?"
Kurisu: "I don’t! I promise I don’t! Okay?"
UNSPOKEN: Somehow, Kurisu manages to glare at me even while soothing Mayuri.
Itaru: "I vote ’The Mail Who Leapt through Time’."
Rintaro: "That’s too stiff. It’s hard to say."
Itaru: "It’s better than your ’Nostalagisticexpialidocious’ nonsense! And mine makes a movie title referen--"
Rintaro: "That’s not cool. It needs to be cool."
Itaru: "You’re rejecting it for that?"
Mayuri: "Tutturu♪ Mayushii has an idea! How about ’Back to the Mail’? I took a movie title, and changed a word to mail!"
