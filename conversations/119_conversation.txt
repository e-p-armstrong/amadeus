Kurisu: "Besides, I think the meaning is a little off."
UNSPOKEN: She probably meant Mail to the Future, but our emails go to the past.
Mayuri: "It’s not about the meaning... I took a movie title and changed a word to mail..."
Rintaro: "Either way, it’s too long!"
Itaru: "Then how about DeLorean Mail?"
Rintaro: "That doesn’t even say what kind of email it is!"
Kurisu: "Hey. We don’t have time for this nonsense. Let’s just abbreviate it to ’D-Mail’ and move on."
Rintaro: "But that’s boring."
Kurisu: "It don’t care if it’s boring."
UNSPOKEN: Shot down. Kurisu’s influence in the lab seems to have grown significantly these past few days.
Mayuri: "D-Mail it is!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri, finished with her jelly, proclaims in satisfaction. Wait, when did Mayuri become the moderator?
Itaru: "So why does the D-Mail phenomenon occur?"
Rintaro: "Because the path through the ring singularity is open. We’ve been over this already."
Kurisu: "We don’t know if there’s actually a black hole at work here. It could be an entirely different phenomenon that just happens to resemble SERN’s experiments. It’s dangerous to jump to conclusions."
Rintaro: "Why so timid? Don’t you want our time travel experiments to succeed? That’s why we put our lives on the line to hack SERN! What we need to figure out is how to turn the PhoneWave (name subject to change) into a usable time machine."
Itaru: "Do you really think that’s possible?"
Rintaro: "There is no think. Only do!"
Kurisu: "What, did you read that off a motivational poster? You’re like the classic incompetent boss."
Rintaro: "Damn you! You dare insult the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!?"
Itaru: "Well, it’s not like Okarin’s the boss anyway."
Rintaro: "Indeed. I am the symbol of this lab, not the boss."
Kurisu: "I don’t know what you mean by symbol, but how do you plan to turn the PhoneWave into a time machine? Let’s have details."
Rintaro: "My plan... alright, there is one thing. We’ve been thinking that the electrical discharge happens at random, but I have a hypothesis."
Kurisu: "Which is?"
UNSPOKEN: I look at my watch. It’s past noon.
Rintaro: "Recall the conditions when it occurred, Christina. We experimented through the night with no results, but there’s one variable we overlooked. The simplest, most definitive variable of all. That is, the time of the occurrence."
Kurisu: "...ah."
Rintaro: "I checked the times of the two previous occurrences. When I accidentally sent the first D-Mail to Daru’s phone, it happened between noon and one PM. The second time, when all four of us observed the D-Mail, it was six PM. So if we perform the experiment within that timeframe, we might be able to reproduce the effect."
Kurisu: "Let’s try it right now!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu bolts into the development room, suddenly bursting with enthusiasm.
Itaru: "Well, I’m glad to see she has her priorities straight."
