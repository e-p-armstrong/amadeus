UNSPOKEN: Kurisu starts laughing when she sees the mail, even though she's the one who wrote it. The OKABE in the first one is obviously my name. But what does AIRHEAD in the second one mean? My English is shaky. Is she saying my head can fly or something? Whatever. I may not know what it means, but I do know this. My assistant is making fun of me. But that doesn't matter right now.
Rintaro: Christina. Did you send two mails?
Kurisu: Eh? No. I only sent one.
Mayuri: Mayushii saw it too. She really only sent one.
Rintaro: But I received two.
Kurisu: You're right... I even sent it in one sentence, but it got divided.
Rintaro: By the way, what does this word mean?
Kurisu: Why don't you look it up?
UNSPOKEN: I guess she doesn't want to answer.
Itaru: That reminds me. The D-Mail from before was cut up mid-sentence too.
Rintaro: Was it?
Itaru: Yeah. Look at your history. I'm pretty sure I sent 'Okarin's a perv'.
Rintaro: You're right. This one got split too.
Kurisu: I wonder what's causing it.
Rintaro: Maybe it's related to the jellymen.
Mayuri: Um, Mayushii wants to know why it arrived five days ago.
Kurisu: Good point. Didn't the last one also arrive five days before we sent it?
Rintaro: Yeah. It did.
Itaru: Is there some kind of rule for when it arrives?
Mayuri: Let's try sending more!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri's right. Now that we've figured out how to send D-Mails, we should keep experimenting and collect as much data as we can.
Rintaro: Alright, lab mems! Battle stations!
Kurisu: He's at it again...
Rintaro: Our mission: to send as many D-Mails as possible! Daru, man the X68000. Your job is to observe, adjust, and gather information on the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Assistant, keep those mails coming! Try various patterns of text. Japanese, English, full-width, half-width, emoticons. The actual messages don't matter.
UNSPOKEN: I'm sure Shining Finger would be better for the job, but since she's not a lab mem, I'll leave it to Kurisu.
Mayuri: What about Mayushii?
Rintaro: Your mission is to go shopping. Just buy some bananas for now. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall fund you!
Mayuri: Wow! You're so generousâ™ª
Kurisu: So I guess your job is opening the microwave.
Itaru: Whoa! You saved the easiest job for yourself?
Rintaro: Heh. No, my assistant's judgment is sound. The key to a successful D-Mail is most likely the correct timing of opening the microwave door!
Kurisu: Uh, I was just kidding.
Rintaro: MUHAHAHAHA! Leave this task to Hououin Kyouma! I shall open this door with precision, boldness, and delicacy, as if it were the flesh of a beautiful woman!
Mayuri: Okarin, that's naughty!
Rintaro: Furthermore, the current operation is top secret. You must not leak it to anyone. Got it?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri nods. The others are ignoring me.
Rintaro: Now I shall give this operation a name! It shall be known as Op--
