UNSPOKEN: Mayuri looks up from her costume with a question in her eyes.
Mayuri: So, um, what do we have to do to complete Super PhoneWave-chan?
Kurisu: Now that we've found the cause, there's nothing left to hold us back. We can safely conclude that time leaping is possible when, and only when, that television is on.
Itaru: We should probably test it, right? And there's still the final check of the PhoneWave to do.
Kurisu: You're right. Okabe.
Rintaro: What?
Kurisu: Go downstairs and turn that TV back on.
Rintaro: Ha. Ha. Ha. That's hilarious, Christina. Allow me to dub that... Mission: Impossible!
UNSPOKEN: I'm not going back down there. My head still hurts from last time! Next time, I doubt I'll make it out alive.
Kurisu: Whatever. Just go already.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu orders me with a sour look. It's like I'm the assistant here.
Kurisu: If anyone can do it, it's you. You made an amazing discovery just now, didn't you?
Rintaro: Assistant mine... have you finally recognized my greatness as a mad scientist?
Kurisu: No.
Rintaro: Ah.
Itaru: Damn. That was harsh.
Kurisu: Oh, whoops. I was supposed to flatter him so he'd feel like going, right? Yes, you're an amazing mad scientist.
Rintaro: It's too late!
Kurisu: Anyway, now that we've found the lifter, the time leap machine is 99% complete.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's expression suddenly turns serious, but I can see the hunger in her eyes and the flush of excitement on her cheeks. She knows that we stand on the threshold of a new age in science, and she cannot resist the lure of the unknown. She's a true scientist. No doubt about it.
Kurisu: It's your dream, isn't it? To invent a time machine.
UNSPOKEN: Our dream... I've never really thought about it that way. But she's right. My hands are shaking. Not from fear of Mister Braun, but from excitement.
Rintaro: I will become the undisputed lord of time. With that power, I will shatter the System and Chaos will rule the--
Kurisu: Okabe.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu interrupts my speech.
Kurisu: I wasn't asking Hououin Kyouma. I was asking Okabe.
