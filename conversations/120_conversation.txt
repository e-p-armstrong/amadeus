Rintaro: Wha... but...
UNSPOKEN: You ruined my climactic scene! Damn you, assistant! This is an outrage! Afterwards, the D-Mail experiment -- its name is Operation Urd, though I lost my chance to announce it -- continues for two hours. During that time, every D-Mail goes back in time without a hitch. Now it's time to take a break. We're all hungry, and except for Mayuri, we've been up since last night.
Kurisu: Go ahead and rest. I'm gonna have a go at it a little longer.
UNSPOKEN: She's been going at it for hours and she's still full of energy. It's hard to believe she was so opposed to time travel research before. Her scientist's blood must be on fire. We've made a number of discoveries, but we can wait to assess them until after we eat. Daru and I leave the two girls to watch over the lab as we go shopping at the convenience store. We return from the convenience store to find the Braun Tube Workshop's one and only Part-Time Warrior standing in front of the building. She's stretching.
Suzuha: Sup!
UNSPOKEN: She notices me and calls out without stopping her exercises.
Suzuha: What shenanigans are you up to this early in the morning?
UNSPOKEN: Shenanigans? This girl has a thing for unusual words.
Rintaro: The kind you wouldn't believe. We're building the first time machine in human history.
Suzuha: Huh. Cool.
Rintaro: Hey, shouldn't you be more surprised!?
Itaru: Can't blame her for being skeptical. I didn't think it was possible either. And isn't that top secret? I thought you didn't want anyone to know.
Rintaro: Crap! Part-Time Warrior, please keep what I just said a secret.
Suzuha: Sure. By the way...
UNSPOKEN: Part-Time Warrior glances at the Braun Tube Workshop.
Suzuha: The boss is really pissed.
Rintaro: Why?
Suzuha: The noise. Whatever you're doing up there, it's got the whole building shaking. Dust everywhere. Kinda like an air raid. He was saying stuff like 'What's that nutcase doing? I'mma raise his damn rent!' Maybe you should go apologize.
Itaru: Oh boy. What if he kicks us out?
Rintaro: Alright, leave it to me. Daru, go tell my assistant to lay off the experiments for now.
Itaru: Roger that... I won't forget you, soldier.
UNSPOKEN: Daru salutes, then races up to the second floor.
Suzuha: ...By the way, is Makise Kurisu here too?
Rintaro: Yeah.
UNSPOKEN: Come to think of it, she did pick a fight with Christina yesterday.
Rintaro: Have you met before?
Suzuha: Um... no. Yesterday was first contact.
Rintaro: First contact?
UNSPOKEN: That's a strange way of putting it.
Rintaro: Oh. Really? Weren't you a little hostile for a first contact?
Suzuha: She's... my enemy.
