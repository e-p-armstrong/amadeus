UNSPOKEN: Only one banana remains untouched. We got rid of the gelified bananas, and then we ate the rest.
Kurisu: "Sorry, Mayuri-san. I’ll go buy you some new bananas later."
Mayuri: "Really? Yay♪ Okarin and Daru-kun eat my bananas, but they never buy new ones..."
UNSPOKEN: I’ll be sure to amend that in the future. A bunch of bananas is a small price to pay in order to bring chaos to the world. Kurisu picks the last banana off the stem, leans under the table, and places it inside the microwave.
Kurisu: "First, let’s see if it’ll become a jellyman. Agh!"
UNSPOKEN: She tries to get up and gloriously bangs her head underneath the table.
Rintaro: "Trying for the clumsy girl appeal?"
Kurisu: "It was an accident!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu gets up, blushing in embarrassment with tears in her eyes.
Kurisu: "Put the microwave somewhere else! It’s dangerous and hard to reach like this."
Rintaro: "It’ll punch through the floor if we put it on the table."
Mayuri: "Chris-chan, Chris-chan! Pain, pain, go away♪"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri pats the back of Kurisu’s head, then sweeps her hand through the air.
Kurisu: "Thanks, Mayuri-san."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu pulls herself together, types on her phone, and activates the PhoneWave (name subject to change). The banana inside the microwave slowly begins to spin backwards as the timer counts down.
Kurisu: "Ah!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu, who is peering into the microwave, suddenly shouts in surprise. The banana has vanished. At the exact same moment, the banana reappears on its stem, gelified.
Itaru: "Whoa!"
Mayuri: "It became a gelbana..."
Rintaro: "Heh heh heh... muhahaha... MUHAHAHAHA! Just as I suspected, the critical variable was time!"
UNSPOKEN: I was a little anxious about the result, but it all worked out. I outwitted the impertinent genius girl. Now my position as symbol of the lab is secure!
Kurisu: "W-way to go, Okabe. It was so simple, I didn’t notice it."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu says with a slightly sulky expression.
Rintaro: "Your praise does you credit, Christina, but I know you’re frustrated you didn’t think of it first. Muhahahaha!"
Kurisu: "Anyway, let’s see if we can send another D-Mail."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu ignores my proud laughter and excitedly starts typing out a mail.
Rintaro: "Guh... I feel like my authority has been on the decline since that girl showed up."
Itaru: "It’s cool, man. You never had any to begin with."
Kurisu: "Help me, you two! Okabe, I’m sending an email to your phone."
UNSPOKEN: When did I become her assistant? I grind my teeth in frustration, but I do as I’m told and insert my phone into the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s slot.
Mayuri: "What are you gonna send, Chris-chan?"
