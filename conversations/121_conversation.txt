Suzuha: Yeah.
Rintaro: Did she do something to you?
Suzuha: Not to me.
Rintaro: What does that mean? She did something to someone else? If you want, I can go talk things over with Christina.
Suzuha: It doesn't really matter.
Rintaro: Maybe you're blaming the wrong person?
Suzuha: Geez! Give it a rest!
UNSPOKEN: She hits me with a glare.
Suzuha: Anyway! Shouldn't you apologize to the boss instead of talking to me?
UNSPOKEN: Heh. Actually, I'm getting cold feet. But I am Hououin Kyouma, the mad scientist who brings chaos to the world. I can't falter now. I steel myself and enter the Braun Tube Workshop. Part-Time Warrior follows me inside.
Rintaro: I have come!
UNSPOKEN: Mister Braun is sitting at the counter inside, slurping delivery ramen. Even when I enter, he doesn't look away from the huge 42-inch CRT. It's showing some news show's report on some celebrity divorce. Part-Time Warrior doesn't say anything. She's just going to stand there and watch him rip me a new one.
Tennouji: Hey, Okabe. The hell are you doing up there?
UNSPOKEN: Straight to the punch. He doesn't take his eyes off the TV, nor does he stop slurping his ramen. Yet despite his sedentary posture, he exudes extraordinary pressure. But now is not the time to falter.
Rintaro: We're currently conducting experiments that will change the course of human history. The discoveries we make today will shape the world for centur--
Tennouji: I don't care what games you guys play. I'm the owner of this building. Got it? And the building's really worn out. You keep shaking it like that, you could bring the whole damn thing down on our heads.
UNSPOKEN: Better keep quiet about the dent in the floor.
Rintaro: Heh heh heh... Veeery interesting, Mister Braun. Don't tell me you forged this building's earthquake safety certificate?
