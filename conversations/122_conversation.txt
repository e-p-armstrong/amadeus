Rintaro: "Yeah. It did."
Itaru: "Is there some kind of rule for when it arrives?"
Mayuri: "Let’s try sending more!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri’s right. Now that we’ve figured out how to send D-Mails, we should keep experimenting and collect as much data as we can.
Rintaro: "Alright, lab mems! Battle stations!"
Kurisu: "He’s at it again..."
Rintaro: "Our mission: to send as many D-Mails as possible! Daru, man the X68000. Your job is to observe, adjust, and gather information on the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Assistant, keep those mails coming! Try various patterns of text. Japanese, English, full-width, half-width, emoticons. The actual messages don’t matter."
UNSPOKEN: I’m sure Shining Finger would be better for the job, but since she’s not a lab mem, I’ll leave it to Kurisu.
Mayuri: "What about Mayushii?"
Rintaro: "Your mission is to go shopping. Just buy some bananas for now. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall fund you!"
Mayuri: "Wow! You’re so generous♪"
Kurisu: "So I guess your job is opening the microwave."
Itaru: "Whoa! You saved the easiest job for yourself?"
Rintaro: "Heh. No, my assistant’s judgment is sound. The key to a successful D-Mail is most likely the correct timing of opening the microwave door!"
Kurisu: "Uh, I was just kidding."
Rintaro: "MUHAHAHAHA! Leave this task to Hououin Kyouma! I shall open this door with precision, boldness, and delicacy, as if it were the flesh of a beautiful woman!"
Mayuri: "Okarin, that’s naughty!"
Rintaro: "Furthermore, the current operation is top secret. You must not leak it to anyone. Got it?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri nods. The others are ignoring me.
Rintaro: "Now I shall give this operation a name! It shall be known as Op--"
Kurisu: "Don’t need one. Let’s start."
Rintaro: "Wha... but..."
UNSPOKEN: You ruined my climactic scene! Damn you, assistant! This is an outrage! Afterwards, the D-Mail experiment -- its name is Operation Urd, though I lost my chance to announce it -- continues for two hours. During that time, every D-Mail goes back in time without a hitch. Now it’s time to take a break. We’re all hungry, and except for Mayuri, we’ve been up since last night.
Kurisu: "Go ahead and rest. I’m gonna have a go at it a little longer."
