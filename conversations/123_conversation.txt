UNSPOKEN: She notices me and calls out without stopping her exercises.
Suzuha: "What shenanigans are you up to this early in the morning?"
UNSPOKEN: Shenanigans? This girl has a thing for unusual words.
Rintaro: "The kind you wouldn’t believe. We’re building the first time machine in human history."
Suzuha: "Huh. Cool."
Rintaro: "Hey, shouldn’t you be more surprised!?"
Itaru: "Can’t blame her for being skeptical. I didn’t think it was possible either. And isn’t that top secret? I thought you didn’t want anyone to know."
Rintaro: "Crap! Part-Time Warrior, please keep what I just said a secret."
Suzuha: "Sure. By the way..."
UNSPOKEN: Part-Time Warrior glances at the Braun Tube Workshop.
Suzuha: "The boss is really pissed."
Rintaro: "Why?"
Suzuha: "The noise. Whatever you’re doing up there, it’s got the whole building shaking. Dust everywhere. Kinda like an air raid. He was saying stuff like ’What’s that nutcase doing? I’mma raise his damn rent!’ Maybe you should go apologize."
Itaru: "Oh boy. What if he kicks us out?"
Rintaro: "Alright, leave it to me. Daru, go tell my assistant to lay off the experiments for now."
Itaru: "Roger that... I won’t forget you, soldier."
UNSPOKEN: Daru salutes, then races up to the second floor.
Suzuha: "...By the way, is Makise Kurisu here too?"
Rintaro: "Yeah."
UNSPOKEN: Come to think of it, she did pick a fight with Christina yesterday.
Rintaro: "Have you met before?"
Suzuha: "Um... no. Yesterday was first contact."
Rintaro: "First contact?"
UNSPOKEN: That’s a strange way of putting it.
Rintaro: "Oh. Really? Weren’t you a little hostile for a first contact?"
Suzuha: "She’s... my enemy."
UNSPOKEN: What? I barely heard her, her voice was so low. I’m about to ask her to repeat herself, but Suzuha is staring at the ground in silence. She obviously doesn’t want to talk about this. Did she call Kurisu her enemy? But that doesn’t make sense.
Rintaro: "How can she be your enemy? You just met, right?"
Suzuha: "Yeah."
Rintaro: "Did she do something to you?"
Suzuha: "Not to me."
Rintaro: "What does that mean? She did something to someone else? If you want, I can go talk things over with Christina."
Suzuha: "It doesn’t really matter."
Rintaro: "Maybe you’re blaming the wrong person?"
Suzuha: "Geez! Give it a rest!"
UNSPOKEN: She hits me with a glare.
Suzuha: "Anyway! Shouldn’t you apologize to the boss instead of talking to me?"
UNSPOKEN: Heh. Actually, I’m getting cold feet. But I am Hououin Kyouma, the mad scientist who brings chaos to the world. I can’t falter now. I steel myself and enter the Braun Tube Workshop. Part-Time Warrior follows me inside.
Rintaro: "I have come!"
