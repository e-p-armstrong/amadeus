UNSPOKEN: Kurisu slurps her cup noodles indignantly. I bought them at her request. She was raised in America, yet she likes cup noodles? Strange.
Rintaro: Celebrity bath time at a high class hotel? I want to come too.
Kurisu: Not a chance.
Mayuri: Mayushii wants to come too!
Kurisu: You can come any time, Mayuri-san.
Mayuri: Really? Thank youâ™ª
UNSPOKEN: I take my warm food out of the microwave, take a fresh bottle of Dr P out of the fridge, and join in on lunch.
Mayuri: Hey, Okarin, I've been wondering, but why do you drink soda while you eat? Does it make it taste better?
Rintaro: I don't really see a problem.
Itaru: Me neither.
Kurisu: Same. I didn't give it a second thought.
Mayuri: Ehh?
Rintaro: You're acting weird, Mayuri. It's normal to drink soda while eating.
Itaru: It's normal, duh.
Kurisu: No objections.
Mayuri: No way! You guys are the weird ones!
UNSPOKEN: Well, I'm a pure Docperian, Daru loves cola like a typical fat otaku, and Kurisu lives in America, home of soda. So I admit our opinion is biased. But that doesn't matter right now.
Rintaro: Now, let's discuss Operation Urd's progress.
Itaru: Operation Urd?
Rintaro: Oh, right. Thanks to a certain assistant, I didn't get a chance to present the operation's codename yesterday. Heed me! These D-Mail experiments are all part of Operation Ur--
Kurisu: The experiments have been fruitful.
UNSPOKEN: She interrupts me again.
Kurisu: At the very least, we've learned what we can do with D-Mail.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu places her empty noodle cup on the table, then retrieves the whiteboard from the development room. While the rest of us eat, she scribbles on the whiteboard, then puts it up against the wall.
Kurisu: That about sums it up. Anything to add?
UNSPOKEN: Nothing especially. She's summarized the vital parts. Mayuri has her mouth half-open in a blank stare. She clearly doesn't understand.
Rintaro: A D-Mail can be at most 36 English characters or 18 Japanese characters long. That makes experimentation difficult, so we'll want to improve that first.
UNSPOKEN: Furthermore, each D-Mail is split into 12 character segments. If you send 36 characters, you'll get three 12-character emails. If you try to send more, everything after the 36th character disappears.
Itaru: But we figured out how to control when it arrives. That's pretty good, right?
UNSPOKEN: Though we can only set it in one hour increments, we can control how far back D-Mails go by using the microwave's timer.
Kurisu: Observation isn't enough. We need to find the underlying principle. What I've written here is nothing but verified phenomena.
Rintaro: The underlying principle... you're right. It's not a complete time machine until we understand how it works. What could be the reason for the character limit?
UNSPOKEN: Daru and Kurisu remain silent.
Mayuri: Um...
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Mayuri, who has been staring at the ceiling in confusion until now, raises her hand.
Mayuri: Chicken and bananas become 'gelchicken' and 'gelbanas', but salt doesn't turn into 'gelsalt', right?
