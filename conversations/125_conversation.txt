Rintaro: We don't know what acts as the lifter... But we do know that it has successfully created a path wide enough to send approximately 36 bytes of data through the ring singularity.
Mayuri: I don't get it...
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri, finished with her chicken, looks at us in confusion.
Rintaro: Think of it like an RPG. The ring singularity, the entrance to the event horizon, is the gate to the Demon Lord's castle.
Kurisu: D-demon Lord...?
Mayuri: So the soldiers who went home as slimes are jellymen?
Rintaro: But there's an exception.
Itaru: Combining soldiers? That's just silly.
Rintaro: It's to illustrate that the object can't be too big.
Mayuri: I get it! That's really easy to understand.
Kurisu: It is?
Itaru: It's a dumb metaphor, but I guess it works? At least as an explanation for why things get gelified.
Rintaro: Heh. It's all thanks to Mayuri's hint.
Mayuri: Mayushii was helpful?
Rintaro: Yeah. Great insight, Mayuri.
Mayuri: Ehehe! Yay!
Kurisu: But it's still a hypothesis. It hasn't been proven.
Itaru: How would you prove it? With human experiments like SERN?
Kurisu: If Okabe and Hashida-san volunteer as test subjects, I'll happily experiment on you.
Itaru: Human experimentation sounds kinda dirty. If you know what I mean. But I refuse. I'd rather play the doctor than the subject.
Rintaro: Same here. No, not in the way he's implying.
Kurisu: Idiots.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu gives us a cold stare and shrugs her shoulders in exasperation.
Kurisu: As I keep saying, the real problem is what the PhoneWave uses as a lifter.
Rintaro: That and one other thing. How come the discharge phenomenon and gelification only happen during a certain timeframe?
Itaru: We may not understand everything, but we've perfected the art of D-Mailing. Isn't that our Final Answer?
Mayuri: Sending mail to the past is amazing, isn't it?
Itaru: Though I guess it's not a real time machine unless we can send people to the past.
Kurisu: Even SERN has failed to send humans through. If you believe what Titor says, it won't be another, what, 24 years before there's a true time machine?
UNSPOKEN: I answer Kurisu's sarcastic question with a nod.
Rintaro: Physical time travel is impossible for us at the moment. We lack the funds and facilities available to SERN. And yet we have realized a form of time travel. We've sent data to the past.
Kurisu: We should investigate the PhoneWave further. We need to understand what's going on.
Itaru: I have some fun ideas for how to use D-Mail.
Rintaro: I know how you feel, but we can't today. If we shake the building again, Mister Braun is sure to blow a gasket.
UNSPOKEN: He'll raise the rent or kick us out of the lab.
Rintaro: We can start experimenting again tomorrow. But this, I will declare now.
UNSPOKEN: I step onto the couch and look at each lab mem in turn.
Mayuri: You have to take off your shoes. It's dirty!
Rintaro: Today -- uhh, what day is it?
Itaru: August 2nd.
Rintaro: August 2nd, 2010 is a date which will live in infamy! For on this day, we, the Future Gadget Laboratory, have developed-- The first successful time machine in the history of mankind!
