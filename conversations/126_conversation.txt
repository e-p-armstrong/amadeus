Kurisu: And you can't even say we developed it. It happened by accident.
Rintaro: Hmph! It seems that my assistant doesn't know the meaning of the word 'serendipity'. Penicillin, X-ray machines, dynamite -- these inventions and more were all born from coincidence!
Kurisu: I guess...
Mayuri: But Chris-chan, you said before that time machines don't exist, right? But now you admit they do!
Kurisu: It's just that I have to admit it for now. If we investigate how the PhoneWave works, it might turn out to be something that only seems like time travel.
Rintaro: Does nobody have any respect for my grand declaration!? Don't complain if I take all the credit for inventing the first -- second, whatever -- time machine in human history! The 66th Round Table Conference ends here. Dismissed!
Itaru: Wait, that was a Round Table Conference? I didn't know that. And it's even the 66th.
Kurisu: Who cares what kind of table it is?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu gets up from her chair and stretches.
Kurisu: I'm gonna go back to my hotel, take a shower, and sleep.
Mayuri: Mayushii has to go to work soon.
