Itaru: Hey, Okarin. Did you... do something to her?
Rintaro: Like what? We were just taking pictures.
Itaru: Pictures... pictures? So you're going to blackmail her and force her to be our sex toy...
Rintaro: Stop applying eroge logic to reality.
Itaru: My bad.
UNSPOKEN: Daru's jokes aren't helping.
Itaru: Oh, right. I thought up some upgrades we could make to the PhoneWave.
Rintaro: Like what?
Itaru: You know how it's a huge pain in the ass to send D-Mails to the past?
Rintaro: Yeah.
Itaru: I want to simplify that process. Oh, and also make it possible to forward from the PhoneWave's dedicated phone.
Rintaro: Forward? What do you mean?
Itaru: Right now, you can only send a D-Mail to the phone attached to the PhoneWave, right?
UNSPOKEN: That's right. In yesterday's experiments, my phone was attached to the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s socket, so my inbox got flooded with D-Mails.
Itaru: That's pretty inconvenient. If we give the PhoneWave's dedicated phone a forwarding function, we can use it to send D-Mails to any number we want.
Rintaro: How long will that upgrade take?
Itaru: Two or three hours? That's if you help me, though.
Rintaro: Understood. I'll help.
Itaru: OK.
UNSPOKEN: Daru really is reliable. I walk up to him with my hand raised for a high five. But he completely ignores it, sits on the sofa, and begins eating. Dammit! Pay attention, Daru! I slowly lower my hand. W-whatever. Once the upgrades are complete, we'll gather the lab mems and begin discussing serious D-Mail use. It's time to think about the practical applications of sending mail to the past. Another mail? I could ignore it, but the ringtone keeps demanding my attention. This is far more irritating than normal conversation. But maybe that's the point. Normally, Moeka just kind of fades into the background. This could be her way of forcing people to pay attention to her. Daru, you idiot! How could you make such a basic mistake!? Moeka, whose eyes have never once left her phone, is now staring straight at me. I ignore the ringtone and go back to the development room.
Rintaro: If you want to say something, then say it to my--
UNSPOKEN: I lose my breath mid-sentence. Moeka is staring straight at me. Moeka, whose eyes never leave her phone.
Moeka: ...Read the email.
UNSPOKEN: Her serious tone gives me pause.
Rintaro: Say it to my--
Moeka: Sending email to the past.
Rintaro: ...!
