UNSPOKEN: Moeka's pretty persistent. I know that because of her mail attacks. She won't let me escape so easily. What should I do!? In frustration, I put my phone to my ear.
Rintaro: It's me. There's a problem. ...No, not that. Information on Number 8 got leaked to a third party. ...Yeah, I know. I need to do something. Depending on the situation, I may have to silence her. ...Yeah, I know. We can't let the Organization know about this. Steins Gate seems to enjoy sending trouble my way. ...Heh, don't worry. My seat in hell can wait until Ragnarok is over. El Psy Kongroo.
UNSPOKEN: I put my phone in my pocket and turn back to Moeka.
Moeka: ...Who was that?
Rintaro: It doesn't concern you.
UNSPOKEN: Moeka looks down and begins typing another mail. What the hell does that mean? Since she didn't include her usual signature, does that mean she was in a hurry? Her expression didn't change at all, though. Anyway, I disregard the mail's contents and take one step towards Moeka. She makes no attempt to escape. I'm standing between her and the door.
Rintaro: Kiryu Moeka. You must swear to protect our secret... or die. Choose now. No time to think it over. No alternatives either. You have learned our secret, and now you must pay the price.
Moeka: ...You'll kill me?
Rintaro: Only if you try to go public. Underestimate the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, at your per--
Itaru: Are you at it again, Okarin?
UNSPOKEN: Daru's standing behind me. I turn around in surprise.
Itaru: Kiryu-shi, was it? Okarin's kind of crazy, so it's ok to ignore him when he talks like this.
UNSPOKEN: Can't you see what's going on, Super Hacka!?
Rintaro: Imbecile! Because of your careless tongue, she found out that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is a time machine!
Moeka: A... time machine!
Itaru: Uh, that was pretty careless too.
Rintaro: Guh...
UNSPOKEN: This is awful. Everything that could go wrong, has. How do I recover!? First, I need to silence Moe--
Mayuri: Tutturuâ™ª Good morning! Okarin! Mayushii wants to warm up some chicken before you start the time travel experiments.
UNSPOKEN: I drop to my knees in utter despair. We're finished. It's impossible to talk our way out of this one.
Rintaro: Kiryu Moeka. I'll tell you everything... and I have a favor to ask. Tremble, right arm of mine! By the covenant I command thee. Come forth, hellfire of darkest black! Fulfill my desire for ultimate destruction. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust! Hrraahm!!
UNSPOKEN: I pull hard with both my arms, tearing the microwave door free with a terrible screech. The screws were loosened, but it sounds like I might have broken something too. Well, whatever.
Mayuri: Ahhh! Now I can't warm up any more chicken...
