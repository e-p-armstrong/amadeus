Rintaro: "I can’t tell you. I swore a blood oath to maintain secrecy and protect the original owner from those who desire the IBN 5100."
UNSPOKEN: I mean, anything could happen. Moeka might seduce Luka’s dad, for instance, and get him to lend her the IBN 5100. And then I couldn’t complain if Moeka took it away. I must avoid that situation at all costs. Of course, I don’t think Moeka can seduce anyone with her personality. And since Luka’s dad has a wife and kids, I don’t think he’d fall easily either. I’m probably just thinking too much. Moeka, meanwhile, is staring at the floor in what I assume is defeat.
Rintaro: "...I am not without sympathy for your plight. I formed a contract with the IBN 5100 for my own goals. After I achieve those goals, you can negotiate with the original owner to form a contract of your own."
UNSPOKEN: When I return the IBN 5100 to Yanabayashi Shrine, Ragnarok will be over, and the fate of the world will have already been decided.
Rintaro: "And when Ragnarok is over, whether it ends in victory or defeat, my life as Hououin Kyouma will be... No, forget what I said. This is no time to be thinking about the future. After all, my future is already..."
Moeka: "Anyway... where was it?"
UNSPOKEN: Geez, I had some good angst going there. She’s just oblivious to the mood.
Rintaro: "The IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine."
UNSPOKEN: Just then, I hear the sound of the door opening. Moeka twitches. I look into the lounge and see Daru, wiping the sweat off his brow with a towel as he comes in.
Itaru: "...Guten Morgen."
Rintaro: "You sure are early."
UNSPOKEN: Ever since university went into summer break, Daru has been coming to the lab in the morning less and less. But then again, he’s also been staying up all night more and more.
Itaru: "I went to bed early. Woke up at five this morning. Man, it’s hot! It’s not supposed to be this hot in the morning. Oh? Oh? Okarin, who’s this erot... sexy 3D woman?"
Rintaro: "Ah, let me introduce you. This is Shining Finger, Kiryu Moeka."
Itaru: "Shining... Finger? Does her hand glow with an awesome power?"
Rintaro: "No, but she’s definitely an esper."
Itaru: "An esper? That’s stupid."
Rintaro: "Watch her type. You’ll see."
Itaru: "Well, whatever. Welcome to the lab, Kiryu-shi."
UNSPOKEN: Even though Daru bowed his head, Moeka doesn’t so much as look at him. She’s now looking down at her phone -- not that she ever really looked away. Daru turns red.
Itaru: "Wh-what magnificent ignore skill. Are you looking down on me because I’m a fatass ota? You’re a mainstream woman, aren’t you!?"
