UNSPOKEN: Moeka slowly raises her gun. She points the muzzle at... Mayuri. My whole body instantly goes cold.
Moeka: Shiina Mayuri is not needed.
Rintaro: Stop!
UNSPOKEN: I lunge at Moeka, but the dark-skinned man is faster.
Rintaro: Gah!
UNSPOKEN: Something strikes my chin with crushing force. The shock numbs my entire body. Stars explode behind my eyes. I fall to my knees, powerless to stand. Everything goes dark. What happened? Did he hit me with the butt of his rifle?
Mayuri: Okarin!
UNSPOKEN: I look up. Mayuri, face streaked with tears, is reaching out to me as if begging for help. Over her shoulder, I see Moeka ready her gun.
Kurisu: Mayuri! No!
UNSPOKEN: I try to yell Stop! but my voice catches in my throat. Nothing comes out but a pitiful wheeze. Someone. Anyone. Please. Stop her. Stop Moeka! Moeka's lips move. She's mumbling something.
Moeka: For SERN... for FB... for SERN... for FB...
UNSPOKEN: Her mouth opens and closes robotically. My blood curdles.  No! A sharp, dry crack splits the air. Time slows to a crawl. Moeka pulled the trigger. Blood spurts from Mayuri's forehead. It splashes across my face, wet and warm. Her delicate, frail body falls towards me. I catch her. Her body is limp, like a puppet with no strings. Her head and arms dangle lifelessly. The smell of gunpowder fills my nose. And then, the smell of blood.
Itaru: Wahhhhhhhhhhh!
UNSPOKEN: Daru clutches his head and falls to his knees, screaming at the top of his lungs. The sound jerks me back to my senses. In my arms, Mayuri takes one short, shallow breath. And then...
Mayuri: O...kari...
Rintaro: ...Mayuri?
Kurisu: No... no!
UNSPOKEN: She's dead. Mayuri's dead. Her face is covered in blood. Her blood stains my hands. It's warm.
Moeka: You three come with us. Now. No more warnings. Resist, and we'll kill you too.
UNSPOKEN: I hear a voice. But I can't comprehend what it's saying. What is this? What's going on here? Is this a joke? This is a dream, right? ...Right? I feel nothing. My mind is blank. I shake Mayuri's shoulder. Mayuri? Wake up, Mayuri. You'll catch cold if you sleep here. If you're tired, you can stay overnight. Or I can take you home, if you prefer. We'll ride the train back to Ikebukuro together, like we used to before Daru joined, when it was just the two of us. Memories of her smile whirl through my head, a thousand different smiles from a thousand different occasions. If I look away, she'll disappear. She always disappears. No, Mayuri. I still need you. Laugh for me - ehehe - like you always do. Greet me with your silly tutturuâ™ª. Tell me it's a lie. Tell me you're alright. ...[linebreak]...[linebreak]Mayuri?
Rintaro: Ah... AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
UNSPOKEN: Red flames consume my mind, an inferno of rage and hate and rage and hate and the burning desire to kill everything I see. I gently lay the motionless Mayuri on the floor. I stand up. And then I fling myself at Moeka.
Kurisu: Okabe!
UNSPOKEN: But before I can take a step, someone grabs my hand from behind.
Kurisu: You can't!
Rintaro: Let me go! Let me go!
Kurisu: You can't! They'll kill you!
UNSPOKEN: Moeka's gun is aimed at my head. Her finger is already on the trigger.
Rintaro: You gonna kill me too!?
Moeka: If you resist.
Kurisu: Please, Okabe, do what she says. Okay? Otherwise, they'll kill you too.
