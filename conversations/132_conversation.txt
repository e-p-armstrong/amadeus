UNSPOKEN: Moeka just keeps staring at my phone.
Suzuha: Hey!
UNSPOKEN: Part-Time Warrior's voice comes from outside the window.
Suzuha: It's shaking again! And there's a strange light, too! What are you doing up there!?
UNSPOKEN: I decide to ignore her. Mister Braun is one thing, but she doesn't scare me at all.
Rintaro: Now then, lab mems.
UNSPOKEN: I assemble all the lab members, including Moeka, for a meeting.
Rintaro: The 73rd Round Table Conference will come to order.
Kurisu: Yesterday was the 66th. Where'd the other six go?
Rintaro: Only anal retentive bastards care about the minor details. That's why you'll never be more than an assistant, Christina!
Kurisu: Like I keep saying, I'm neither your assistant nor Christina.
UNSPOKEN: I ignore Kurisu's complaints and proceed.
Rintaro: In the first stage of Operation Urd, we tested the limits of D-Mail technology.
UNSPOKEN: We discovered that we could only send up to 36 English characters.
Rintaro: Today, we advance to the second stage. Practical applications of D-Mail.
Mayuri: Practical applications? I'll send one to this morning so I can say 'Good morning, Okarinâ™ª'
Rintaro: Like hell you will. Write that on the back of a leaflet or something.
Mayuri: But if it's on the back of a leaflet, you won't get it.
Rintaro: When I say practical applications, what I mean is...
UNSPOKEN: I take a short pause to look at all four members. Then I lower my voice.
Rintaro: Changing the past.
UNSPOKEN: Shock ripples through the room.
Kurisu: Now hold on! It's too dangerous! Are you trying to play god!?
Rintaro: Oh? What's so dangerous about it?
Kurisu: Let's say you create a time paradox and blow up the world. What do you plan to do then?
Rintaro: Well, I guess we'd be dead.
Kurisu: You're going to change the past so recklessly? Are you kidding me? Don't tell me... you're not seriously trying to bring chaos to the world or whatever, are you?
Itaru: Nah, he's all talk. It's fine to ignore him, Makise-shi.
Kurisu: R-really?
Mayuri: Don't worry! Okarin's actually a very nice person. You'll see!
Rintaro: I don't remember asking for an appraisal, but I'll answer Christina's question. My dream is to plunge the world into chaos. However, it is still far too early to bring that dream to fruition. We can only send 36-byte emails. That's not enough for my purposes. Therefore, I shall set my ambition -- Project Chaotic -- aside for now.
Moeka: Project... Chaotic?
Kurisu: Did you just come up with that?
Itaru: Correct, Makise-shi!
Kurisu: YES.
Itaru: Okarin just says the first thing that comes to mind. He's always like that.
Rintaro: Don't analyze me, Daru! And you, assistant! Stop that fist pumping! You making fun of me!?
Mayuri: Um, so what are we going to do?
Itaru: Yeah. How do you want to change the past, anyway?
Rintaro: First of all, the purpose of this experiment is to verify whether or not we can actually change the past. So it doesn't matter how trivial the change is.
