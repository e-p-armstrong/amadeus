UNSPOKEN: Moeka nods.
Itaru: "Alright, program complete."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu, lying on the sofa, looks up from the technical manual she was reading. She got here about thirty minutes ago.
Kurisu: "Then lets resume the experiments."
Mayuri: "But won’t the manager scold us again?"
Rintaro: "Heh, don’t worry. Yesterday, I made this promise with Mister Braun. ’I swear there won’t be any more shaking today.’ In other words, the no-shaking promise only applied yesterday, so since today is yesterday’s tomorrow, we can shake it all we want!"
Kurisu: "That doesn’t settle anything. Why you’re so confident is a mystery to me."
Rintaro: "In other words, Christina, you want me to erase Mister Braun."
Kurisu: "No! Besides, I don’t think a wimp like you stands a chance against him."
Mayuri: "He’s so muscley!"
UNSPOKEN: Unfortunately, it’s impossible to experiment without shaking the building. I have no choice but to negotiate with Mister Braun somehow. The other four members look at me in anticipation. Are they planning to sacrifice me!?
Rintaro: "Is this the choice of Steins Gate? But how do I..."
UNSPOKEN: While trying to think of a way to avoid talking to the manager, I wander over to the window and look outside.
Rintaro: "Hm?"
UNSPOKEN: The street below is mostly empty. A girl is polishing her bicycle in front of the building. A much younger girl is squatting next to her, watching her work. They’re alone. I can only see the backs of their heads from here, but I know who they are.
Rintaro: "Hey you! Part-Time Warrior!"
UNSPOKEN: When I call her, Suzuha looks left and right while wiping the sweat off her brow before finally looking up here.
Suzuha: "Sup!"
UNSPOKEN: The girl beside her also looks up. This cute little girl is Tennouji Nae, Mister Braun’s only daughter. Looks like she came to play with her father today. I’ve always wondered how it’s possible for such a muscular man to spawn such a cute girl. Nae bows her head when we make eye contact. I return the nod, then call out to Suzuha.
Rintaro: "What are you doing there?"
Suzuha: "Can’t you tell? I’m polishing my bicycle!"
Rintaro: "Aren’t you working today?"
Suzuha: "Of course I am. Why else would I be here?"
UNSPOKEN: You’re polishing your bicycle even though you’re at work? I mean, I guess the store barely has any customers. To put it bluntly, was there even a need for a part timer?
Kurisu: "What, is she still tinkering with that bike of hers?"
UNSPOKEN: I can hear Kurisu’s sour voice from inside the lab.
Kurisu: "She was there when I came in, glaring at me."
UNSPOKEN: Looks like they’re still fighting.
Rintaro: "Hey, Part-Time Warrior! Where’s Mister Braun?"
Suzuha: "Mister Braun? Who’s that?"
Rintaro: "The manager of that junk shop you work at."
Kurisu: "It’s not a junk shop. It’s a CRT specialty shop."
