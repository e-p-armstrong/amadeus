Rintaro: Of course.
Itaru: Yeah, it's like that saying. 'When the wind blows, the bucket maker gains.'
Kurisu: Eh? No, it's kinda like that, but kinda not...
Rintaro: A butterfly flaps its wings in Beijing and a storm happens in New York, right?
Kurisu: Yeah, that. Part of Chaos Theory. Basically, any change, no matter how small, could have a significant effect on the future. How do you plan to take responsibility for that?
Rintaro: Titor said that the many-worlds interpretation holds true.
Kurisu: And that makes it okay to change the past? You're going to believe that self-proclaimed time traveler's delusions?
Rintaro: Can you prove they're delusions?
Kurisu: I'm asking what you're going to do if they are. How are you going to deal with the consequences?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu and I glare at each other. For some reason, I always end up getting emotional whenever I argue with this impertinent assistant of mine. Such weakness is unbefitting of an insane mad scientist. I need to calm down.
Rintaro: Christina, you said this before, did you not? When hypotheses pile up, and theories are verified, they become reality. That's how modern physics comes to understand the truth of the universe. You're contradicting yourself.
Kurisu: No, I'm not. We don't even have a hypothesis for how the PhoneWave works. We're just fumbling around in the dark here. There are still too many risks to try changing the past. We should wait until we know more.
UNSPOKEN: Oh? So she's not unconditionally opposed?
Rintaro: You're actually itching to try it out, aren't you?
Kurisu: W-well...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu quickly looks away.
Rintaro: Besides, didn't you want to prove that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) isn't a time machine? If it's not a time machine, then it can't change the past. You could prove yourself right, so why are you against it?
Kurisu: Oh shut up...
Rintaro: And if you're going to talk about time paradoxes, then what about SERN? They've already sent more than 100 people to the past. Surely a few paradoxes have happened by now.
Kurisu: So you want to stoop to the same level as the guys that did those inhumane experiments?
Rintaro: We're not doing human testing or anything, so relax.
Mayuri: Um...
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Mayuri raises her hand. She was staring blankly at us this whole time, so I'm a bit surprised.
Mayuri: Um, Okarin? Mayushii doesn't really get it, but what are you going to change?
UNSPOKEN: Finally, some constructive conversation.
Rintaro: My goal for this operation is simple. We, my friends... Are going to win the lottery!
UNSPOKEN: Everyone except for Moeka stares at me openmouthed.
Itaru: I'm for it. If we win the lottery, I can buy all the computer parts I want and go to MayQueen for every meal of the day. We'd be stupid not to try it.
UNSPOKEN: That's my super hacka!
Mayuri: Money? Okarin... that makes Mayushii sad. We should do something that will bring peace to the world! Like what if we give everybody in the whole wide world an Upa cushion?
