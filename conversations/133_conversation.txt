UNSPOKEN: The little girl diligently corrects us on her father’s name. She must not get the joke.
Suzuha: "The boss is on a service trip! I don’t think he’ll be back for a while!"
Rintaro: "Wh-what!? Is that true!?"
Suzuha: "It’s true! I wouldn’t be slacking off like this otherwise! Ah, Nae, don’t tell the boss I said that, okay?"
Nae: "Then let me ride your bicycle."
UNSPOKEN: It’s a blessing from the gods! I give my gratitude to Part-Time Warrior and shift my attention back inside.
Rintaro: "You heard her. This must be the choice of Steins Gate. Mister Braun is currently absent. In other words, we can experiment to our heart’s content!"
Kurisu: "That doesn’t solve the problem, you know."
Rintaro: "I’m telling you, it’s the choice of Steins Gate."
Itaru: "Whatever. I want to try out the PhoneWave 2nd Edition v1. 03."
Mayuri: "Second attention verse erosion?"
Itaru: "2nd Edition v1. 03."
UNSPOKEN: How did we get to 1. 03?
Rintaro: "Enough of your unsophisticated names. The upgraded version shall be known as Heavenly Merry-Go-Round."
Kurisu: "The name doesn’t matter. Let’s just start the experi--"
UNSPOKEN: The sound of a camera interrupts our quarrel. Moeka has her phone pointed at us. How many times have I told her not to take pictures!?
Moeka: "...You looked like you were having fun."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri smiles happily. Daru doesn’t react. Kurisu turns away in a huff.
Kurisu: "Hardly. I’m fed up with these people and their fooling around."
Itaru: "This assistant is such a tsundere."
Kurisu: "Who are you calling a tsundere!?"
Itaru: "Oh? Makise-shi, you know what tsundere means?"
Kurisu: "...N-no."
Rintaro: "I think you do. It’s written all over your face."
Kurisu: "Mmmgh..."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu bites her lip. So she is familiar with otaku culture. I wonder how she got that knowledge while living in America.
Moeka: "...Experiment please."
UNSPOKEN: Moeka’s tired of waiting. She’s shown great interest in the time machine ever since we told her the truth. Of course, I made her promise never to write an article about it. I threatened to take her phone away if she breaks her oath. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is ready to send a D-Mail whenever we are.
Itaru: "I’m setting it up so it forwards to Okarin’s phone."
