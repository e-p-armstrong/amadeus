Kurisu: What?
Rintaro: Don't you get it!? I'm being chased by the Organization. If we win 1st prize, the media will cover the event and my cover will be blown!
Kurisu: That's stupid.
Mayuri: What if Mayushii wins?
Rintaro: No. Stage Two of Operation Urd does have its risks, just like Celeb Sev said.
Kurisu: Celeb... Sev? Don't abbreviate it.
Rintaro: I'll be the winner. That way, I shoulder all of the risk.
Kurisu: And all of the money, right? I see your plan.
UNSPOKEN: I ignore Celeb Sev's remark. The prospect of pocketing 200 million yen is certainly appetizing, but that would be too big a change to the past.  Just like Celeb Sev said, we can't ignore the Butterfly Effect. We should flap our wings as softly as possible. I'm not scared or anything. Really.
Rintaro: Anyway, we should aim a little lower. Daru, how much is 2nd prize?
Itaru: Umm, looks like it was... 23 million yen.
Rintaro: ...L-let's try 3rd prize.
Itaru: That was only 700, 000 yen.
Rintaro: Yeah, that's good. That should be about right.
Kurisu: You're such a chicken.
Rintaro: Heh, heh heh heh! That's rich, coming from the one who was so worried about the risk of time paradoxes. Eh, Celeb Sev!?
Kurisu: I'm begging you, stop calling me that. I'll settle for assistant. And don't misunderstand. I'm still worried about what could go wrong.
Rintaro: I'm trying to minimize our risk by choosing an amount that's just right. Stop being so stubborn.
Kurisu: ...No, you.
UNSPOKEN: I decide to let Celeb Sev have the last word.
Mayuri: Um, could we fill a truckload of bananas with 700, 000 yen?
UNSPOKEN: Nobody said anything about using the entire dividend on bananas, but it looks like Mayuri intends to do so. Let's ignore the glutton for now.
Itaru: For 3rd prize, you need to get five matching numbers.
UNSPOKEN: Last week's six winning numbers were 02, 12, 19, 34, 35, and 40. The bonus number was 08. 1st prize is for matching all six numbers. 2nd prize is for matching five numbers plus the bonus number. 3rd prize is for matching only five numbers.
Rintaro: Moeka. I assign to you your first duty as a new lab mem.
Moeka: Eh...?
UNSPOKEN: Moeka stares at me. She clearly didn't expect her name to be called.
Rintaro: Figure out what to put in the D-Mail. It needs to convince an unknowing me one week ago to buy into the LOTO SIX.
Moeka: ...Me?
Rintaro: You are the mail demon, so this should be right up your alley.
UNSPOKEN: Moeka doesn't seem that interested, but she nods. We set the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to forward to my phone.
Kurisu: Thursday last week... so about five days. Is that okay?
