Itaru: The drawing was five days ago. It needs to arrive before that, right?
Kurisu: We'll send it to one week ago. 7 days is 168 hours, so let's round up a bit and enter 170#.
Mayuri: Ummm, 1, 7, 0, #...
UNSPOKEN: Moeka has finished typing the email into my phone. We replaced the number 40 with 37. This way, we won't get 1st or 2nd prize.
Rintaro: It'll have to do.
UNSPOKEN: We can only send 36 bytes. There's only so much we can say.
Mayuri: This mail's kinda shady, huh? Ehehe!
Moeka: ...I'll redo it.
UNSPOKEN: I stop Moeka from erasing the mail.
Rintaro: It's fine. I don't think there's any other way. Though it is kind of shady.
Mayuri: Don't worry! Okarin loves shady things, so it's perfect!
UNSPOKEN: That's not entirely incorrect, but it feels like she's making fun of me. In any case, our preparations are complete. It's hard to believe that this is all it takes to send emails to the past.
Rintaro: The time has come. Prepare to open Steins Gate!
Kurisu: It's been bugging me, but what is that Steins Gate thing?
Mayuri: It's Okarin's catch phraseâ™ª
Rintaro: Steins Gate is Steins Gate. Nothing more, nothing less.
Kurisu: That doesn't explain anything.
Rintaro: Don't complain about every little thing. That's not important right now.
UNSPOKEN: I place my finger on the send button. My hands are shaking. I fight to keep them steady.
Itaru: Starting up the microwave!
UNSPOKEN: I swallow hard. The turntable begins to spin backwards as the microwave comes to life. The timer ticks down. 163... 162... 161... Change the past. It seems very simple to do. But just like Kurisu said, there's no telling what might happen. I said I'd take responsibility, but that was just talk. If a time paradox does occur, it could do irreparable damage to the world I know. 150... 149... 148... How am I supposed to take responsibility for that? Lightning crackles in the air around us. It's working. All I need to do is press the send button. 136... 135... 134... I can't stop now. I want to see what lies beyond. Curiosity pushes me forward. There's no way this will destroy the world. There's no way. 122... 121... 120...
Rintaro: El Psy Kongroo!
UNSPOKEN: I press the button. My phone displays a flying mail animation and the words Sending mail. 116... 115... A wave of vertigo washes over me. It feels as if my feet have left the ground. Suddenly, my vision blurs, and everything turns monochrome. Is the ground shaking? Every cell in my body is screaming, This is wrong!
Mayuri: Okarin? Are you okay?
Rintaro: ...!
