UNSPOKEN: Silence descends upon us. Kurisu and Mayuri are still thinking, but I doubt they’ll come up with anything good. As for Moeka, I can’t tell what she’s thinking, or if she’s even thinking at all. She’s just staring at her phone, motionless. She’s not even typing for a change. Daru has already declared his support for me. Now he’s browsing moe news sites as if this whole thing doesn’t concern him.
Rintaro: "Even with a time machine before you all, this is all you can think of. You guys sure lack imagination. If there are no other suggestions, we’ll use my plan."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu frowns, but she doesn’t raise any more complaints. As I thought. She, too, wants to know if we can change the past. She’s a scientist through and through. And if I’m not mistaken, she has a bit of mad in her too! Muhahaha! I take out my phone and put it to my ear.
Rintaro: "It’s me. We’re beginning stage two of Operation Urd. Yeah, no problem. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall take all responsibility. Heh, don’t worry. Nothing will come back to you. Correct. This is my choice, and the choice of Steins Gate. Ragnarok is near. El Psy Kongroo."
UNSPOKEN: I put my phone away and look at my lab mems.
Rintaro: "Now, begin the operation!"
UNSPOKEN: Nobody moves a muscle. They just look at each other.
Itaru: "Uh, what do you want us to do?"
Rintaro: "Are you incapable of doing anything without my instructions?"
Mayuri: "First, we need to buy a lottery ticket."
Kurisu: "No, first we need a winning number."
Rintaro: "Exactly, Celeb Seventeen! Now you’re talking."
Kurisu: "Don’t call me Celeb Seventeen."
Itaru: "First, we have to decide which lottery to go for. Think we should go for Dream Summer Jumbo?"
Mayuri: "I saw a TV commercial for that the other day!"
Rintaro: "Did they announce the winners?"
Itaru: "Should be next week or the week after."
Rintaro: "Then there’s no point! We can only send D-Mails to the past!"
Itaru: "Oh, right. We could wait until the Summer Jumbo drawing date."
Rintaro: "You’ve got your priorities backwards. Don’t get fixated on Summer Jumbo. Let’s look at the last lottery that announced its winners."
Itaru: "Hmmm, I’ll google it."
UNSPOKEN: Daru starts searching on his computer. Meanwhile, Kurisu is thinking hard.
Kurisu: "If someone sent me the winning numbers from the future, would I believe it?"
Mayuri: "Um, Mayushii doesn’t even know how to buy a lottery ticket..."
Kurisu: "That’s okay. I don’t think teenage girls buy lottery tickets."
Rintaro: "Have you ever bought one, Moeka?"
UNSPOKEN: When I call out to Moeka, standing alone in the corner of the room, her shoulders twitch. Then she shakes her head a little bit.
Mayuri: "How about you, Okarin?"
Rintaro: "...I tried the LOTO SIX once."
