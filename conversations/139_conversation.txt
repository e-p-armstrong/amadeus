UNSPOKEN: Talking to Kurisu lets me sort out everything I've done. Everything I've seen.
Rintaro: I shouldn't have told Daru to hack SERN. I shouldn't have asked you to build a time machine. I shouldn't have made Moeka a lab mem. Mayuri's death... is all my fault.
UNSPOKEN: That's why I needed to bear the burden myself.  I was resolved to do whatever it took to save Mayuri, never faltering, never giving up. And yet, my resolve has already crumbled.
Kurisu: If you know that Mayuri's going to die, then what are you doing wasting time here?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's tone is haughty. Is this how I sound when I'm playing Hououin Kyouma?
Rintaro: ...I just don't get it anymore.
Kurisu: What don't you get?
Rintaro: How to save Mayuri.
Kurisu: Based on what you said, I guess the chronology protection conjecture is true.
Rintaro: No matter what I do, Mayuri dies.
Kurisu: And that's why you keep time leaping... There's no guarantee that the machine is safe, you know.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu lowers her gaze and cups her chin, as she often does when assessing a problem.
Kurisu: Even if the machine works perfectly, repeated use may have serious side effects. For example, you may become disconnected from causality itself. You need to understand the risks if you're going to continue.
Rintaro: Disconnected from causality, meaning?
Kurisu: It happens all the time in sci-fi. You'll become trapped in a closed time loop, never aging, never dying, but doomed to repeat the same day for all eternity. Worst case, you may cease to exist entirely.
UNSPOKEN: What?
Kurisu: Every trace of your existence will vanish. Nobody will remember you, because your life will have never happened. Leaping through time is that dangerous.
Rintaro: 'Humans are temporal beings.'
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks surprised.
Kurisu: Heidegger. I was thinking of that quote too.
Rintaro: I heard it from you first.
Kurisu: When?
Rintaro: This isn't the first time I've leaped.
Kurisu: Right. Of course.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu squats next to me, thinking deeply.
Kurisu: If what you said is true, then I want to save Mayuri too. But as the co-creator of the Time Leap Machine, I can't recommend its continued use. Will you listen to my advice?
Rintaro: I...
UNSPOKEN: I can't do it alone. I know that now.
Rintaro: I need your help. I have to save Mayuri! I can't do it alone, but together, we might have a chance. I want... I need to believe that! Please, lend me your strength.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu sighs.
Kurisu: You're such a stubborn fool. What you've been through... I'm surprised it hasn't broken you already.
UNSPOKEN: Incredibly, she sounds concerned about me. She looks at me for a moment, then turns away as if embarrassed.
Kurisu: I'll help. Mayuri's my friend, and a fellow lab mem. And besides... I don't want to see you in such pain.
Rintaro: I'm sorry.
Kurisu: Don't apologize. Remember when I told you about my father? You really helped me out back then. Now it's my turn to return the favor. I want to be your strength. Besides, you still have to come with me to Aomori.
UNSPOKEN: She smiles a wry but gentle smile, as if I were her mischievous younger brother.
Kurisu: I know you're going to leap no matter what I say. You are a mad scientist, after all, and mad scientists play by their own rules. Hey. Aren't you supposed to go 'muhahahaha' or something?
Rintaro: Yeah...
Kurisu: Why do I even try?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu is right. I'll do anything to save Mayuri.
Kurisu: Anyway, I'm not doing this for you, okay? I'm doing it for Mayuri.
Rintaro: Yeah, of course.
Kurisu: That, and I think you'll make a good test subject.
Rintaro: Now you're talking like SERN.
Kurisu: It's completely different.
Rintaro: How so?
Kurisu: I only experiment on you. Besides, mad scientists experiment on themselves all the time, don't they?
