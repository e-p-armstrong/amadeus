UNSPOKEN: Moeka stares at me. She clearly didn’t expect her name to be called.
Rintaro: "Figure out what to put in the D-Mail. It needs to convince an unknowing me one week ago to buy into the LOTO SIX."
Moeka: "...Me?"
Rintaro: "You are the mail demon, so this should be right up your alley."
UNSPOKEN: Moeka doesn’t seem that interested, but she nods. We set the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to forward to my phone.
Kurisu: "Thursday last week... so about five days. Is that okay?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu puts on her lab coat before checking the phone attached to the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Itaru: "The drawing was five days ago. It needs to arrive before that, right?"
Kurisu: "We’ll send it to one week ago. 7 days is 168 hours, so let’s round up a bit and enter 170#."
Mayuri: "Ummm, 1, 7, 0, #..."
UNSPOKEN: Moeka has finished typing the email into my phone. We replaced the number 40 with 37. This way, we won’t get 1st or 2nd prize.
Rintaro: "It’ll have to do."
UNSPOKEN: We can only send 36 bytes. There’s only so much we can say.
Mayuri: "This mail’s kinda shady, huh? Ehehe!"
Moeka: "...I’ll redo it."
UNSPOKEN: I stop Moeka from erasing the mail.
Rintaro: "It’s fine. I don’t think there’s any other way. Though it is kind of shady."
Mayuri: "Don’t worry! Okarin loves shady things, so it’s perfect!"
UNSPOKEN: That’s not entirely incorrect, but it feels like she’s making fun of me. In any case, our preparations are complete. It’s hard to believe that this is all it takes to send emails to the past.
Rintaro: "The time has come. Prepare to open Steins Gate!"
Kurisu: "It’s been bugging me, but what is that Steins Gate thing?"
Mayuri: "It’s Okarin’s catch phrase♪"
Rintaro: "Steins Gate is Steins Gate. Nothing more, nothing less."
Kurisu: "That doesn’t explain anything."
Rintaro: "Don’t complain about every little thing. That’s not important right now."
UNSPOKEN: I place my finger on the send button. My hands are shaking. I fight to keep them steady.
Itaru: "Starting up the microwave!"
