UNSPOKEN: Daru's eyes light up.
Itaru: That's brilliant, man! We can use D-Mails to make ourselves billionaires! I could buy all the computer parts I want and go to MayQueen for every meal of the day! I AM SO PUMPED UP!
UNSPOKEN: ...This is wrong.
Rintaro: Mayuri, you were gonna buy a truckload of bananas... right?
Mayuri: A truckload? Who's gonna fill it up?
UNSPOKEN: ...This is wrong. I look at Moeka. She's staring at the floor like usual, but I don't miss the confused glance she throws my way.
Rintaro: Wait! What happened to stage two of Operation Urd!?
Kurisu: By stage two, you mean an experiment to see if we can change the past, right?
Rintaro: R-right! That's it!
Itaru: Yeah, that's why we're all thinking.
Rintaro: What?
Mayuri: About what to send, so we can tell if the past has changed.
Itaru: I think we should definitely go with Okarin's LOTO SIX idea.
Mayuri: Mayushii thinks we shouldn't be so greedy for dough. Ah, but when I say dough, I don't mean like for baking.
Kurisu: I think we all know what you mean.
Mayuri: Really? That's great! So, instead of being greedy, we should do something that will bring peace to the world! Like, if we gave everybody in the whole wide world an Upa cushion, I think everyone would be happy♪
Itaru: The only ones who'd be happy are little kids and Mayu-shi.
UNSPOKEN: What? What are these guys saying? They're acting like I never sent that D-Mail with the winning numbers.
Luka: Um... hello?
UNSPOKEN: The front door opens slowly, and Lukako sticks his head inside.
Mayuri: Ah, it's Luka-kun! Welcome♪
Luka: Pardon the sudden intrusion...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako bows his head apologetically. Mayuri, Kurisu, and Daru go into welcome mode. Moeka... keeps staring at her phone. But I'm not in any condition to greet Lukako. I can't stop sweating. And it's not because of the heat. I don't know what's going on anymore. Questions keep spinning around in my head.
Mayuri: Did you decide to wear one of Mayushii's costumes? That would make me happy♪
Luka: Ah, no, that's not why I came...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako looks at me apologetically, like he wants to say something.
Rintaro: ...What is it?
UNSPOKEN: I reply mechanically. My mind is still blank.
Luka: Actually, Okabe-san... I mean, Kyouma-san, there's something I need to apologize for...
UNSPOKEN: What could he have to apologize for? Timidly, Lukako holds out his hand. And there, between his fingers...
Rintaro: Ah...!
UNSPOKEN: Is a LOTO SIX ticket. And the numbers are the same as the ones in my D-Mail! I grab Lukako by his slender wrist.
Rintaro: Where did you get this!?
Luka: T-that hurts...
Mayuri: Don't pick on Luka-kun!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri gets between us. I let go reluctantly.
Kurisu: What's wrong with you, Okabe? You're acting weird.
