UNSPOKEN: I press the button. My phone displays a flying mail animation and the words Sending mail. 116... 115... A wave of vertigo washes over me. It feels as if my feet have left the ground. Suddenly, my vision blurs, and everything turns monochrome. Is the ground shaking? Every cell in my body is screaming, This is wrong!
Mayuri: "Okarin? Are you okay?"
Rintaro: "...!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri’s voice brings me to my senses. I realize that color has returned to the world. What was that just now?
Mayuri: "Are you okay?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri waves her hand in front of my face. After blinking several times, I notice I’m standing stock still, gripping my phone. My phone should be displaying Mail Sent, but it’s not. Instead, it’s showing the normal standby display. Something isn’t right here. I look around. I’m inside the lab. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) isn’t on. When I sent the mail, the timer read 115. In other words, it should still be running for about two more minutes. Yet now, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is silent. I scan the room. Other things feel wrong.
Itaru: "Hmm..."
UNSPOKEN: Just a few seconds ago, Daru was sitting in front of the X68000. But now he’s sitting in front of the lounge computer. Did he teleport? At least, I don’t remember seeing Daru get up and move to the lounge. Kurisu is sitting cross-legged on the sofa, reading a massive technical book. She should be in the development room too. Moeka is standing at the edge of the development room. Nothing particularly different about her. Mayuri is next to me, looking at me with a confused expression. This is wrong.
Rintaro: "Mayuri, how long have I been standing here?"
Mayuri: "Eh? What do you mean?"
Rintaro: "Just tell me."
Mayuri: "Hm... maybe 30 seconds?"
Rintaro: "30 seconds? Really?"
Mayuri: "Yup. You suddenly ran over to the PhoneWave, then you took out your phone and started going ’haaah haaah!"
Itaru: "Say that again, Mayushii."
UNSPOKEN: Daru calls out from the lounge.
Mayuri: "Huh? You started going haah haah?"
Itaru: "The haah haah part!"
Mayuri: "Haah haah!"
Itaru: "More sexy this time!"
Kurisu: "Stop it, perv."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu and Daru are exchanging their usual banter. How can these guys be so calm? I just sent a mail that may have changed the past. Why aren’t they interested in the result?
Rintaro: "Th-that’s right, the mail!"
UNSPOKEN: I quickly check my mail.
Rintaro: "The mail arrived a week ago."
Mayuri: "Hm? What’s going on?"
Rintaro: "The money! Did I win the LOTO SIX?"
UNSPOKEN: I search my memories, but turn up nothing. No memories of buying a ticket. No memories of winning 3rd place. Nothing.
Rintaro: "Hey, Celeb Sev, did I win 3rd place?"
Kurisu: "Don’t call me Celeb Sev! And 3rd place of what?"
