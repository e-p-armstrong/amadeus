Rintaro: Sorry, Lukako, but I need to know. Where did you get that LOTO SIX ticket?
Luka: Um... you told me the numbers.
Rintaro: I... did?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako nods with teary eyes.
Luka: You told me to buy them because they might win...
Rintaro: R-really? When was that!?
Luka: A week ago...
UNSPOKEN: Damn you, past me! What were you thinking!? This wasn't supposed to happen! However, the past certainly has changed. ...Or has it? It seems like it has, but at the same time, the present seems to have changed too.
Itaru: Wait, did Luka-shi win the LOTO SIX?
Mayuri: Wow! Okarin's a psychic!
Kurisu: Don't tell me... you sent the winning numbers with the PhoneWave?
UNSPOKEN: Her question makes no sense.
Rintaro: Why are you asking me that? You saw me send them.
Kurisu: I did? What are you talking about?
UNSPOKEN: Disconnect. Our stories don't match.
Rintaro: I sent the winning numbers in a D-Mail just now. We discussed it and decided that's what we would do. You all watched it happen. Then the past changed. It actually changed.
UNSPOKEN: I glance at the PhoneWave (name subject to change). There's no denying it now. That grotesque appliance, the bastard child of microwave and cell phone, actually changed the past. We have the power of a god! Though I still don't know why everyone else forgot about it.
Itaru: Hold on, Luka-shi! How much did you win!?
Rintaro: 700, 000, right? 3rd place.
UNSPOKEN: I answer with conviction. However...
Luka: Um...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako begins fidgeting. Something's strange about his behavior.
Luka: I'm really sorry, Kyouma-san. Even though you told me exactly what to do, I... Filled one of the numbers in wrong...
UNSPOKEN: Huh? He what? I stare at the numbers on the ticket in Lukako's trembling hands.
Luka: Um... if that '18' had been a '19', then it would've been 3rd place... just like Kyouma-san said.
Itaru: Nooo! So close! And yet so far!
UNSPOKEN: I'm pretty sure I sent it with a 19. I'll know if I check my phone's send history. I take out my phone. And bring up the send history.
Rintaro: ...Huh? It's gone! Why!?
UNSPOKEN: The D-Mail I sent has vanished from my send history. Just like everyone's memories. The D-Mail should be there... but it's not. Almost as if it never existed in the first place. I ignore the worried stares of my lab mems and head outside for some fresh air. I need to calm down and figure this out. The ticket Lukako bought turned out to be 4th place. The prize is just 5, 000 yen.
Suzuha: Hey there, Okabe Rintaro.
