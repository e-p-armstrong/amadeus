Rintaro: Brainwashed? Me?
Suzuha: Well, there's nobody else here.
Rintaro: ...I suppose you're right.
Suzuha: Which part? Being brainwashed? Or nobody else being here?
Rintaro: Being brainwashed.
Suzuha: You... were?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha suddenly steps up to me and grabs my face. Then she forces my eyes open with her index finger and thumb.
Rintaro: Nwohh!? Wh-wh-what are you doing!?
Suzuha: Don't move.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha peers into my eye with a serious expression. But a second later, she lets go and steps back.
Suzuha: You're okay. You haven't been brainwashed.
Rintaro: ...What?
Suzuha: When you're brainwashed, they usually put a chip on the inside of your lower eyelid.
UNSPOKEN: A... chip? Immediately after saying that, Suzuha gasps and covers her mouth. Then she puts her hand on my shoulder and gives me an embarrassed smile.
Suzuha: Okabe Rintaro. Please keep that confidential.
UNSPOKEN: Don't tell me. Is she...
Rintaro: So you've been captured by the Organization before. Just like me.
Suzuha: ...Huh? The Organization? Are you talking about SERN?
Rintaro: No! Say no more. I understand your pain all too well.
Suzuha: Y-you do?
Rintaro: The Organization's secret brainwashing facility, known as Apocalypse of Galient. That place is a living hell. I don't want to revive any suppressed memories.
Suzuha: Um, right. I don't think it was called Apokawhatever, though... But it certainly was a living hell.
Rintaro: I can tell you'll make a good comrade, Part-Time Warrior. The day of Ragnarok is near!
Suzuha: C-cool!
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha lifts her hand in a halfhearted gesture of enthusiasm.
Nae: Suzuha, what's 'brain watching'?
UNSPOKEN: Nae asks as she tugs on the hem of Suzuha's clothes.
Rintaro: Heh heh heh. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall be the one to answer that.
Nae: Eh!? No... that's okay.
UNSPOKEN: Nae hides behind Suzuha.
Suzuha: Ahaha! Looks like Nae's afraid of you, Okabe Rintaro.
Rintaro: You do well to fear me, Sister Braun, but you should also pay me respect. For I am the world's most infamous mad scientist!
Nae: You're infamous?
Rintaro: Indeed. World leaders would kill to get their hands on my genius brain cells.
Nae: Wow...
UNSPOKEN: Still clinging to Suzuha's waist, Nae opens her eyes even wider and gasps in admiration.
Suzuha: That's how people talk when they've been brainwashed, Nae.
Nae: Eh?
Rintaro: Nonsense, Part-Time Warrior. My brain has not been washed since the day I was born.
Nae: Are you a liar, Mister Okarin?
Rintaro: Don't call me that!
Nae: ...!
Suzuha: You shouldn't yell at children. Look, she's shaking.
