UNSPOKEN: Again, this feeling of disconnect. I approach Kurisu, who’s lounging on the sofa.
Rintaro: "What did you say just now?"
Kurisu: "Wh-what?"
Rintaro: "What the hell did you say just now!?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu glares back at me.
Kurisu: "Got a problem? I asked what, and then you just--"
Rintaro: "Not that! You said ’3rd place of what’, right!? I mean 3rd place of LOTO SIX!"
Kurisu: "What?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu gives me a puzzled look. It doesn’t seem like she’s messing with me.
Rintaro: "Daru! I sent myself the winning LOTO SIX numbers just now. Didn’t I?"
Itaru: "Holy crap!"
UNSPOKEN: Daru’s eyes light up.
Itaru: "That’s brilliant, man! We can use D-Mails to make ourselves billionaires! I could buy all the computer parts I want and go to MayQueen for every meal of the day! I AM SO PUMPED UP!"
UNSPOKEN: ...This is wrong.
Rintaro: "Mayuri, you were gonna buy a truckload of bananas... right?"
Mayuri: "A truckload? Who’s gonna fill it up?"
UNSPOKEN: ...This is wrong. I look at Moeka. She’s staring at the floor like usual, but I don’t miss the confused glance she throws my way.
Rintaro: "Wait! What happened to stage two of Operation Urd!?"
Kurisu: "By stage two, you mean an experiment to see if we can change the past, right?"
Rintaro: "R-right! That’s it!"
Itaru: "Yeah, that’s why we’re all thinking."
Rintaro: "What?"
Mayuri: "About what to send, so we can tell if the past has changed."
Itaru: "I think we should definitely go with Okarin’s LOTO SIX idea."
Mayuri: "Mayushii thinks we shouldn’t be so greedy for dough. Ah, but when I say dough, I don’t mean like for baking."
Kurisu: "I think we all know what you mean."
Mayuri: "Really? That’s great! So, instead of being greedy, we should do something that will bring peace to the world! Like, if we gave everybody in the whole wide world an Upa cushion, I think everyone would be happy♪"
Itaru: "The only ones who’d be happy are little kids and Mayu-shi."
UNSPOKEN: What? What are these guys saying? They’re acting like I never sent that D-Mail with the winning numbers.
Luka: "Um... hello?"
UNSPOKEN: The front door opens slowly, and Lukako sticks his head inside.
Mayuri: "Ah, it’s Luka-kun! Welcome♪"
Luka: "Pardon the sudden intrusion..."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako bows his head apologetically. Mayuri, Kurisu, and Daru go into welcome mode. Moeka... keeps staring at her phone. But I’m not in any condition to greet Lukako. I can’t stop sweating. And it’s not because of the heat. I don’t know what’s going on anymore. Questions keep spinning around in my head.
Mayuri: "Did you decide to wear one of Mayushii’s costumes? That would make me happy♪"
