Itaru: I'm not a perv! I'm a pervy gentleman!
Kurisu: What does that even mean!?
Mayuri: Hey, guys? Do you think Okarin's okay?
UNSPOKEN: I can hear voices from the second story window. And since we can hear them clearly from here... Suzuha starts chuckling.
Rintaro: You heard everything, didn't you?
Suzuha: Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I just couldn't help it!
Rintaro: Did you hear about the time machine too?
Suzuha: Oh, yeah. I heard. Way to go, you!
UNSPOKEN: She strikes my upper arm in what I assume is a gesture of encouragement. What is Way to go, you! supposed to mean?
Rintaro: You haven't told anyone, have you? If I can't trust you to keep silent, I'll have to take extreme--
Suzuha: I won't say a thing, I swear! Your secret's safe with me!
Rintaro: Great. There's just one thing I'd like to ask. Did you see some kind of electrical discharge on the second floor just now?
Suzuha: Electrical discharge? You mean like yesterday's rumbling?
UNSPOKEN: I nod.
Suzuha: It happened once before. You're lucky the boss wasn't around.
Nae: It shook. It was scary.
UNSPOKEN: I ignore the little girl's honest impression.
Rintaro: Just now, about a minute ago, it should've happened again.
Suzuha: Oh, really? I didn't see the second time.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha tilts her head quizzically, then turns back to her bicycle.
Suzuha: Maybe I was too preoccupied polishing my baby. Did you see it, Nae?
Nae: Nope.
UNSPOKEN: Sister Braun frantically shakes her head.
Rintaro: You didn't see the second one?
Nae: I didn't see it.
UNSPOKEN: Disappointment spreads through me. What does this mean? Events I remember happening... didn't. The fact that I sent a D-Mail. The fact that we argued over what to send. But Kurisu herself remembers that I called her 'Celeb Sev' during that argument. Right after sending the D-Mail, I was hit by a feeling of vertigo. That's probably related somehow.
Suzuha: Did something happen?
Rintaro: ...How much do you know about time travel?
Suzuha: ...What do you mean by that?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha seems slightly suspicious. So I explain to her what happened just now. Nae probably won't understand a word of it, so I don't think it'll be necessary to silence her.
Suzuha: ...I don't believe it.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha's dumbfounded after hearing my explanation.
Suzuha: I've never heard of anything like that. Is it true? Are you telling the truth?
Rintaro: Of course. We've created a bona-fide time machine. And we were able to change the past! Nobody can deny our accomplishments. That's right, nobody!
Suzuha: Geez! That's not what I meant!
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha grabs at her own hair in frustration. But then her expression turns thoughtful.
Suzuha: I don't know if what you're saying is true or not, but...
UNSPOKEN: She suddenly lowers her voice.
Suzuha: I think you should try asking John Titor.
Rintaro: ...John Titor?
Suzuha: I mean, he's a hot topic now, isn't he? A time traveler from the future! He might know something. Since you're both time travelers and all.
