UNSPOKEN: The D-Mail I sent has vanished from my send history. Just like everyone’s memories. The D-Mail should be there... but it’s not. Almost as if it never existed in the first place. I ignore the worried stares of my lab mems and head outside for some fresh air. I need to calm down and figure this out. The ticket Lukako bought turned out to be 4th place. The prize is just 5, 000 yen.
Suzuha: "Hey there, Okabe Rintaro."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha calls out to me. She’s still polishing her bicycle. Tennouji Nae is squatting next to her, watching her work with great interest. Two questions come to mind. One. How long has she been polishing that thing? Two. Just how much free time does the Braun Tube Workshop have?
Suzuha: "You look like you’ve been brainwashed. You okay?"
Rintaro: "Brainwashed? Me?"
Suzuha: "Well, there’s nobody else here."
Rintaro: "...I suppose you’re right."
Suzuha: "Which part? Being brainwashed? Or nobody else being here?"
Rintaro: "Being brainwashed."
Suzuha: "You... were?"
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha suddenly steps up to me and grabs my face. Then she forces my eyes open with her index finger and thumb.
Rintaro: "Nwohh!? Wh-wh-what are you doing!?"
Suzuha: "Don’t move."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha peers into my eye with a serious expression. But a second later, she lets go and steps back.
Suzuha: "You’re okay. You haven’t been brainwashed."
Rintaro: "...What?"
Suzuha: "When you’re brainwashed, they usually put a chip on the inside of your lower eyelid."
UNSPOKEN: A... chip? Immediately after saying that, Suzuha gasps and covers her mouth. Then she puts her hand on my shoulder and gives me an embarrassed smile.
Suzuha: "Okabe Rintaro. Please keep that confidential."
UNSPOKEN: Don’t tell me. Is she...
Rintaro: "So you’ve been captured by the Organization before. Just like me."
Suzuha: "...Huh? The Organization? Are you talking about SERN?"
Rintaro: "No! Say no more. I understand your pain all too well."
Suzuha: "Y-you do?"
Rintaro: "The Organization’s secret brainwashing facility, known as Apocalypse of Galient. That place is a living hell. I don’t want to revive any suppressed memories."
Suzuha: "Um, right. I don’t think it was called Apokawhatever, though... But it certainly was a living hell."
Rintaro: "I can tell you’ll make a good comrade, Part-Time Warrior. The day of Ragnarok is near!"
Suzuha: "C-cool!"
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha lifts her hand in a halfhearted gesture of enthusiasm.
Nae: "Suzuha, what’s ’brain watching’?"
UNSPOKEN: Nae asks as she tugs on the hem of Suzuha’s clothes.
Rintaro: "Heh heh heh. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall be the one to answer that."
Nae: "Eh!? No... that’s okay."
UNSPOKEN: Nae hides behind Suzuha.
Suzuha: "Ahaha! Looks like Nae’s afraid of you, Okabe Rintaro."
