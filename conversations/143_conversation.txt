UNSPOKEN: The undoing of past events could possibly be explained through the many-worlds interpretation that Titor talked about. And come to think of it, it was Titor's advice that led me to the IBN 5100. He should be able to give me a hint this time too. I quickly take out my phone.
Rintaro: It's me. John Titor may have come from the future to guide me. Yeah, that's right. His arrival here in 2010 must be the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo.
Nae: Who is he talking to?
Suzuha: Dunno. Who could it be? Maybe it's someone from the future.
Nae: From the future...!
Rintaro: ...Do you want to know who I'm talking to, Sister Braun?
Nae: N-no, I...
UNSPOKEN: Nae shakes her head rapidly. She looks scared. I respond with the weary expression of a mad scientist who has seen everything and lost much.
Rintaro: Good. Even if you are interested, never ask. I could tell you, but then I'd have to silence you. And I don't want to have to do that to an innocent girl.
Nae: ...!
Suzuha: Come on, stop scaring her. She's just a little girl.
UNSPOKEN: I assume Nae is frightened because of the aura of danger that follows me everywhere. She's right to be.
Rintaro: I'll get in touch with Titor immediately. Your advice is appreciated, Part-Time Warrior!
Suzuha: Ahaha, was I useful? That's gr--
UNSPOKEN: Part-Time Warrior's eyes pop open mid-sentence.
Suzuha: Oh crap! The boss is back! The boss is back!
UNSPOKEN: I follow Suzuha's glance to see a moped headed this way. Judging by the sheer size of the driver, it must be Mister Braun.
Suzuha: Nae, if Manager asks, tell him I was doing my job!
Nae: Okay. But you have to let me ride your bike, okay?
Suzuha: Okay, okay! Good luck, Okabe Rintaro! I'm rooting for you!
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha pats me on the shoulder and rushes into the workshop. Nae and I are left in front of the store. The driver stops the moped and takes off his full-face helmet, revealing Mister Braun.
Nae: Welcome back, Daddy!
Tennouji: Nae! What did this nutjob do to you!?
UNSPOKEN: Manager leaps from his moped and interposes himself between me and his daughter. His eyes are bloodshot. My spine freezes. What a powerful aura of malice!
Tennouji: You son of a... how dare you make moves on my precious daughter!? I'll kill ya!
Rintaro: W-wait! I haven't done anything!
Tennouji: Then why were you talking with Nae alone, huh!?
Rintaro: We weren't alone! Suzuha was here too! That girl was skipping work to polish her bicycle!
