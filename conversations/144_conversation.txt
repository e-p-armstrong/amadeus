Rintaro: "Indeed. World leaders would kill to get their hands on my genius brain cells."
Nae: "Wow..."
UNSPOKEN: Still clinging to Suzuha’s waist, Nae opens her eyes even wider and gasps in admiration.
Suzuha: "That’s how people talk when they’ve been brainwashed, Nae."
Nae: "Eh?"
Rintaro: "Nonsense, Part-Time Warrior. My brain has not been washed since the day I was born."
Nae: "Are you a liar, Mister Okarin?"
Rintaro: "Don’t call me that!"
Nae: "...!"
Suzuha: "You shouldn’t yell at children. Look, she’s shaking."
UNSPOKEN: But ’Mister’ makes me sound old. I’m not even old enough to drink yet... what a disgrace. No, there’s no point getting angry at a child. I need to show composure as an adult.
Kurisu: "You’re even more of a perv than Okabe! I’m not using ’-san’ for you any more!"
Itaru: "I’m not a perv! I’m a pervy gentleman!"
Kurisu: "What does that even mean!?"
Mayuri: "Hey, guys? Do you think Okarin’s okay?"
UNSPOKEN: I can hear voices from the second story window. And since we can hear them clearly from here... Suzuha starts chuckling.
Rintaro: "You heard everything, didn’t you?"
Suzuha: "Sorry, sorry. I didn’t mean to eavesdrop, but I just couldn’t help it!"
Rintaro: "Did you hear about the time machine too?"
Suzuha: "Oh, yeah. I heard. Way to go, you!"
UNSPOKEN: She strikes my upper arm in what I assume is a gesture of encouragement. What is Way to go, you! supposed to mean?
Rintaro: "You haven’t told anyone, have you? If I can’t trust you to keep silent, I’ll have to take extreme--"
Suzuha: "I won’t say a thing, I swear! Your secret’s safe with me!"
Rintaro: "Great. There’s just one thing I’d like to ask. Did you see some kind of electrical discharge on the second floor just now?"
Suzuha: "Electrical discharge? You mean like yesterday’s rumbling?"
UNSPOKEN: I nod.
Suzuha: "It happened once before. You’re lucky the boss wasn’t around."
Nae: "It shook. It was scary."
UNSPOKEN: I ignore the little girl’s honest impression.
Rintaro: "Just now, about a minute ago, it should’ve happened again."
Suzuha: "Oh, really? I didn’t see the second time."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha tilts her head quizzically, then turns back to her bicycle.
Suzuha: "Maybe I was too preoccupied polishing my baby. Did you see it, Nae?"
Nae: "Nope."
UNSPOKEN: Sister Braun frantically shakes her head.
Rintaro: "You didn’t see the second one?"
