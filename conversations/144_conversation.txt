UNSPOKEN: Tch, stubborn old man. He thinks he owns the place just because he owns the place.
Tennouji: Understand? I won't let you off easy next time you make moves on my daughter.
Rintaro: I wouldn't do something so suicidal.
UNSPOKEN: Mister Braun nods in satisfaction.
Tennouji: Nae, I bought some cream puffs, so let's eat them together.
Nae: Okay!
UNSPOKEN: He parks his moped next to Part-Time Warrior's bicycle, then enters the store hand in hand with his daughter. Cream puffs? You can't get any more out of character than that. Is this what having kids does to a man?
Tennouji: Hey, part-timer! I know you were slacking off! Hey! And why is the 42-inch on!? I thought I told you to turn it off!
Suzuha: I'm sorryyyyy!
UNSPOKEN: I leave Suzuha to her fate and return to the lab. I need to get in touch with Titor as quickly as possible. He might be able to give me the answers I seek. He might even be able to explain the event that I witnessed a few days ago -- the instantaneous disappearance of everyone on the streets of Akiba. When I burst into the lab, everyone looks at me with concerned expressions. Mayuri starts to speak, presumably to console me, but I put my hand up to stop her.
Rintaro: Wait! We'll talk when everything's over.
UNSPOKEN: I explain that we can't experiment anymore now that Mister Braun is back. Then I dismiss everyone for today.
Mayuri: Um, I'll buy more bananas tomorrow, okay?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri picks her Upa plush toy off the sofa and hands it to me.
Mayuri: So for now, hug this little guy suuuuper tight and cheer up, okay?
UNSPOKEN: Looks like she's worried about me. But she shouldn't be. It's my job to worry about her. She has work after this, so she leaves. Daru goes with her, probably to see Faris. Before he leaves, Lukako apologizes again for messing up the LOTO SIX ticket. He knows about the time machine now. Next time I see him, I'll make him a lab mem to secure his silence. Moeka leaves with nothing more than a tiny bow. In less than 30 minutes, Kurisu and I are the only ones left in the lab.
Rintaro: Hey, assistant. You're not going back to your hotel?
Kurisu: Is there a problem?
Rintaro: No, no problem. I was just wondering what you were still doing here.
Kurisu: Nothing. I just wanted to think for a bit.
Rintaro: Can't you think at your hotel?
Kurisu: What? You're kicking me out?
Rintaro: Ahh, I get it. You'd be lonely in your hotel room, but you have no friends, so you want me, the great Hououin Kyouma, to look after you. Isn't that right, you spoiled Celeb Sev?
Kurisu: You're the lonely one, aren't you? You've been acting gloomy all day. Do you need some advice? I'm an outsider, in a sense, so it should be easier to talk to me, right? A man getting advice from a younger woman is kind of *mumble mumble*, but if you're fine with that, then just ask away.
