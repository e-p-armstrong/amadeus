Rintaro: "...How much do you know about time travel?"
Suzuha: "...What do you mean by that?"
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha seems slightly suspicious. So I explain to her what happened just now. Nae probably won’t understand a word of it, so I don’t think it’ll be necessary to silence her.
Suzuha: "...I don’t believe it."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha’s dumbfounded after hearing my explanation.
Suzuha: "I’ve never heard of anything like that. Is it true? Are you telling the truth?"
Rintaro: "Of course. We’ve created a bona-fide time machine. And we were able to change the past! Nobody can deny our accomplishments. That’s right, nobody!"
Suzuha: "Geez! That’s not what I meant!"
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha grabs at her own hair in frustration. But then her expression turns thoughtful.
Suzuha: "I don’t know if what you’re saying is true or not, but..."
UNSPOKEN: She suddenly lowers her voice.
Suzuha: "I think you should try asking John Titor."
Rintaro: "...John Titor?"
Suzuha: "I mean, he’s a hot topic now, isn’t he? A time traveler from the future! He might know something. Since you’re both time travelers and all."
Rintaro: "I see... You could be right! No, there’s no doubt about it!"
UNSPOKEN: The undoing of past events could possibly be explained through the many-worlds interpretation that Titor talked about. And come to think of it, it was Titor’s advice that led me to the IBN 5100. He should be able to give me a hint this time too. I quickly take out my phone.
Rintaro: "It’s me. John Titor may have come from the future to guide me. Yeah, that’s right. His arrival here in 2010 must be the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo."
Nae: "Who is he talking to?"
Suzuha: "Dunno. Who could it be? Maybe it’s someone from the future."
Nae: "From the future...!"
Rintaro: "...Do you want to know who I’m talking to, Sister Braun?"
Nae: "N-no, I..."
UNSPOKEN: Nae shakes her head rapidly. She looks scared. I respond with the weary expression of a mad scientist who has seen everything and lost much.
Rintaro: "Good. Even if you are interested, never ask. I could tell you, but then I’d have to silence you. And I don’t want to have to do that to an innocent girl."
Nae: "...!"
Suzuha: "Come on, stop scaring her. She’s just a little girl."
UNSPOKEN: I assume Nae is frightened because of the aura of danger that follows me everywhere. She’s right to be.
Rintaro: "I’ll get in touch with Titor immediately. Your advice is appreciated, Part-Time Warrior!"
Suzuha: "Ahaha, was I useful? That’s gr--"
UNSPOKEN: Part-Time Warrior’s eyes pop open mid-sentence.
Suzuha: "Oh crap! The boss is back! The boss is back!"
UNSPOKEN: I follow Suzuha’s glance to see a moped headed this way. Judging by the sheer size of the driver, it must be Mister Braun.
Suzuha: "Nae, if Manager asks, tell him I was doing my job!"
