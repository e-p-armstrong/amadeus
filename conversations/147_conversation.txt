Rintaro: "I need to send some emails. If you insist on staying here, then be quiet and stay out of my way. Okay, Zombie?"
Kurisu: "Of all your stupid names, that one’s the worst."
UNSPOKEN: Despite her complaint, Kurisu makes no move to leave. She sits down on the sofa and starts reading a massive technical book. On closer inspection, I realize it’s in English. Maybe my assistant isn’t a genius, but just an extreme studier.
Rintaro: "Want some coffee?"
Kurisu: "Sure."
UNSPOKEN: I make some instant coffee for Kurisu. I take a fresh Dr P out of the refrigerator for myself and sit down in front of the computer. Alright, let’s do what needs to be done. I only hope this doesn’t get undone too. My plan is to follow Suzuha’s advice. Get in touch with Titor. After all, what I’m experiencing right now could have something to do with the many-worlds interpretation. Which would mean that the Kurisu sitting over there isn’t the same Kurisu with whom I discussed the LOTO SIX. And it would mean that this lab isn’t the lab where we discussed it. How can that be?
Kurisu: "What’s wrong with you? Stop fidgeting."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu glares at me coldly. Dammit. She’s looking at me like I’m a perv again. I keep telling her I’m not a perv. I’m Hououin Kyouma. Anyway, why am I the only one who remembers what happened? That’s another question I’ll ask John Titor. I don’t know if he’s a real time traveler, but he did help with the IBN 5100, so I’m inclined to trust him. But what should I write? Should I tell him everything? In any case, worrying about it won’t solve anything. Enough stalling. I take out my phone. I sigh and chug my soda. Now to wait for his reply. I check the @channel thread just to make sure, but Titor hasn’t posted recently.
Kurisu: "That was a pretty heavy sigh."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu says without lifting her eyes from her book. Maybe I should tell her about how that D-Mail changed the past. And about how she seems to have lost her memories about it. Why am I considering talking to Kurisu? Because I don’t think Mayuri or Daru would understand this problem. Kurisu, on the other hand, might be able to form a hypothesis. That’s what I hope. Just then, my phone rings. Is it Titor? Titor’s calling me!? Startled, I look at my phone’s display. It’s Daru. I click my tongue in disappointment. Don’t scare me like that.
Rintaro: "Christina. There’s something I want to talk to you about."
Kurisu: "Shouldn’t you answer your phone first?"
Rintaro: "It’s Daru. It’s probably something stupid."
