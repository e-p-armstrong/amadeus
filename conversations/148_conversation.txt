Rintaro: "You might not remember this, but earlier, I changed the past with a D-Mail."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu stares at me. Her expression is more stern than usual.
Kurisu: "...I haven’t known you long enough to tell whether you’re serious."
Rintaro: "It happened. And then everyone except me forgot about it. Or rather, the fact that it happened was erased from history."
Kurisu: "The past changed, so the present changed with it? The Butterfly Effect, huh. But what you’re saying is nonsense."
Rintaro: "Why do you say that?"
Kurisu: "Why do you remember that the past changed? If you used a time machine to physically travel to the past and change history, then that might explain it -- barely. But with a D-Mail, you haven’t taken one step outside the present, have you?’ So if the present changed, and we changed with it, you would have to change too. Or are you saying you didn’t change because you’re the observer? In that case, you’re claiming that you’re not a human being."
UNSPOKEN: I understand what Kurisu’s saying, and I don’t have the means to convince her otherwise. And that’s exactly why I’m trying to get in touch with Titor.
Rintaro: "...Everything is the choice of Steins Gate! This is the power of my magic eye, Reading Steiner! Muhahaha!"
Kurisu: "Aaaand he’s at it again."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu sighs and goes back to her book.
Kurisu: "I’m not playing along with your games. I bet you came up with that Reading Whatever thing just now, didn’t you?"
UNSPOKEN: I should have known better than to approach Kurisu unprepared. There’s still not enough information, even for a mad scientist like me, to explain the things I’ve experienced. I bite my lip in frustration.
Rintaro: "Hello?"
Itaru: "Okarin! I’ve made a terrible mistake!"
Rintaro: "Mistake?"
UNSPOKEN: Is it about the PhoneWave (name subject to change)? Is it related to the phenomenon I experienced earlier? I gulp. I know it’s pathetic for a mad scientist to show anxiety, but I can’t help it. I lick my dry lips and wait for Daru to speak.
Itaru: "Actually... I left my wallet at the lab."
Rintaro: "Wh...at?"
Itaru: "I can’t go to MayQueen like this! Can you bring me my wallet? I’ll buy you a drink."
Rintaro: "Go jump in the river!"
UNSPOKEN: I shout and hang up. Dammit! I got stressed for nothing. But right afterward, my phone rings again.
Rintaro: "Tch, persistent little..."
UNSPOKEN: It’s only a three minute walk from the lab to MayQueen. Come get it yourself.
Rintaro: "Yeah? I’m not delivering your wallet, okay!?"
Mayuri: "Tutturu♪ Okarin, Okarin!"
Rintaro: "Oh, it’s you. You’re with Daru, right? You don’t have to lend that dumbass any money, okay?"
Mayuri: "Um, okay♪ So, Okarin, I was wondering if you cheered up. Did you hug Upa like I said?"
Rintaro: "No! I am a mad scientist full of madness and ambition!"
