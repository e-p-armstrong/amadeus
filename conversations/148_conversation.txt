Rintaro: My true power... is the magic eye, 'Reading Steiner'!
Kurisu: Sounds to me like you've got a bad case of chuunibyou.
Rintaro: Eh?
Kurisu: Eh...?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu hides her face in her book. She pretends to read, but I can see from here that her ears are bright red. How does she know about chuunibyou? Is she an @channeler after all? No, that doesn't matter now. I need to reply to Titor. Ok, now it's getting creepy. Is this some new cult? Or is he really trying to con me here? He's also contradicting himself again. The Titor who appeared in 2000 said he traveled back in time to retrieve technology lost in World War III. Yet this guy's saying he came to prevent the creation of a dystopia ruled by SERN. This guy might be an impostor. I'm fed up, so I quit replying. But just as I'm about to put away my phone--
Rintaro: ...Tch.
UNSPOKEN: Another mail comes. I open up my phone reluctantly while enduring Kurisu's cold glare. And what I read there... Raises the hairs on the back of my neck. What is this? Fear? Disgust? I don't know, but something is very wrong.
Rintaro: John Titor is a fraud!
UNSPOKEN: I scream at the absurdity. Daru and Kurisu give me exasperated stares, but I ignore them.
Rintaro: Me, the Messiah? Hmph. Ludicrous! To think that I would save humanity! I am no Messiah! I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, who has walked through fire and bathed in an ocean of blood to escape the clutches of the Organization! My desire is chaos unending. Do you think that destroying the System will bring peace to the world? The answer is no! No, I say! Death to the naive fools who believe such lies! The collapse of authority means that lawless CHAOS shall reign! MUHAHAHAHA!
Itaru: Um, Makise-shi? What the hell happened to Okarin?
Kurisu: Beats me. A few hours ago, he was exchanging emails with John Titor, and then he suddenly got quiet. And then he started ranting. He's been like this for half an hour.
Itaru: He's been acting strange all day, don't you think?
Kurisu: Agreed.
Rintaro: Listen up, lab mems! It's time to resume Operation Urd!
Itaru: Seriously? The manager's still downstairs, you know?
Rintaro: Fret not. It's almost closing time for the Braun Tube Workshop.
Kurisu: The PhoneWave doesn't work at night, remember?
Rintaro: It's worth a try! We need to figure out how late the PhoneWave (name subject to change) works. At the same time, I want to see if the two of you can use D-Mails to change the past.
Itaru: Change the past...!
