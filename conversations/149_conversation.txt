UNSPOKEN: Preparations for the PhoneWave (name subject to change) are complete. Daru's eyes wander to the ceiling in thought. Next to him, Kurisu shrugs her shoulders and starts gathering her things.
Kurisu: I'm going back to my hotel. Show me your report on today's experiment tomorrow.
Rintaro: Hold it!
UNSPOKEN: When I grab her by the shoulder, Kurisu nearly topples over.
Kurisu: Hey! What's your problem!?
Rintaro: Who's writing that report?
Kurisu: You, of course. This is your operation. And if we could get a report from the subject too, that would be even better.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu glances at Daru.
Rintaro: ...Are you not interested in changing the past? What happened to your eagerness to experiment?
Kurisu: Did you forget what I said this afternoon? I'm against it.
Rintaro: But you were so enthusiastic when we began the experiments. You went along without a single complaint.
Kurisu: In your dreams, maybe.
UNSPOKEN: I twist my lips into a grin.
Rintaro: You're not being objective, Christi... Celeb Sev.
Kurisu: If you're going to correct yourself, at least get it right.
Rintaro: We've already performed one experiment. I changed the past.
Itaru: Hey! No fair!
Rintaro: Ah, but you were in on it too. But when the past changed, you forgot that it had ever happened.
Itaru: Are you talking about this afternoon? I mean, when you suddenly started asking about the LOTO SIX.
Rintaro: Exactly.
UNSPOKEN: I explain what happened earlier this afternoon.
Itaru: ...You're not joking, are you?
Rintaro: I'm serious.
Itaru: ...Seriously?
UNSPOKEN: One good look at my face, and Daru seems to understand I'm not joking. Kurisu, on the other hand, has a sour look. But she's always like that. Why did everyone else lose their memories? Actually, did everyone else lose their memories? In order to find out, I need them to perform the same experiment.
Itaru: Okay! There's one thing about the past I definitely want to change.
UNSPOKEN: Daru is quick to adapt, as always. We've known each other for a long time. He trusts me implicitly. ...Or maybe he's just being faithful to his desires.
Rintaro: What? Are you going to tell yourself to go on a diet?
Itaru: I wouldn't diet even if future me told me to.
UNSPOKEN: Daru tells me he wants to change the events of the Faris Cup held at MayQueen+NyanÂ² a few days ago. On that day, Daru got insta-killed by Faris in a RaiNet AccessBattlers match.
Rintaro: You're gonna change the result?
Itaru: I remember every move Faris-tan made. It'll be easy to take her from behind. Aren't I a genius?
UNSPOKEN: Hmm... Faris is probably too good for that to work. She'll just counter his counter-strategy.
Rintaro: Whatever. Daru, prepare to D-Mail!
Itaru: Hell yeah! I'll give it my best shot!
