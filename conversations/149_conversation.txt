Rintaro: "You understand me?"
Mayuri: "Sure! We’ve been together since we were little, after all. Ehehe!"
Rintaro: "...Hmph. I’m hanging up. Work hard now."
Mayuri: "Thanks! Bye!"
Rintaro: "...Hmph, she thinks she knows me."
Kurisu: "Okabe. You’re grinning."
Rintaro: "...!! N-nonsense, Celeb Sev!"
Kurisu: "Don’t call me Celeb Sev!"
UNSPOKEN: I was going to tell Kurisu the truth, but now I’ve changed my mind. The mad scientist Hououin Kyouma would never grin at the words of a mere hostage like Mayuri.
Kurisu: "You look like a girl in love waiting for an email from her boyfriend."
UNSPOKEN: She sure likes to attack me for every little thing.
Rintaro: "Are you really that desperate for attention?"
Kurisu: "Just getting revenge. You’re always making fun of me, so I deserve at least this much."
Rintaro: "Despite what you may think, I actually respect you."
Kurisu: "That’s rich. You don’t even say my name right."
Rintaro: "I’m sorry about that."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu lifts her face and stares at me in shock.
Kurisu: "Well, that’s unexpected... You actually apologized."
Rintaro: "I do apologize. But I can’t help it. For my brain has recorded you as my assistant, Christina, and I cannot correct it! MUHAHAHAHA!"
Kurisu: "I’m gonna crack your skull open and stick electrodes in your hippocampus."
UNSPOKEN: Right after that silly exchange, John Titor’s mail arrives. I quickly open the mail.
Kurisu: "Who are you talking to?"
Rintaro: "John Titor."
Kurisu: "Huh? No way."
Rintaro: "He’s open to discussion as long as you’re not trying to troll him, and his mail address is public. This is the second time we’ve exchanged mails."
Kurisu: "No wonder you keep referencing Titor’s posts. You believe him, don’t you?"
Rintaro: "Not entirely. But there are several points in his story I do agree with."
Kurisu: "Really? I can’t see it as anything but fiction."
UNSPOKEN: The tone of Titor’s mail has suddenly changed. He thinks I have some kind of power? First, I feel a sense of pride. Next comes apprehension. Could this be a trap? In the first place, I can’t confirm if this is the real John Titor. And I don’t even know if the John Titor from 2000 was really a time traveler. If Titor’s worldline theory holds, then that could explain the supernatural events I’ve experienced. But this last statement is pretty hard to swallow. As soon as I begin to doubt, all of his words start to smell like lies. That stuff about the IBN 5100 might have been a lie too. That mysterious program code could be just a simple bug. Now that he claims I have special powers, he’s starting to sound like some new-age con artist. And besides, I don’t need Titor to tell me that.
Rintaro: "Muhahahahaha!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu jerks at the sound of my laughter.
Kurisu: "D-don’t just start laughing like that. It’s creepy."
