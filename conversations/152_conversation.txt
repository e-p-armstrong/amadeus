Rintaro: "You’re gonna change the result?"
Itaru: "I remember every move Faris-tan made. It’ll be easy to take her from behind. Aren’t I a genius?"
UNSPOKEN: Hmm... Faris is probably too good for that to work. She’ll just counter his counter-strategy.
Rintaro: "Whatever. Daru, prepare to D-Mail!"
Itaru: "Hell yeah! I’ll give it my best shot!"
UNSPOKEN: Daru hunches over and starts typing out the mail, leaving me to input the forwarding address into the PhoneWave (name subject to change). I sit in front of the X68000 and take a look at my watch. It’s 6:55 PM. No way to know if the PhoneWave (name subject to change) will operate at this hour. We haven’t figured out the exact window yet.
Kurisu: "So why do you think you’re the only one who remembers?"
Rintaro: "You’re awfully persistent. I see why they call you The Zombie."
Kurisu: "I don’t follow."
Rintaro: "Zombies never stop coming. They’re persistent."
Kurisu: "Cut the jokes. I’m serious here."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu’s glare is scarier than usual. I might’ve wet myself a little there.
Rintaro: "I think that the key is who receives the D-Mail. Only the recipient himself is able to retain his memories. That would be my guess."
Kurisu: "Hmmm..."
UNSPOKEN: Actually, that hypothesis doesn’t explain the mass disappearance in Akihabara. Of course, I still don’t have concrete proof that the mass disappearance incident was related to D-Mail. We’ll never know unless we experiment.
Rintaro: "After Daru, you’ll send the next D-Mail. Think about what you want to write."
Kurisu: "No."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu replies emphatically.
Kurisu: "I’m not sending one."
Rintaro: "Scared?"
Kurisu: "That’s not it."
Rintaro: "Then are you worried about time paradoxes?"
Kurisu: "Well, there’s that, but it’s more like a personal policy."
UNSPOKEN: A policy?
Kurisu: "Changing the past feels like cheating. I may only have 18 years of life experience, but I don’t want to change any of those memories."
Rintaro: "I see. You’re perfect now, so you don’t want to change."
Kurisu: "That’s not what I said... I don’t want to deny who I’ve been. Because even my failures are a part of who I am today."
Rintaro: "Even if we solved all of the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s problems, you wouldn’t use it? Even if John Titor said you could use his time machine to travel to whatever time you wish, you wouldn’t use it? Even if a blue robot cat from the future were to jump out of your desk and give you a doorway to everywhere, you wouldn’t use it?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu nods firmly.
Kurisu: "I wouldn’t."
Rintaro: "But you love experiments. Don’t you?"
Kurisu: "S-something wrong with that?"
Rintaro: "So basically, you like to experiment on other people while you watch and cackle at the results! You truly are a mad scientist!"
Kurisu: "Why you--"
Itaru: "Done!"
