Itaru: Whoa, that sounds worse than earthquakes.
Kurisu: I know it looks like SERN is able to create Kerr black holes willy-nilly, but that's not supposed to be possible. You can't just press a button and make a black hole. Even if you could, the risks would be unthinkable. It's ridiculous to suggest that a household microwave could generate a black hole.
UNSPOKEN: Titor's time machine is small enough to fit inside a car, and it makes black holes. Well, that's what he said, at least. Now that I'm a little skeptical of Titor, I don't feel like bringing it up.
Kurisu: My point is that there has to be something else going on here. Some outside source must be injecting electrons into this microwave.
UNSPOKEN: An outside source of electrons... What could that be?
Kurisu: Well, I'm going back to my hotel. I've had enough of this filthy man cave. See you tomorrow. Don't forget to write that report.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu flings off her lab coat and hurries out the door. ...She was serious about the report?
Itaru: Hmm... Makise-shi's lab coat... I wonder what it smells like...
UNSPOKEN: As Daru reaches for the lab coat to smell Kurisu's lingering fragrance, I grab him by the neck and pull down hard.
Rintaro: Cut that out! If you have time to be perverted, then go think about how to change the past for tomorrow's experiment!
UNSPOKEN: There wasn't anything to do after Kurisu left. I tried operating the PhoneWave (name subject to change) a couple more times before I went to sleep, but the discharge phenomenon simply would not occur. Now it's the next morning, and I'm sitting on the bench in front of the Braun Tube Workshop. It's still early, but it's already blazing hot. It's as if I'm baking in the sun. Sweat is dripping off my chin. We're supposed to be experimenting today, but not a single lab mem has arrived yet. After waiting impatiently for a while, the first person I see is...
Tennouji: Okabe! Don't you have anything better to do?
Nae: Good morning, Mister Okarin.
UNSPOKEN: The Tennouji pair come riding in on a moped.
Rintaro: How many times do I have to tell you? Call me Kyouma!
Nae: Um... what should I do, Daddy?
Tennouji: What nonsense are you trying to feed my daughter?
Rintaro: Have you not properly educated her, Mister Braun? This child of yours refuses to call me by my true name. Please do something about it.
