Kurisu: "I don’t get it."
UNSPOKEN: Me neither.
Itaru: "It’s how Faris-tan placed her cards. Can’t you tell? You guys are lame."
UNSPOKEN: Well, whatever. Preparations are complete. If this works, the mail will arrive at Daru’s phone 52 hours ago. The discharge phenomenon occurs normally. I close my eyes to shield them from the lightning and sparks. The D-Mail was sent. Daru should have received it two days ago. However...
Rintaro: "Why do I remember?"
UNSPOKEN: When I sent a D-Mail earlier this afternoon, everyone else forgot all about it. If Daru’s D-Mail changed the past, then the present should have changed too. Daru should be the only one who remembers that he sent a D-Mail.
Itaru: "Did the past change?"
UNSPOKEN: Daru looks around in confusion.
Rintaro: "Wait. Daru, you remember too?"
Itaru: "Huh? Remember what?"
Rintaro: "That you just sent a D-Mail!"
UNSPOKEN: Daru nods. Then I turn to Kurisu. She answers before I ask.
Kurisu: "Of course I remember. What are you... Oh, I see. According to your hypothesis, you and I shouldn’t remember sending the D-Mail."
Rintaro: "Daru, did you beat Faris in the Faris Cup?"
Itaru: "...I dunno."
Rintaro: "You said the winner gets Faris’s home cooking, right? Did you eat it? What happened?"
Itaru: "I don’t know... This sucks."
UNSPOKEN: I check Daru’s send history. As expected, the D-Mail he just sent isn’t there. I do, however, find the D-Mail in his inbox. He received it two days ago, just like we wanted. This is the same thing that happened when I sent my D-Mail.
Kurisu: "...Maybe the past hasn’t changed?"
Itaru: "I’ll try calling Mayu-shi."
UNSPOKEN: He’s the one who changed the past, yet he doesn’t remember what happened after the change? That’s odd.
Itaru: "Mayu-shi? You’re still at work, right? Is Faris-tan there? ...She is!? Um, can you ask her if I beat her in the Faris Cup? Did I get to eat her home cooking? ...Who lost? I did? Oh... Barely took five seconds? Oh... okay..."
UNSPOKEN: Daru’s shoulders droop as he hangs up the phone.
Kurisu: "I guess that means the past hasn’t changed."
Itaru: "Why!? It changed for Okarin, right!?"
Kurisu: "Maybe your foolproof plan wasn’t so foolproof. Like, maybe it only gave you a slight advantage."
UNSPOKEN: I had the same thought. Faris is supposedly a world-class player. Daru’s time travel cheat may not have been enough.
Kurisu: "Since Faris-san defeated you anyway, the past didn’t change."
Itaru: "Yeah, but I mean, the game would’ve played out differently."
Rintaro: "That might not be enough to cause worldline divergence."
Kurisu: "Like Okabe said, you need to make a change that’s easier to observe. Or else there’s no point to this experiment. Um, n-not that I approve of this experiment or anything."
Itaru: "No, it’s not over yet. I can still fight!"
