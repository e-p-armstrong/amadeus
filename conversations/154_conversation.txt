Mayuri: Chris-chan, tutturuâ™ª
Kurisu: Good morning.
Rintaro: What did you say to the part-timer downstairs?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu shrugs her shoulders.
Kurisu: Nothing much. I told her if she wanted to say something, she should just say it.
UNSPOKEN: I don't think that's nothing... She's lucky that didn't lead to blows.
Rintaro: What did she say?
Kurisu: Nothing. She just groaned. I wonder what's wrong with her.
Itaru: She's jealous of Makise-shi's popularity, duh!
UNSPOKEN: Daru bursts into the lab.
Itaru: She's thinking 'If only I'd joined the lab instead of her. Then I would be having fun with everyone right now! I'm so jealous!' or something like that. I'm telling you, man. 3D is hell.
Kurisu: If she wants my lab mem number, she can have it.
Rintaro: What!? The lab mem number you carry is the highest credential a scientist could hope to achieve! They sell for millions on the black market, but you would give it away!?
Kurisu: It's not exactly a counterfeit passport. Also, shut up.
Mayuri: Mayushii wants everyone to get along.
UNSPOKEN: Well, I don't really care about their little quarrel anyway. Only one thing interests me now: the mystery of D-Mail. We begin experimenting immediately. Even though it's still morning, the electrical discharge occurs on demand. Things look favorable today. That reminds me. We haven't talked to Mister Braun yet. Maybe we should come up with an excuse first. To be honest, though, I don't care what he thinks. For we are at war! War against the Organization and SERN, the dark powers that rule the world from the shadows!
Itaru: Anzai-sensei, I want to eat Faris-tan's home cooking...
Mayuri: If you give up, it's game over!
UNSPOKEN: Unfortunately, Daru's second D-Mail fails to change the past. I get the feeling RaiNet matches are difficult to cheat your way out of like this. Not to mention we're limited to 36 bytes of text. Looks like we have to give up on Daru. He's gone to drown his sorrows in the internet. Alright, so who do we experiment on? From the look on Kurisu's face, I don't think she's willing to change her policy. That leaves only one candidate.
Rintaro: Mayuri, it's time for you to change the past.
Mayuri: Eh? Me? Are you sure? But, um... what should I change?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri looks stumped as she slurps her canned ramen.
Mayuri: Oh, I know! I'll make Luka-kun wear one of my costumes!
Rintaro: How?
Mayuri: By sending Luka-kun a mail! Ehehe!
UNSPOKEN: I don't think a simple request is going to change the past...
Rintaro: Can't you think of anything easier to change and observe?
Mayuri: Hmm...
UNSPOKEN: She slurps more ramen.
Rintaro: ...Let's use that canned ramen.
UNSPOKEN: Looks like I'm the only one with ideas.
Rintaro: You'll send a D-Mail to yourself one hour ago. Type 'I wanna eat canned oden' or something like that.
