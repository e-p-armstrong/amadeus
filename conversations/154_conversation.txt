Itaru: "One more time. I’ll try sending my past self some more advice. This time, something that’ll ensure my victory."
Kurisu: "You really want to win that badly?"
Rintaro: "More like he wants to eat Faris’s home cooking that badly."
Itaru: "That’s my Final Answer."
UNSPOKEN: Daru writes another D-Mail. I don’t bother checking what it says. I won’t understand anyway. We activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and send the mail through, just like before.
Rintaro: "Oh...?"
UNSPOKEN: Nothing happens. No discharge. Usually, it happens ten to twenty seconds after pushing the start button. The timer counts down to zero without incident.
Kurisu: "...Out of time?"
Rintaro: "Looks like it."
Itaru: "But my advice was perfect..."
Rintaro: "There’s nothing we can do about it. We’ll postpone the experiment till tomorrow."
UNSPOKEN: I check the clock. It’s just past 7PM. Looks like that’s the cutoff.
Kurisu: "After I left yesterday, I was thinking. How exactly does the PhoneWave make time travel possible?"
Rintaro: "It works like the LHC. Didn’t you say the LHC was like a giant microwave?"
Kurisu: "If every microwave could turn into the LHC, then Japan would have black holes popping up everywhere."
Itaru: "Whoa, that sounds worse than earthquakes."
Kurisu: "I know it looks like SERN is able to create Kerr black holes willy-nilly, but that’s not supposed to be possible. You can’t just press a button and make a black hole. Even if you could, the risks would be unthinkable. It’s ridiculous to suggest that a household microwave could generate a black hole."
UNSPOKEN: Titor’s time machine is small enough to fit inside a car, and it makes black holes. Well, that’s what he said, at least. Now that I’m a little skeptical of Titor, I don’t feel like bringing it up.
Kurisu: "My point is that there has to be something else going on here. Some outside source must be injecting electrons into this microwave."
UNSPOKEN: An outside source of electrons... What could that be?
Kurisu: "Well, I’m going back to my hotel. I’ve had enough of this filthy man cave. See you tomorrow. Don’t forget to write that report."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu flings off her lab coat and hurries out the door. ...She was serious about the report?
Itaru: "Hmm... Makise-shi’s lab coat... I wonder what it smells like..."
UNSPOKEN: As Daru reaches for the lab coat to smell Kurisu’s lingering fragrance, I grab him by the neck and pull down hard.
Rintaro: "Cut that out! If you have time to be perverted, then go think about how to change the past for tomorrow’s experiment!"
