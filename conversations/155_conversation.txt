Rintaro: "How many times do I have to tell you? Call me Kyouma!"
Nae: "Um... what should I do, Daddy?"
Tennouji: "What nonsense are you trying to feed my daughter?"
Rintaro: "Have you not properly educated her, Mister Braun? This child of yours refuses to call me by my true name. Please do something about it."
Tennouji: "Who cares? Don’t be so picky. Nae, you don’t have to listen to what this guy says, okay?"
Nae: "Okay..."
UNSPOKEN: The manager parks his moped and quickly enters the store. Sister Braun’s about to follow him when--
Nae: "Ah."
UNSPOKEN: She turns her attention toward the end of the street and instantly brightens up. I follow her gaze and see Mayuri walking this way.
Mayuri: "Good morning, Okarin!"
Nae: "Mayuri!"
UNSPOKEN: Nae runs up to Mayuri with a happy smile. And without breaking stride, she jumps into Mayuri’s chest.
Mayuri: "Good morning, Nae-chan."
Nae: "Good morning."
UNSPOKEN: They get along so well that you’d think they were sisters. Mayuri has the ability to get along with anyone, so it’s no surprise. Nae avoids me and Daru, but she adores Mayuri, and always goes for a flying hug whenever she gets a chance. Daru sometimes complains about that. What a lucky girl! I wish I could jump into Mayu-shi’s chest like that! No, wait. Maybe it would be better to have Nae-tan jump into my chest! His internal debate went on for hours.
Mayuri: "This is for you, Nae-chan. Enjoy♪"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri takes some candy out of her convenience store bag and gives it to Nae.
Nae: "Thank you!"
Mayuri: "I have some for Okarin too!"
UNSPOKEN: She offers me some, which I silently accept.
Mayuri: "Why are you sitting out here?"
Rintaro: "I’m waiting for all lab mems to assemble."
Nae: "Um, are you slacking off?"
UNSPOKEN: Why you chipmunk! Do you have to be so blunt? One of these days, I’ll teach you to respect me!
Mayuri: "Um, Nae-chan? I’m sure Okarin’s thinking about important stuff."
Nae: "Oh... wow!"
UNSPOKEN: Good job, Mayuri.
Mayuri: "Okarin, Okarin. It’s too early to make PhoneWave-chan sparkle, right? Can I go nuke some yakisoba bread?"
Rintaro: "We removed the door. You can’t heat food in it anymore."
Mayuri: "Oh, right. That makes me sad... By the way, have you had breakfast?"
Rintaro: "Nope."
Mayuri: "Then let’s eat together. We can eat the yakisoba bread cold, and then heat up some canned ramen in hot water. Wanna join us, Nae-chan?"
Nae: "I’m okay. I ate."
Mayuri: "Okay!"
UNSPOKEN: Nae waves, then heads back inside the Braun Tube Workshop. Lured by the prospect of canned ramen, I go inside the lab with Mayuri. The stagnant air makes the room hotter than outside. It doesn’t improve much even after we open the window and turn on the fan.
Mayuri: "Daru-kun and Chris-chan are kinda late, huh?"
