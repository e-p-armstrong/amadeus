Kurisu: What? Don't apologize. It's creepy.
Rintaro: I know you're not a fan of time travel research. But here you are building a time machine. I was just worried that maybe you were feeling conflicted.
Kurisu: How rude.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's scowls.
Kurisu: I'm sure I've said this before, but I've always accepted time travel as a theory. I just don't trust people who claim it can be done despite how unrealistic it is.
UNSPOKEN: She sighs, then looks me over from head to toe.
Kurisu: Besides, I can hardly deny it with evidence staring me in the face. Though I still don't like the idea of being called the mother of the time machine.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha shrugs at this.
Kurisu: Anyway. If you're apologizing, that must mean you helped out the first time.
Rintaro: The first time?
Kurisu: Before you started time leaping. You helped me build the machine, didn't you?
Rintaro: Yeah. Daru and I helped.
Kurisu: Then don't worry about it. I wouldn't want you to have to do it all over again. And right now, it's more important to repair Amane-san's time machine and search for her father.
Suzuha: ...Sorry.
Kurisu: Don't you apologize now. It's weird. Welp, back to work. I should be able to get a lot done now that I know about the lifter.
