UNSPOKEN: Just then, the sound of a braking bicycle comes from downstairs. When I look out the window, I see Part-Time Warrior arriving. She immediately notices me, looks up, and waves.
Suzuha: "Sup!"
Mayuri: "Tutturu♪ Suzu-san."
Suzuha: "If it isn’t Shiina Mayuri! Tutturu♪"
UNSPOKEN: They seem to have hit it off. Like I said, Mayuri gets along with everyone.
Suzuha: "Okabe Rintaro, did you talk to Titor?"
Rintaro: "...Maybe."
UNSPOKEN: I thought I dodged the question, but Part-Time Warrior is persistent.
Suzuha: "Come on! You emailed him, didn’t you?"
Rintaro: "Yes, but I’m starting to doubt whether he can be trusted."
Suzuha: "What!? Why!? What went wrong!?"
UNSPOKEN: Why is she so flustered?
Rintaro: "Oh, so you’re a Titor otaku."
UNSPOKEN: I guess there’s an otaku for everything.
Mayuri: "Look, it’s Chris-chan!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri leans out the window to wave her hand. Kurisu is walking towards the lab. That reminds me. Doesn’t Part-Time Warrior have something against Kurisu? I look at Suzuha. Her expression has changed dramatically. Now she’s staring at Kurisu in complete silence. She doesn’t move a muscle. It’s like she’s trying to start a fight with her glare. Kurisu’s pretty stubborn too, so she meets Suzuha glare for glare. The two of them exchange a word or two in front of the building. For a second, I’m worried that they might start throwing punches, but that doesn’t happen.
Mayuri: "Chris-chan, tutturu♪"
Kurisu: "Good morning."
Rintaro: "What did you say to the part-timer downstairs?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu shrugs her shoulders.
Kurisu: "Nothing much. I told her if she wanted to say something, she should just say it."
UNSPOKEN: I don’t think that’s nothing... She’s lucky that didn’t lead to blows.
Rintaro: "What did she say?"
Kurisu: "Nothing. She just groaned. I wonder what’s wrong with her."
Itaru: "She’s jealous of Makise-shi’s popularity, duh!"
UNSPOKEN: Daru bursts into the lab.
Itaru: "She’s thinking ’If only I’d joined the lab instead of her. Then I would be having fun with everyone right now! I’m so jealous!’ or something like that. I’m telling you, man. 3D is hell."
Kurisu: "If she wants my lab mem number, she can have it."
Rintaro: "What!? The lab mem number you carry is the highest credential a scientist could hope to achieve! They sell for millions on the black market, but you would give it away!?"
Kurisu: "It’s not exactly a counterfeit passport. Also, shut up."
Mayuri: "Mayushii wants everyone to get along."
