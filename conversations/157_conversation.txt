UNSPOKEN: Is that supposed to be encouragement? Mayuri sounds concerned for some reason.
Itaru: So, whatcha gonna send? Okarin wants us to change the past in an easy-to-measure way, but that's setting the bar way too high.
Rintaro: Nonsense. You're all just aiming too low.
Moeka: I... have an idea.
UNSPOKEN: Moeka murmurs.
Rintaro: Oh? This could be good. Give us the details.
UNSPOKEN: Moeka then invokes her power once more. Ultra-fast typing. The power known as Shining Finger.
Rintaro: Excellent, Shining Finger! You're a model lab mem!
UNSPOKEN: This should make it easy to tell whether the past has changed. Looks like the three useless members have no objections to Moeka's superior idea. We look at Moeka's phone. It's purple and gaudy. There's no strap, and it's not like the deco phones popular among mainstream women nowadays.
Itaru: Oh, that's the GG01 that just came out last month.
Mayuri: Gee Gee Zero One?
Itaru: The latest model. Pretty sure the screen is detachable, so you can swap out attachments for it. It's in short supply right now, so you need to be placed on a waitlist. Nice job getting one.
UNSPOKEN: It's the most popular model, but she wants her old one back? I guess hardcore phone users have other concerns besides fashion.
Rintaro: So, Finger.
Mayuri: Um, why do you call Moeka-san 'Finger'?
Rintaro: That's the name of her esper power. Kiryu Moeka, I dub thee Shining Finger! Use this name with pride.
UNSPOKEN: Moeka shakes her head expressionlessly.
Rintaro: What? You don't like it? But it's such a cool name. What's the problem!?
Mayuri: Moeka-san is Moeka-san. Her fingers don't shine or anything...
Itaru: Don't feed the trolls, Mayu-shi.
Rintaro: I'm not trolling, just naming her power.
Kurisu: Cut the chatter and get started.
UNSPOKEN: Gh, dammit. You're just an assistant. Don't boss us around!
Itaru: What if the manager says something?
Rintaro: Muhahaha! Don't be afraid of Mister Braun! If he storms in yelling, I'll kick him to the curb!
Itaru: Seriously? Okarin, you're so cool! That's why we love you!
Kurisu: He's just talk.
UNSPOKEN: I'll be the adult and ignore Kurisu's insult. Moeka has already written her 36-byte mail. When I look at Moeka to see if she's ready, she nods faintly. We set the timer to 100 seconds. The D-Mail should arrive at Moeka's phone four days ago -- July 31st.
Rintaro: PhoneWave (name subject to change), activate!
