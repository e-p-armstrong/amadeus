Rintaro: What if we ask you to stay?
Suzuha: I'll go anyway. One of those guys on @channel asked what right I have to change the future and decide the fate of the human race. He had a point. But still... I don't want the future to turn out like that. I want the people in my time to be free like you. Free to laugh and play, fight and argue, get sad and cry. If I change the future, then no one will die. Not you, not Shiina Mayuri, and not my dad. Maybe I don't have the right... but I'm going anyway.
Rintaro: Even if you can never return?
Suzuha: Aw, come on! The 70s aren't a bad time, you know? I'll find friends there just like you guys. We'll have a blast!
UNSPOKEN: Just like that, Suzuha is back to her usual self. But despite her cheerful smile, I am certain that her resolve was forged from fear and doubt the likes of which few can imagine. I was a fool to think that my words could sway her. Beneath the clear blue sky, the time machine comes to life. Daru's repairs are complete. Mayuri and I help drain the last of the water out of the cockpit. The machine is still stuck in Radi-Kan's wall, but that's a small matter. Daru gazes at the time machine with a satisfied expression. Mayuri is jumping for joy, and Kurisu, who ran over as soon as she completed the Time Leap Machine, is visibly relieved. Meanwhile, Suzuha is struggling to attach her mountain bike to the time machine's exterior. She likes it so much, she wants to bring it with her to 1975. Kurisu was worried that it might cause a time paradox. My heart is still heavy. Should I let Suzuha leave like this? I chide myself for the thought. It's not my choice to make. Suzuha isn't from this time. If she doesn't want to stay, then I have no reason to keep her from leaving. Suzuha finishes securing her bicycle and turns to us with a soft smile. It's not the painful, forced smile I saw yesterday. We don't perform a startup test. Activating the time machine would draw too much attention. So we're just going to wing it. Fortunately, we have the Time Leap Machine for insurance. My only regret... is that we couldn't find her father.
Suzuha: Thanks, guys... really. I can't thank you enough.
Mayuri: Don't forget about us!
Itaru: If you want to thank me, then let's make out.
Kurisu: Control yourself, perv.
UNSPOKEN: The lab mems pat Suzuha on the shoulder and offer words of encouragement, each in his or her own way.
Suzuha: Oh right. Take this.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha offers me her father's pin. OSHM***A 7010. In the end, we couldn't decipher the inscription.
Suzuha: This is for you, Okabe Rintaro. Keep it in the lab, will you? Somewhere out of sight is fine.
Rintaro: Suzuha...
UNSPOKEN: Is she regretting her decision to leave? Is this pin meant to be proof that Amane Suzuha was here, with us, in this time?
Itaru: Um... about the pin.
UNSPOKEN: Daru hesitates for a moment, then steps forward.
Itaru: Why don't we make duplicates for all the lab mems? Make it our symbol, I guess.
Mayuri: Wow! That's a great idea!
Kurisu: How unusually thoughtful of you.
