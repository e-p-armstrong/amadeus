UNSPOKEN: The world lurches. I struggle to keep my balance. As I brace myself against further shaking, I try to analyze what I'm experiencing. This is far more intense than what happened when we sent the D-Mails yesterday. And yet, I've felt it before. I remember. This is what I felt right before the mass disappearance phenomenon. The shaking stops. I relax my body and look around. Has the past changed? Of course it has. That bizarre sensation just now was proof. I look around the room. The PhoneWave (name subject to change), which should have about 90 seconds left on the timer, is silent. Daru's here. Mayuri's here. Kurisu's here. ...Where's Moeka?
Rintaro: Where's Shining Finger? Where'd she go?
UNSPOKEN: Daru and Kurisu, who are discussing something in front of the X68000, look at me strangely. Ah... Again. This feeling of wrongness. It's the same as yesterday.
Kurisu: Shining what?
Itaru: Okarin. Japanese please.
UNSPOKEN: I leave the development room and check the lounge, behind the sofa, in the dressing room, the bathroom, and the shower room. I look out the window at the street below. But Moeka is nowhere to be found. She's... gone. No way. This is exactly what happened on the streets of Akiba. Why did she disappear!? Because I experimented on her!? Where did she go!? Did I erase her from history!? Did I banish her into the space between dimensions!? I start quivering in horror at the magnitude of my error. In a daze, I step up to Mayuri, who's eating a banana. I grab her shoulders and shake her.
Rintaro: Where's Kiryu Moeka? She was here just now, wasn't she!?
Mayuri: Uhwhaaa? Whoooo?
Rintaro: Kiryu Moeka!
UNSPOKEN: Daru and Kurisu give me strange looks as well.
Itaru: Who's that?
Kurisu: Never heard of her.
Rintaro: ...No way.
UNSPOKEN: So I did erase Moeka's existence... No... that can't be. I won't accept that I killed her!
Kurisu: Did it happen again, Okabe?
Rintaro: What do you mean, 'again'?
Kurisu: Something like this happened yesterday. You remembered something we didn't. Uh, what did you call it? Oh yeah, Reading Steiner.
