UNSPOKEN: Everyone, including me, starts looking around. Mayuri has us hook, line, and sinker. I scan the empty event hall, but there's no one else here. Where could he be?
Mayuri: Allow me to introduce you! Suzu-san's dad is... Drrrrrrrrrrrr...
Itaru: Is that a drum roll!?
Mayuri: Tada! Suzu-san's dad is...
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri flashes Suzuha a grin.
Mayuri: Daru-kun!
UNSPOKEN: She thrusts her finger at Daru. Our mouths drop. After awkward silence comes awkward laughter.
Kurisu: That joke's not even logical. It's impossible for this perv to get married in the first place.
Itaru: Hey... that kind of hurts.
Rintaro: I completely agree with Christina. Daru is fated to become a wizard when he turns thirty.
Itaru: You could be nicer about it, guys... but it's the truth, so I can't object.
UNSPOKEN: Daru falls to his hands and knees, devastated. As for Suzuha herself... she clearly doesn't know how to react.
Suzuha: Um... you know... my dad wasn't fat.
Mayuri: Geez. You're all so mean to Daru-kun.
Itaru: Mayu-shi's the only one to stand up for me. You're an angel, Mayu-shi. Do you love me?
Mayuri: Nope.
UNSPOKEN: Harsh.
Mayuri: Um, Mayushii's one hundred million percent sure that Daru-kun is Suzuha's dad.
Kurisu: Okay. What's your proof?
Mayuri: Um, I was thinking about the letters on Suzu-san's pin... After staring at it really hard, I noticed the 7 in '7010' looked a little weird. It's not a 7, it's a 2. The line fell off the bottom.
Suzuha: R-really?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha stares at the inscription on the pin again.
Suzuha: It's so small, I can't tell...
Mayuri: It's easy to see on the picture we took!
Kurisu: 2010? But that's this year!
