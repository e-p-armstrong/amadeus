UNSPOKEN: It’s decided. I type a reply to Moeka’s mail. After sending it off, I hurry back to the lab. When I get back to the lab, Moeka is squatting at the bottom of the staircase. Since she’s not sitting on the bench, I guess that crouching while holding her knees is this particular woman’s favorite position. She’s staring at her phone like usual. Once she notices me approaching, she slowly stands up. But she doesn’t look at me.
Moeka: "...Thank you."
Rintaro: "For what? I don’t think you’re selfish. In fact, I’m grateful for your offer."
UNSPOKEN: Once we enter the lab, I get all the lab mems to stop what they’re doing, and then tell them about Moeka’s situation.
Mayuri: "I think it’s a good idea! Moeka-san is a lab mem too!"
UNSPOKEN: Daru and Kurisu don’t object either.
Itaru: "So, what sorta mail does Kiryu-shi plan to send?"
Rintaro: "My request is that its contents be simple and easy to measure, so that we can confirm whether or not the past changes."
UNSPOKEN: A new mail. Why does she have to explain every little thing with a mail? No, more importantly...
Rintaro: "A secret? What do you mean?"
Kurisu: "What’s going on?"
Rintaro: "No, that’s not the problem."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu peeks at my phone from beside me.
Kurisu: "Hmmm, I see. I understand how you feel, but since this is an experiment, data collection should take priority."
Rintaro: "Oh? We agree for once, assistant."
Kurisu: "I-I’m not agreeing with you, exactly. If we don’t collect data, then we’ll never figure out how the PhoneWave works."
Mayuri: "But girls have lots of secrets, you know? You shouldn’t ask her to tell her secrets, Okarin. That’s perverted!"
Itaru: "Whoa! Is that where we’re going with this!?"
Rintaro: "Calm down, Daru!"
UNSPOKEN: I turn to Mayuri and Moeka, who appear to have formed some kind of mainstream girl alliance.
Rintaro: "We’re not asking you to send something private."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu nods firmly at my words. Looks like she doesn’t intend to join the mainstream girl alliance.
Kurisu: "Even if you want to send something private, you shouldn’t for now. We still don’t know how this thing handles paradoxes, so we need to be extremely careful."
Moeka: "...Nothing private?"
Kurisu: "Nothing you want to keep secret, at least. Even if you mean well, the mail’s content might have a serious effect on the timeline. You should show your mail to a third party and have them check if the content is problematic or not."
Rintaro: "Indeed. My assistant said everything I wanted to say. I will add only that the experiment must go on!"
Kurisu: "...I wasn’t speaking for you. Don’t misunderstand."
UNSPOKEN: Cheeky little...
Kurisu: "Experiments prioritize data over privacy in the first place. If you’re going to be a test subject, you need to be prepared for that."
