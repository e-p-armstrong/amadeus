Kurisu: "You don’t have to apologize. I’m not criticizing you. It’s just how these things work."
UNSPOKEN: I imagine some people might take issue with that statement, but I’ll refrain from saying anything. I’d rather not get my head chewed off right now. Moeka’s expression doesn’t change. Same as always. I don’t know what she’s thinking.
Rintaro: "You’re a lab mem. You need to trust us. Save private information for another day. If you can’t... then I’ll be forced to show you what lies dormant inside of the great Hououin Kyouma -- the terrible power of insanity!"
UNSPOKEN: Moeka is already typing on her phone. My threat was ineffectual, it seems.
Rintaro: "Well, I can show you my arrival history."
Moeka: "...And the send history?"
Rintaro: "Don’t have one. The send history disappears after you send the email."
UNSPOKEN: I confirmed that after I sent that D-Mail yesterday. Moeka was there, but she doesn’t remember either. Looks like she understands. I show the mail to Kurisu too.
Mayuri: "You don’t have to if you don’t want to, Moeka-san."
UNSPOKEN: Is that supposed to be encouragement? Mayuri sounds concerned for some reason.
Itaru: "So, whatcha gonna send? Okarin wants us to change the past in an easy-to-measure way, but that’s setting the bar way too high."
Rintaro: "Nonsense. You’re all just aiming too low."
Moeka: "I... have an idea."
UNSPOKEN: Moeka murmurs.
Rintaro: "Oh? This could be good. Give us the details."
UNSPOKEN: Moeka then invokes her power once more. Ultra-fast typing. The power known as Shining Finger.
Rintaro: "Excellent, Shining Finger! You’re a model lab mem!"
UNSPOKEN: This should make it easy to tell whether the past has changed. Looks like the three useless members have no objections to Moeka’s superior idea. We look at Moeka’s phone. It’s purple and gaudy. There’s no strap, and it’s not like the deco phones popular among mainstream women nowadays.
Itaru: "Oh, that’s the GG01 that just came out last month."
Mayuri: "Gee Gee Zero One?"
Itaru: "The latest model. Pretty sure the screen is detachable, so you can swap out attachments for it. It’s in short supply right now, so you need to be placed on a waitlist. Nice job getting one."
UNSPOKEN: It’s the most popular model, but she wants her old one back? I guess hardcore phone users have other concerns besides fashion.
Rintaro: "So, Finger."
Mayuri: "Um, why do you call Moeka-san ’Finger’?"
Rintaro: "That’s the name of her esper power. Kiryu Moeka, I dub thee Shining Finger! Use this name with pride."
UNSPOKEN: Moeka shakes her head expressionlessly.
Rintaro: "What? You don’t like it? But it’s such a cool name. What’s the problem!?"
Mayuri: "Moeka-san is Moeka-san. Her fingers don’t shine or anything..."
