Rintaro: Th-that naming sense... it's got to be Daru!
Mayuri: And FG probably stands for Future Gadget.
UNSPOKEN: So Suzuha's time machine... is Future Gadget No. 204!?
Mayuri: Finally, his name. Barrel Titor has to be Daru-kun!
Kurisu: Come to think of it, last night, Mayuri asked how to say 'barrel' in Japanese.
Mayuri: Barrel is 'taru' in Japanese. Right, Chris-chan?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu nods.
Rintaro: Taru... Taru... Daru!?
Suzuha: It's a pun!?
Mayuri: Okay, Suzu-san! Say 'Hashida Itaru' ten times fast!
Suzuha: Wh-why?
Mayuri: Just say it and find out! Ehehe!
Suzuha: HashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaru[linebreak]HashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaru
Mayuri: Just now, didn't it sound like 'Ditor'?
Kurisu: It did.
Mayuri: Hashidaitaru. Hashi-daita-ru. Hashi-Ditor-ru. Hashi-Titor-ru.
Itaru: ...For reals?
Mayuri: For super reals♪
UNSPOKEN: I can't believe it. But with all this evidence laid out in front of me, I can't deny it either. Everyone's jaw drops again, only this time we're staring at Daru and Suzuha.
Mayuri: I think she looks just like her father♪
Kurisu: That could just be the placebo effect... but now that you mention it, they kinda do look alike.
Rintaro: Nice work, Mayuri! You'll make a great detective one day.
Mayuri: A d-detective? Ehehe! That's the first time anyone's said that.
UNSPOKEN: She's such a ditz most of the time, but maybe she's more perceptive than anyone knows.
Itaru: My... d-daughter? Amane-shi is my daughter?
UNSPOKEN: Daru, wide-eyed, points at Suzuha while flapping his lips like a fish out of water.
Suzuha: Dad...
Itaru: Uh... c-c-could you call me Papa instead?
Kurisu: For once in your life, don't be a perv...
