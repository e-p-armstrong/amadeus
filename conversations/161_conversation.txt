Mayuri: Okarin? Does it hurt?
Rintaro: No... I'm okay now.
UNSPOKEN: I stand up. Then I shoot Kurisu a sharp glare.
Kurisu: W-what? That was just an act, right?
Rintaro: You are wrong, Christina. Our experiments have already proven... That I... That my Reading Steiner is genuine!
Kurisu: Fine, I get it. You're a chuunibyou patient.
Itaru: Eh?
Mayuri: Hm?
Kurisu: Ah... Wh-why are you all staring at me? Don't look at me!
UNSPOKEN: In any case, I've successfully deflected Kurisu's questions about Reading Steiner. I don't feel able to answer right now. My emotions are a jumble, just as they were after Titor called me the Messiah. An unknown power sleeps within me. The thought sends a chill down my spine. I sit on the bench in front of the Braun Tube Workshop, staring into the night sky. I try sorting out what happened this afternoon. But it's impossible. The more I think about it, the more confused I get. And then I hear footsteps coming down from the second floor. Soon, Mayuri and Kurisu emerge.
Rintaro: Going home?
Mayuri: Yup.
Kurisu: Do you always stay the night here?
Rintaro: Pretty much. I wouldn't be a true mad scientist if I couldn't stay overnight at my lab, immersed in research.
Kurisu: I think you're putting too much emphasis on appearances.
Mayuri: But you know, this place is really convenient. Mayushii would stay over if mom and dad let me.
Kurisu: Y-you would?
Mayuri: And it's so close to work too♪ Hey, Chris-chan, why don't we all stay over some time?
Kurisu: Sure, if the guys aren't around.
Rintaro: That won't happen.
Kurisu: Then why don't you come to my hotel, Mayuri-san?
Mayuri: Oh yeah, we did make that promise, huh? Ehehe! Then let's do that next time♪
Kurisu: You can come whenever you like. See you tomorrow.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu waves goodbye and starts walking in the opposite direction from Akihabara Station. Mayuri doesn't move from that spot. Instead, she starts doing her usual thing -- Stardust Handshake. She looks up to the night sky, raising her hand as if to grasp the stars. And with perfect timing, a shooting star crosses the sky.
Mayuri: ...Hey, Okarin.
Rintaro: Yeah. A shooting star. Did you make a wish?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri doesn't answer. She keeps gazing at the sky.
Mayuri: Remember how back in elementary school, you got a terrible fever and stayed in bed for a month?
Rintaro: Why are you bringing this up?
