Rintaro: Heh, something like that could never kill me! Ten years ago, I was already a mad scientist with an IQ of 170, equaling that of Thomas Edison!
UNSPOKEN: Actually, I'm not sure what Edison's IQ was.
Mayuri: Really? That's amazing! But Mayushii was still really small, and didn't know that, so I prayed to the sky. And then, on New Year's Eve, right before midnight, a shooting star went pewww across the sky. Just like now. If you repeat your wish three times before a shooting star disappears, your wish will come true. Did you know that?
UNSPOKEN: Of course. That's the most common of common knowledge.
Mayuri: It was hard, but Mayushii repeated her wish three times.
UNSPOKEN: Then Mayuri finally lowers her hand and turns to me. On her face is a soft smile.
Mayuri: The next day, on New Years, your fever went down, and you woke up. So basically, Mayushii saved your life! Ehehe!
Rintaro: No. It was simply the choice of Steins Gate.
Mayuri: Ehh? Really?
Rintaro: Really.
Mayuri: Oh...
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri looks a little disappointed.
Mayuri: Hey. Remember what you said when your fever went down? You said everything went blurry and twisty like, and the ground shook so bad you couldn't stand. Remember?' You were acting kind of like that just now. Are you okay? You're not coming down with a fever, are you?
UNSPOKEN: The concern on her face is so sincere. Looks like she's worried about my reaction to Moeka's disappearance. Geez. My hostage is worrying about me. I find myself giving her a wry smile.
Rintaro: I'm fine. Don't worry about a thing.
UNSPOKEN: As I brush her worry off with a shrug, I think back to what happened ten years ago. When I woke up from that fever, the first thing I saw was Mayuri's crying face. She's right. I vaguely remember describing my collapse that way. And come to think of it, it does seem to match with the sensation I felt a few hours ago when Reading Steiner activated.
Rintaro: I see! So this power was already mine back then! Muhahaha!
UNSPOKEN: So that's the choice of Steins Gate! I really was born with this power! No wonder John Titor thinks I'm the Messiah! My maniacal laughter echoes into the night. The next day, the lab gets an unusual guest.
Luka: Pardon the intrusion...
Itaru: Oh, if it isn't Luka-shi.
Luka: Hello, Hashida-san, Okabe-san.
Rintaro: Lukako! You don't have Demon Sword Samidare with you! What is the meaning of this!?
Luka: Eh, eh, eh?
Rintaro: I even unsealed the treasured heirloom sword Mistilteinn when I heard you were coming today. I'm disappointed in you.
UNSPOKEN: Actually, I didn't know he was coming.
Luka: I'm sorry! Um, I'll go back and get it.
Rintaro: No, that's okay. It was not Mistilteinn's fate to encounter Samidare this day.
