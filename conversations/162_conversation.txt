Rintaro: "Kiryu Moeka!"
UNSPOKEN: Daru and Kurisu give me strange looks as well.
Itaru: "Who’s that?"
Kurisu: "Never heard of her."
Rintaro: "...No way."
UNSPOKEN: So I did erase Moeka’s existence... No... that can’t be. I won’t accept that I killed her!
Kurisu: "Did it happen again, Okabe?"
Rintaro: "What do you mean, ’again’?"
Kurisu: "Something like this happened yesterday. You remembered something we didn’t. Uh, what did you call it? Oh yeah, Reading Steiner."
UNSPOKEN: Yes, that’s the name I gave this phenomenon -- or rather, to my ability to perceive it. When the worldline changes, everyone’s memories are reconstructed to match. That’s what John Titor said. But somehow, I alone retain my memories even after the past changes. I named this power Reading Steiner. Kurisu remembered. To tell the truth, I just made it up out of thin air. But now that Moeka has disappeared, I want to believe that this power is real. It’s only their memories of Moeka that disappeared! Not Moeka herself! I need to contact Moeka. I need to make sure I didn’t erase her very existence. But I don’t know her phone number. The only way to contact her is by mail. I send her a message saying Reply the second you read this email. Now all I can do is wait for her reply. Please, reply...
Mayuri: "Are you okay? You’re really pale."
Rintaro: "Y-yeah... I’m fine."
UNSPOKEN: In fact, I’m anything but fine. I’m fighting desperately to deny the possibility that I might have erased Moeka from existence.
Rintaro: "...Assistant, how much do you remember about the experiment we just did?"
Kurisu: "I don’t remember doing any experiments today. You sent a D-Mail just now, didn’t you?"
Rintaro: "...Yeah. But things are different from yesterday. I didn’t send the D-Mail. Kiryu Moeka did."
