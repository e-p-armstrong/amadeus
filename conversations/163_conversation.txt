Itaru: But a Japanese sword and a cursed sword from Norse mythology are so mismatched it's not even funny. Do we even have a sword here?
Luka: What should I...
Rintaro: Lukako, though you are my disciple, you still lack dedication.
Luka: I-I'm sorry!
Rintaro: At this rate, it will take some time before you can be useful. By the way, why not join our lab?
Luka: Eh, me?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako looks at me blankly.
Luka: But I'm clumsy, and I'm not good at science or engineering... I'll probably just get in your way... Do you really want me?
Rintaro: Don't sweat it. Mayuri's the same.
Mayuri: We'd love to have you, Luka-kun! But you know, if Luka-kun's gonna be a lab mem, then Mayushii has one condition for Okarin. Don't tease Luka-kun.
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri forces her way between us as if to protect Lukako. She's the one who called Lukako here. They're classmates.
Mayuri: And today, Luka-kun is Mayushii's guest. He came for a fitting session, so don't get in our way.
Luka: But Mayuri-chan, I don't really want to cosplay... Um, can it really just be a fitting session?
Mayuri: Yup. We're just making sure the size matches!
UNSPOKEN: Looks like Mayuri forced him to come. As far as she's concerned, pretty boys exist only to make her cosplay fantasies come true.
Mayuri: Tadah♪
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri shows off the costume she made.
Mayuri: This is a costume of Kirari-chan from RaiNet!
UNSPOKEN: Is it just my imagination, or is that outfit pretty skimpy? I don't know if it's his first time seeing it, but Lukako just stares at the costume dumbfounded.
Mayuri: Anyway, I'd say it's about 70% complete, but I want Luka-kun to try it on now♪
Luka: Try it on? Here?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako glances at me and Daru, then looks down to hide a blush.
Luka: I can't...
Mayuri: Please?
UNSPOKEN: Hmm... here's where I, as Lukako's master, ought to help out.
Rintaro: Listen, my pupil. To change your clothes is to change your very being. This costume might help you grow stronger. Put it on at once!
Luka: You're on her side? I just... can't wear something so embarrassing!
Rintaro: It's only embarrassing because you think it is.
Mayuri: That's right! I'm sure you'll be really cute♪
Rintaro: Besides, Mayuri worked very hard to make this costume so you could wear it. She sacrificed her sleeping time, her favorite banana nourishment time, and her Juicy Chicken Number One time just so she could sew and sew and sew. You can't let effort like that go to waste.
Luka: That's true, but...
UNSPOKEN: The good-natured Lukako is already bending to the power of my words.
Mayuri: Come on, Luka-kun! Transform! Tra-ns-form♪
