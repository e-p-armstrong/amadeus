Kurisu: "...I don’t know. No one has experienced a time paradox, after all."
Rintaro: "But before, didn’t you say something like the world would disappear?"
Kurisu: "All I said was that that was one theory. Maybe nothing happens, and like in a certain movie, history gets amended to accommodate the paradox. According to Dr. Hawking’s chronology protection conjecture, it’s impossible to do anything that might cause a time paradox in the first place."
UNSPOKEN: So all we have are theories...
Mayuri: "Um, Mayushii doesn’t really understand... But we’re all fine now, right? I don’t think that paradox thing happened. Mayushii doesn’t know who Moeka-san is, but I’m sure she’s okay too♪"
Itaru: "That’s Mayu-shi for you. A cute dumb girl."
Mayuri: "Ehh? Mayushii’s not dumb!"
UNSPOKEN: I’m amazed that Mayuri and Daru can have such a carefree conversation despite all that’s happened. They don’t realize the gravity of the situation. We might have erased someone’s very existence! In fact, if Moeka really has vanished, then that means the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is also responsible for the mass disappearance phenomenon I witnessed in Akihabara. What if I erased all those people? I don’t want to consider such a frightening possibility, so I desperately shake the thought out of my head.
Rintaro: "...!"
UNSPOKEN: A mail! Is it Moeka!? I check the mail with hope in my heart.
Rintaro: "...Ha, haha."
UNSPOKEN: My body goes limp from relief. A reply. She sent a reply. Moeka still exists. She didn’t disappear. Relief washes away my fear. My eyes fill with tears. Not because I was worried for Moeka, but because I thought I might be responsible for the horror of erasing someone’s existence.
Kurisu: "Explain what happened, Okabe."
UNSPOKEN: Urged by Kurisu, I explain everything that just happened.
Kurisu: "Hmmm. ...Honestly, I’m not surprised she disappeared from the lab."
Rintaro: "What do you mean?"
Kurisu: "I don’t know the details, but when the past changed, Kiryu-san’s actions these past four days changed ever so slightly. As a result, the timeline was reconfigured so that Moeka-san didn’t come to the lab today."
UNSPOKEN: So that’s why it looked like she teleported? I’m reminded of the teleporting gelbana, but I guess it’s not the same thing. Moeka didn’t become a jellyman, after all.
Itaru: "Is that even possible?"
Kurisu: "I don’t know. If the fact that the D-Mail was sent is undone, then it becomes a paradox of who sent that D-Mail... And there’s one other thing that I don’t understand."
Rintaro: "What?"
Kurisu: "What you call Reading Steiner. By the way, you should quit it with that name. It’s stupid."
Rintaro: "Hmph, I didn’t ask for your opinion."
