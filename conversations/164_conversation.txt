UNSPOKEN: Mayuri grabs Lukako's arm and drags him to the changing room.
Mayuri: Okay! Don't be shy! Now take off your clothes.
Luka: Wahh! Mayuri-chan, please don't touch me there! I'll change by myself! Please wait outside!
Mayuri: But it's a little tricky putting this on. Mayushii will teach you all the steps♪
Luka: Hyeeehhh, please don't undress me!
Itaru: It's so... yuri.
Rintaro: That's not yuri. Lukako's a guy.
Itaru: Then it's reverse rape!? Whoa, that's downright criminal!
UNSPOKEN: His imagination knows no bounds. A few minutes pass and out comes Mayuri first. She looks satisfied.
Mayuri: Come on, Luka-kun! Don't be shy.
UNSPOKEN: Lukako doesn't make an appearance, even when Mayuri calls him.
Mayuri: Luka-kun?
UNSPOKEN: Finally, a nervous Lukako comes out of the dressing room. Lukako looks like he's about to cry. I can already see the tears forming. I-isn't that skirt a little too short? Those bare legs are truly captivati... wait, oh god, oh god! I'm looking at a guy's legs! What the hell am I saying!? Why are his legs shaved!? What's going on here, Lukako!?
Mayuri: Waaahh! Luka-kun finally wore one of my outfits!
Luka: I-it's so embarrassing... I'm a guy... I shouldn't be dressing like this...
Mayuri: You know what they say. Cuteness is Justice♪
Luka: I don't know what you mean!
Itaru: Excellent work as usual. The clothes and the model bring out the best in each other. As far as 3D goes, Faris-tan is supreme, but Luka-shi almost makes me wanna become a low angler.
Mayuri: What about you, Okarin?
Rintaro: Ah, yeah, well...
UNSPOKEN: When urged to talk, I nod vaguely. I'm fascinated... but it's mortifying to admit that. Lukako is Lukako, yet Lukako is a man. Male. A man just shouldn't be fascinated by another man. I whip out my phone and put it to my ear.
Rintaro: It's me! My sanity is under attack! No, it's not the Organization. It's a descendent... of one of the town's... guardian miko! Guh! It's... infecting my soul! To think... Akiba had... such a powerful guardian! If we can harness this power... we can counteract the Organization's corrupting influence. ...I know. We can't hand the town over to those bastards just yet. This, too, is the choice of Steins Gate... El Psy Kongroo!
UNSPOKEN: I catch my breath, put away my phone, and turn back and smile at Lukako and the others who are staring blankly at me.
Rintaro: Whew... Lukako. Foolish disciple of mine. From now on, you shall go into battle equipped with that costume and Samidare.
