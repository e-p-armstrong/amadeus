Itaru: "Like an imaginary girlfriend. I get it."
Rintaro: "No you don’t. I’m not a ’gentleman perv’ like you, creating imaginary relationships."
Kurisu: "Maybe this Kiryu-san never existed. Or maybe Kiryu-san does exist, but the fact that she sent a D-Mail was something you made--"
Rintaro: "Gwaaaah!"
Kurisu: "...eh?"
UNSPOKEN: I fall to my knees and press my hand against my left eye.
Rintaro: "Ugh, ggh... my left eye, Reading Steiner, it aches!"
Mayuri: "Okarin, are you okay?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri peeks anxiously at my face. But I lightly push her aside.
Rintaro: "No, Mayuri! S-stay away! I don’t... want to hurt you!"
Mayuri: "But Okarin, you look like you’re in pain..."
Itaru: "...He’s messing with us, right?"
Kurisu: "Y-yeah..."
Rintaro: "I-I’m okay... This aching is normal... it’ll end soon! As long as I have this magic eye... the Organization will keep coming after me! It’s the power to see across time and space... but at the same time, it’s a double-edged sword! Because of this all-seeing eye... I have lost my connection to causality. I drift alone in the space between worlds. But even so... I swore to protect this lab! So quiet thy fury, Reading Steiner! Your time will come... but not yet."
UNSPOKEN: I kneel and press my head against the floor. And then I take a deep breath, and gradually remove my hand from my left eye. Mayuri rubs my back.
Mayuri: "Okarin? Does it hurt?"
Rintaro: "No... I’m okay now."
UNSPOKEN: I stand up. Then I shoot Kurisu a sharp glare.
Kurisu: "W-what? That was just an act, right?"
Rintaro: "You are wrong, Christina. Our experiments have already proven... That I... That my Reading Steiner is genuine!"
Kurisu: "Fine, I get it. You’re a chuunibyou patient."
Itaru: "Eh?"
Mayuri: "Hm?"
Kurisu: "Ah... Wh-why are you all staring at me? Don’t look at me!"
UNSPOKEN: In any case, I’ve successfully deflected Kurisu’s questions about Reading Steiner. I don’t feel able to answer right now. My emotions are a jumble, just as they were after Titor called me the Messiah. An unknown power sleeps within me. The thought sends a chill down my spine. I sit on the bench in front of the Braun Tube Workshop, staring into the night sky. I try sorting out what happened this afternoon. But it’s impossible. The more I think about it, the more confused I get. And then I hear footsteps coming down from the second floor. Soon, Mayuri and Kurisu emerge.
Rintaro: "Going home?"
Mayuri: "Yup."
Kurisu: "Do you always stay the night here?"
Rintaro: "Pretty much. I wouldn’t be a true mad scientist if I couldn’t stay overnight at my lab, immersed in research."
Kurisu: "I think you’re putting too much emphasis on appearances."
Mayuri: "But you know, this place is really convenient. Mayushii would stay over if mom and dad let me."
