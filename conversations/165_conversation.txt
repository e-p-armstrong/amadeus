UNSPOKEN: The word drops on my heart like an anvil. My knees give out. I collapse to the pavement. Suicide.
Tennouji: She hung herself at home. I was the one who found her.
UNSPOKEN: My life was meaningless. I recall the last words she wrote in her letter. Words of unimaginable despair. She didn't deserve so bleak an end.
Tennouji: She became unstable about a year before it happened. Before that, she was a nice, cheerful lady. This building was hers. She gave me a place to stay. She had no relatives, you know. Almost no one came to her funeral. It was a sad thing to see. She handed me that letter a week before it happened. Told me to give it to a young man named Okabe Rintaro on this exact date. When you moved in upstairs, I thought Suzu-san must've seen the future or something.
UNSPOKEN: Enough. I can't take it anymore. I try to stand, but my legs betray me. I stumble, but before I fall, a small body supports my shoulder.
Mayuri: Okarin, are you okay?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri. It must be taking all her strength to hold me up. Did Mayuri hear how Suzuha died? Her eyes are wet. Her lips are trembling. Still, she's the one supporting me. Mayuri and I bow deeply to Mister Braun and return to the lab. When we get back, Daru is seated at his computer, head on the table. Kurisu is standing in front of the TV, watching an excited reporter talk about Radi-Kan. The disappearance of the satellite is huge news, obviously. The lounge is silent, save for the TV. I look at the table. The divergence meter still reads 0. 337187%. It hasn't changed since before Suzuha left. What went wrong? I can't go back 10 years with the Time Leap Machine. I can't do anything about Suzuha's death. Should I have stopped her from leaving after all? Maybe then this tragedy wouldn't have happened. No. What choice did I have? I can't save Mayuri without the IBN 5100. Suzuha had to travel to 1975. I consider my options. What if I redo these two days again? Could Daru fix the time machine so this doesn't happen? Is fixing the time machine even possible? Daru's skills are second to none, and the time machine was built by his own hand, 26 years in the future. It seems logical that he would be able to fix it. But look at it another way. It took Daru twenty-six years to learn enough to build the time machine, and he had to reverse-engineer SERN's to do it. Maybe it's unreasonable to expect our Daru to perform flawless repairs in only two days. In that case, can I have Daru use the Time Leap Machine and repeat these two days until he repairs it? No. He'll have to start from scratch each time. Two days just aren't enough. I collapse onto the sofa and bury my face in my hands. Mayuri sits next to me and gently rubs my back. I'm grateful for her kindness. I recall what Suzuha wrote. If you can go back to that day, please, please let me leave. ...The D-Mail I sent. Could that be the cause? On the original worldline, Suzuha leapt to 1975 after failing to meet her father. Unsatisfied with that outcome, I sent a D-Mail to convince myself to follow Suzuha and prevent her from leaving. As a result, she remained in 2010 for an additional four days. But that night, the time machine was damaged by a thunderstorm. If I hadn't followed Suzuha that day... If I hadn't sent that D-Mail to myself... Her time machine would not have malfunctioned. She would have arrived safely in 1975. The solution is obvious. I need to cancel that D-Mail. But can I really do that? If I change the past so that Suzuha leaves, won't that undo the four days we spent together? Our frantic search through the streets of Akiba. Her heartfelt confession on the roof of Radi-Kan. Her tearful reunion with her father, Daru. All of it will be undone. What do I do? An urgent bulletin pops up on the TV. I look up in surprise. Bomb threat suspends Yamanote, Sobu, Keihin-Tohoku Lines. Damn. Moeka's men will be here any minute. There's no time to think. No time to hesitate. I run downstairs, break into the Braun Tube Workshop, and turn on the 42-inch CRT. Then I return to the lab and activate the Time Leap Machine.
Kurisu: What are you doing, Okabe!?
