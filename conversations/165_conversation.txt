Mayuri: "And it’s so close to work too♪ Hey, Chris-chan, why don’t we all stay over some time?"
Kurisu: "Sure, if the guys aren’t around."
Rintaro: "That won’t happen."
Kurisu: "Then why don’t you come to my hotel, Mayuri-san?"
Mayuri: "Oh yeah, we did make that promise, huh? Ehehe! Then let’s do that next time♪"
Kurisu: "You can come whenever you like. See you tomorrow."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu waves goodbye and starts walking in the opposite direction from Akihabara Station. Mayuri doesn’t move from that spot. Instead, she starts doing her usual thing -- Stardust Handshake. She looks up to the night sky, raising her hand as if to grasp the stars. And with perfect timing, a shooting star crosses the sky.
Mayuri: "...Hey, Okarin."
Rintaro: "Yeah. A shooting star. Did you make a wish?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri doesn’t answer. She keeps gazing at the sky.
Mayuri: "Remember how back in elementary school, you got a terrible fever and stayed in bed for a month?"
Rintaro: "Why are you bringing this up?"
UNSPOKEN: It was about ten years ago, at the turn of the century, when the world was in an uproar over Y2K. Near the end of 1999, I had a fever of nearly 40-degrees-C that lasted about a month. I didn’t recover until the new year. At least, that what I’ve been told. I don’t remember it myself. According to my parents, I was unconscious the whole time, tossing and turning. The doctors said it was a miracle I didn’t die. Because of that fever, I didn’t get to experience the millennium countdown event. They never figured out what caused it either.
Mayuri: "I was so afraid that Okarin might die. So Granny and I prayed to the sky together. ’Don’t die, Okarin.’"
Rintaro: "Heh, something like that could never kill me! Ten years ago, I was already a mad scientist with an IQ of 170, equaling that of Thomas Edison!"
UNSPOKEN: Actually, I’m not sure what Edison’s IQ was.
Mayuri: "Really? That’s amazing! But Mayushii was still really small, and didn’t know that, so I prayed to the sky. And then, on New Year’s Eve, right before midnight, a shooting star went pewww across the sky. Just like now. If you repeat your wish three times before a shooting star disappears, your wish will come true. Did you know that?"
UNSPOKEN: Of course. That’s the most common of common knowledge.
Mayuri: "It was hard, but Mayushii repeated her wish three times."
UNSPOKEN: Then Mayuri finally lowers her hand and turns to me. On her face is a soft smile.
Mayuri: "The next day, on New Years, your fever went down, and you woke up. So basically, Mayushii saved your life! Ehehe!"
Rintaro: "No. It was simply the choice of Steins Gate."
Mayuri: "Ehh? Really?"
Rintaro: "Really."
Mayuri: "Oh..."
