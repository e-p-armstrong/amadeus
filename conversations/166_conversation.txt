UNSPOKEN: The concern on her face is so sincere. Looks like she’s worried about my reaction to Moeka’s disappearance. Geez. My hostage is worrying about me. I find myself giving her a wry smile.
Rintaro: "I’m fine. Don’t worry about a thing."
UNSPOKEN: As I brush her worry off with a shrug, I think back to what happened ten years ago. When I woke up from that fever, the first thing I saw was Mayuri’s crying face. She’s right. I vaguely remember describing my collapse that way. And come to think of it, it does seem to match with the sensation I felt a few hours ago when Reading Steiner activated.
Rintaro: "I see! So this power was already mine back then! Muhahaha!"
UNSPOKEN: So that’s the choice of Steins Gate! I really was born with this power! No wonder John Titor thinks I’m the Messiah! My maniacal laughter echoes into the night. The next day, the lab gets an unusual guest.
Luka: "Pardon the intrusion..."
Itaru: "Oh, if it isn’t Luka-shi."
Luka: "Hello, Hashida-san, Okabe-san."
Rintaro: "Lukako! You don’t have Demon Sword Samidare with you! What is the meaning of this!?"
Luka: "Eh, eh, eh?"
Rintaro: "I even unsealed the treasured heirloom sword Mistilteinn when I heard you were coming today. I’m disappointed in you."
UNSPOKEN: Actually, I didn’t know he was coming.
Luka: "I’m sorry! Um, I’ll go back and get it."
Rintaro: "No, that’s okay. It was not Mistilteinn’s fate to encounter Samidare this day."
UNSPOKEN: I look out the window with an expression of melancholy.
Itaru: "But a Japanese sword and a cursed sword from Norse mythology are so mismatched it’s not even funny. Do we even have a sword here?"
Luka: "What should I..."
Rintaro: "Lukako, though you are my disciple, you still lack dedication."
Luka: "I-I’m sorry!"
Rintaro: "At this rate, it will take some time before you can be useful. By the way, why not join our lab?"
Luka: "Eh, me?"
UNSPOKEN: Lukako looks at me blankly.
Luka: "But I’m clumsy, and I’m not good at science or engineering... I’ll probably just get in your way... Do you really want me?"
Rintaro: "Don’t sweat it. Mayuri’s the same."
Mayuri: "We’d love to have you, Luka-kun! But you know, if Luka-kun’s gonna be a lab mem, then Mayushii has one condition for Okarin. Don’t tease Luka-kun."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri forces her way between us as if to protect Lukako. She’s the one who called Lukako here. They’re classmates.
Mayuri: "And today, Luka-kun is Mayushii’s guest. He came for a fitting session, so don’t get in our way."
Luka: "But Mayuri-chan, I don’t really want to cosplay... Um, can it really just be a fitting session?"
