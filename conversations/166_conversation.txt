Rintaro: There's nothing to be embarrassed about. Just proclaim it to the world!
Kurisu: Well yeah, no wish is embarrassing compared to the idiotic wish for chaos to envelop the world or whatever.
Rintaro: You, assistant! What kind of person laughs at people's wishes!?
Mayuri: Um, Mayushii's wish is to eat a ton of of yummy food, and to cover the lab with Upa goods, and to get Luka-kun to wear my costumes--
Rintaro: I'm not asking you.
Mayuri: But Mayushii wants 'Shota in the Gate' to grant her wish too!
Itaru: 'Shota in the Gate'!? That mistake is god tier. Probably because it's so... naughty.
UNSPOKEN: We all ignore Daru. Lukako puts his hands to his mouth and casts his eyes down. The same gesture as a (female) junior confessing her love to a (male) senior underneath a cherry tree. Cuteness overload! Must resist!
Luka: I want... to be a girl.
Kurisu: ...What?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu is the first to react. Her expression is one of utter confusion. Well, that's only natural. Not even I expected that, so I accidentally swallowed my muhahaha.
Luka: I don't really... like how I look... I always thought... that if I were a girl... I could be a little more confident...
UNSPOKEN: So he has no confidence in himself. He's prettier than any girl here. And yet, he has no confidence. I'm well aware of the reason for this. It's because he's a guy!
Kurisu: Wait. Wait a second.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu starts rubbing her temples.
Kurisu: Umm, what did she say?
Rintaro: Heh, heh, heh. Assistant mine -- no, Christina!
Kurisu: I'm not your assistant, and I'm not Christina!
Rintaro: You've made a grave error!
Kurisu: I have?
Rintaro: Don't you understand? No, of course you don't. How could you, with impure thoughts clouding your eyes!
Kurisu: Wh-what do you mean?
Rintaro: Allow me to explain. You called Lukako here a 'weak and innocent girl.' But he's not a girl at all. He's a guy!
Kurisu: Is that some kind of joke?
Rintaro: It's not a joke, but the naked truth as described in the Akashic Records! Muhahaha!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks at Daru and Mayuri as if seeking help, but they nod with a knowing look in their eyes. As for Lukako himself, he's just hanging his head in shame.
Kurisu: ...Are you guys trolling me?
Rintaro: Eh?
Itaru: Eh?
Kurisu: ...Eh?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu suddenly turns away as if to avoid my gaze. Then she walks up to Lukako.
Kurisu: Is what Okabe says true?
Luka: Y-yes... I'm... a guy...
Kurisu: N-no way! Someone this cute can't be a boy!
Itaru: You've got it backwards. You're supposed to say 'Someone this cute can't be a girl.'
Kurisu: That's not what I meant.
