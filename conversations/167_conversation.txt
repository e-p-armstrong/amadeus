UNSPOKEN: Mayuri shows off the costume she made.
Mayuri: "This is a costume of Kirari-chan from RaiNet!"
UNSPOKEN: Is it just my imagination, or is that outfit pretty skimpy? I don’t know if it’s his first time seeing it, but Lukako just stares at the costume dumbfounded.
Mayuri: "Anyway, I’d say it’s about 70% complete, but I want Luka-kun to try it on now♪"
Luka: "Try it on? Here?"
UNSPOKEN: Lukako glances at me and Daru, then looks down to hide a blush.
Luka: "I can’t..."
Mayuri: "Please?"
UNSPOKEN: Hmm... here’s where I, as Lukako’s master, ought to help out.
Rintaro: "Listen, my pupil. To change your clothes is to change your very being. This costume might help you grow stronger. Put it on at once!"
Luka: "You’re on her side? I just... can’t wear something so embarrassing!"
Rintaro: "It’s only embarrassing because you think it is."
Mayuri: "That’s right! I’m sure you’ll be really cute♪"
Rintaro: "Besides, Mayuri worked very hard to make this costume so you could wear it. She sacrificed her sleeping time, her favorite banana nourishment time, and her Juicy Chicken Number One time just so she could sew and sew and sew. You can’t let effort like that go to waste."
Luka: "That’s true, but..."
UNSPOKEN: The good-natured Lukako is already bending to the power of my words.
Mayuri: "Come on, Luka-kun! Transform! Tra-ns-form♪"
Luka: "Eh, wait a sec, wahhhhhhh!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri grabs Lukako’s arm and drags him to the changing room.
Mayuri: "Okay! Don’t be shy! Now take off your clothes."
Luka: "Wahh! Mayuri-chan, please don’t touch me there! I’ll change by myself! Please wait outside!"
Mayuri: "But it’s a little tricky putting this on. Mayushii will teach you all the steps♪"
Luka: "Hyeeehhh, please don’t undress me!"
Itaru: "It’s so... yuri."
Rintaro: "That’s not yuri. Lukako’s a guy."
Itaru: "Then it’s reverse rape!? Whoa, that’s downright criminal!"
UNSPOKEN: His imagination knows no bounds. A few minutes pass and out comes Mayuri first. She looks satisfied.
Mayuri: "Come on, Luka-kun! Don’t be shy."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako doesn’t make an appearance, even when Mayuri calls him.
Mayuri: "Luka-kun?"
