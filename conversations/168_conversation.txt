Itaru: S-so that's how you reply... well played.
Kurisu: Wh-what are you talking about?
UNSPOKEN: Anyway, it sounds like an old wives' tale.
Mayuri: Really? I didn't know that. So Mayushii and Chris-chan's moms ate a lot of vegetables?
UNSPOKEN: Only Mayuri's impressed.
Mayuri: Mayushii only eats Juicy Chicken Number One, so will her future child be a boy? Hey, do you think bananas count as vegetables?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri is full of questions. I'll leave her to them.
Rintaro: But what about primitive people who lived on hunting? If that theory is true, then they would have had too many boys and not enough girls. Humanity would never have made it this far.
Kurisu: I never said it was true. I just remembered hearing it somewhere. Don't snap at every little thing.
Rintaro: I didn't snap. Christina, feel like verifying that theory?
Kurisu: ...What are you implying?
Rintaro: Have you forgotten? We have the PhoneWave (name subject to change)!
Mayuri: PhoneWave-chan? It can tell if you'll have a boy or a girl?
UNSPOKEN: No way in hell.
Kurisu: Wait... of course.
UNSPOKEN: Looks like Kurisu's got it. They don't call her a genius for nothing.
Kurisu: We can send a D-Mail to Urushibara-san's mother when she was pregnant.
Rintaro: Indeed. Something like 'Eat more vegetables!'
UNSPOKEN: Lukako, who doesn't know what D-Mails are, and Mayuri, who's just a little dumb, tilt their heads in confusion at the same time.
Rintaro: You think it's worth a shot?
Kurisu: Well...
Rintaro: It's too late to hide behind your goody-two-shoes mask, Christina. Your fate is to become a mad scientist, for you are an experiment-loving girl!
Kurisu: Who are you calling an experiment-loving girl!?
Rintaro: Am I wrong?
Kurisu: N-no, but...
UNSPOKEN: That settles it!
Itaru: Hold on, man! What are you going to do if the experiment works?
Rintaro: What do you mean?
Itaru: I mean, if Luka-shi's sex seriously changes.
Rintaro: That's what he wants, isn't it?
Itaru: Well, yeah, but... If his sex does change, won't the 16 years of his life change too? That's what I mean. Who's gonna take responsibility for that?
Rintaro: That's...
Luka: Um... I'll take responsibility...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako raises his hand timidly.
Itaru: Seriously?
Luka: Well, I don't really understand... but if we use this method, I might become a girl, right? Then... I want to try. Please, Master.
UNSPOKEN: He bows his head to me.
Rintaro: Mayuri, your opinion?
Mayuri: Hmm... If Luka-kun becomes a girl, then I've gotta call her Luka-chan! Will Luka-chan wear Mayushii's costumes?
Luka: Um, well, that's another story...
UNSPOKEN: At any rate, it doesn't look like Mayuri has any objections.
Rintaro: Then that settles it. Lukako, I appoint you Lab Mem 006.
Luka: Eh...?
Rintaro: The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is our lab's most important secret. In order to use it, you must become a lab mem.
