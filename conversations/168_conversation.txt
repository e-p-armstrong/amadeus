Luka: "I-it’s so embarrassing... I’m a guy... I shouldn’t be dressing like this..."
Mayuri: "You know what they say. Cuteness is Justice♪"
Luka: "I don’t know what you mean!"
Itaru: "Excellent work as usual. The clothes and the model bring out the best in each other. As far as 3D goes, Faris-tan is supreme, but Luka-shi almost makes me wanna become a low angler."
Mayuri: "What about you, Okarin?"
Rintaro: "Ah, yeah, well..."
UNSPOKEN: When urged to talk, I nod vaguely. I’m fascinated... but it’s mortifying to admit that. Lukako is Lukako, yet Lukako is a man. Male. A man just shouldn’t be fascinated by another man. I whip out my phone and put it to my ear.
Rintaro: "It’s me! My sanity is under attack! No, it’s not the Organization. It’s a descendent... of one of the town’s... guardian miko! Guh! It’s... infecting my soul! To think... Akiba had... such a powerful guardian! If we can harness this power... we can counteract the Organization’s corrupting influence. ...I know. We can’t hand the town over to those bastards just yet. This, too, is the choice of Steins Gate... El Psy Kongroo!"
UNSPOKEN: I catch my breath, put away my phone, and turn back and smile at Lukako and the others who are staring blankly at me.
Rintaro: "Whew... Lukako. Foolish disciple of mine. From now on, you shall go into battle equipped with that costume and Samidare."
Luka: "Eh..."
Mayuri: "Ehh? Kirari-chan doesn’t have a sword! He should carry an Upa instead♪"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri, in high spirits, makes Lukako hold the Upa cushion. His lips tremble as he reluctantly accepts the cushion. He clearly doesn’t know what to do with it.
Rintaro: "The Organization is making a move on Akiba."
UNSPOKEN: I pretend not to notice Lukako’s distress.
Rintaro: "You are the guardian who protects this chaotic metropolis. Miko of Yanabayashi Shrine, now is the time for you to fulfill that duty! Understand, Lukako? This is the reason I’m so hard on you. You have a duty to protect this town!"
Luka: "Do I... really?"
Rintaro: "You certainly do! Muhahaha!"
Kurisu: "Can you stop that vulgar laughter? I can hear you from outside. It’s embarrassing."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu enters the lab with those remarks. She’s coming in late, like she’s a company executive or something.
Mayuri: "Chris-chan, tutturu♪"
Rintaro: "Mmgh!? You come here this late and dare insult me? And you call yourself my assistant!?"
Kurisu: "I’m not your assistant. Don’t make me repeat myself. Anyway! You’re the worst, toying with such a weak and innocent girl. Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?"
