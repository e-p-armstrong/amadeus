Rintaro: "I didn’t snap. Christina, feel like verifying that theory?"
Kurisu: "...What are you implying?"
Rintaro: "Have you forgotten? We have the PhoneWave (name subject to change)!"
Mayuri: "PhoneWave-chan? It can tell if you’ll have a boy or a girl?"
UNSPOKEN: No way in hell.
Kurisu: "Wait... of course."
UNSPOKEN: Looks like Kurisu’s got it. They don’t call her a genius for nothing.
Kurisu: "We can send a D-Mail to Urushibara-san’s mother when she was pregnant."
Rintaro: "Indeed. Something like ’Eat more vegetables!’"
UNSPOKEN: Lukako, who doesn’t know what D-Mails are, and Mayuri, who’s just a little dumb, tilt their heads in confusion at the same time.
Rintaro: "You think it’s worth a shot?"
Kurisu: "Well..."
Rintaro: "It’s too late to hide behind your goody-two-shoes mask, Christina. Your fate is to become a mad scientist, for you are an experiment-loving girl!"
Kurisu: "Who are you calling an experiment-loving girl!?"
Rintaro: "Am I wrong?"
Kurisu: "N-no, but..."
UNSPOKEN: That settles it!
Itaru: "Hold on, man! What are you going to do if the experiment works?"
Rintaro: "What do you mean?"
Itaru: "I mean, if Luka-shi’s sex seriously changes."
Rintaro: "That’s what he wants, isn’t it?"
Itaru: "Well, yeah, but... If his sex does change, won’t the 16 years of his life change too? That’s what I mean. Who’s gonna take responsibility for that?"
Rintaro: "That’s..."
Luka: "Um... I’ll take responsibility..."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako raises his hand timidly.
Itaru: "Seriously?"
Luka: "Well, I don’t really understand... but if we use this method, I might become a girl, right? Then... I want to try. Please, Master."
UNSPOKEN: He bows his head to me.
Rintaro: "Mayuri, your opinion?"
Mayuri: "Hmm... If Luka-kun becomes a girl, then I’ve gotta call her Luka-chan! Will Luka-chan wear Mayushii’s costumes?"
Luka: "Um, well, that’s another story..."
UNSPOKEN: At any rate, it doesn’t look like Mayuri has any objections.
Rintaro: "Then that settles it. Lukako, I appoint you Lab Mem 006."
Luka: "Eh...?"
Rintaro: "The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is our lab’s most important secret. In order to use it, you must become a lab mem."
Luka: "Ah! Okay! Actually... I always wanted to be a lab member."
Mayuri: "Really? You should’ve just said so!"
Luka: "I didn’t have the courage... Like I said, I don’t know a thing about gadgets..."
Mayuri: "You don’t have to worry about those things. I mean, Mayuri doesn’t get them either."
UNSPOKEN: That’s not something to be proud of, Mayuri.
Rintaro: "So Lukako shall be a lab mem from this point forth. Any objections?"
Kurisu: "Here."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu raises her hand.
Kurisu: "I want to give Urushibara-san my number so I can retire."
