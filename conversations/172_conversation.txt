UNSPOKEN: Lukako looks at me with tears in his eyes, then nods faintly. The discharge phenomenon soon occurs. Lukako flinches and takes a step back, but then I see determination flare in his eyes. He sets his jaw... and pushes the enter button. A wave of dizziness hits me again. I place a hand on the table to support myself. The dizziness slowly fades. Little by little, color returns to the world.
Rintaro: Nn...
UNSPOKEN: Reading Steiner activated again. Did the worldline change? I look around the room. Unlike what happened with Moeka, Lukako's still here. He blushes when he notices my stare.
Luka: Um, Okabe-san, could you... please not look at me like that?
UNSPOKEN: I fold my arms and tilt my head. Lukako's appearance hasn't changed a bit. I'm paying particular attention to his chest. And his chest. And his chest. As a guy, it's natural for him to have no breasts. But if he's a girl now, then that's a different story. That washboard isn't tiny-breast level. It's no-breast level.
Rintaro: It... didn't work?
UNSPOKEN: So the eat lots of vegetables to give birth to a girl thing Kurisu talked about was nothing but fringe science. What kind of scientist believes such a flimsy theory anyway?
Mayuri: What didn't work?
UNSPOKEN: Everyone, including Lukako, looks at me in confusion.
Rintaro: Don't you remember? Just now, we used the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to--
UNSPOKEN: I slap a hand over my mouth as soon as I start talking. That was careless of me. As our previous experiments proved, the activation of Reading Steiner means that the worldline has changed. And I'm the only one who carries his memories through the change. Nobody else here knows what we did.
Rintaro: Sorry. It's nothing.
UNSPOKEN: Afterwards, Mayuri and Lukako happily go out shopping for lunch at a neighborhood convenience store.
Rintaro: Christina. I want to ask you something. Is Lukako...
Kurisu: What pervy act are you thinking about this time? Can't be too careful around the perv duo.
Itaru: We're not a perv duo. We are a pervy gentlemen duo!
Kurisu: Whatever. Seriously, whatever.
Rintaro: Muh...
