Kurisu: W-what!? Don't be ridiculous! Why should I care!? I'm not worried about you, okay? Don't get the wrong idea. I just don't want to lose a valuable test subject, that's all. Yeah! That brain of yours has accumulated memories spanning worldlines and time leaps. It's a precious sample that can rewrite the history of neuroscience! I want to map your brain and find out just what's going on in there. In other words, your time leaping helps me, too! After all, the Time Leap Machine is the fruit of my research, so to speak, and I--
Rintaro: Calm down.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu turns away with a sour expression. This assistant of mine can be difficult sometimes. Anyway. I consider her hypothesis. In order to return to the worldline where I found the IBN 5100 at Yanabayashi Shrine, we need to cancel all the D-Mails we sent so far. The theory is sound, and I've got nothing else to go on. I check the clock. It's 6:42 PM. Only one hour until Moeka's raid. I decide to time leap once more, to the afternoon of the 13th, just before the Time Leap Machine is completed.
Rintaro: Christina. I'm going to give this plan of yours a shot.
Kurisu: Oh. G-great.
UNSPOKEN: I take Kurisu's hand and grasp it firmly.
Kurisu: Ah...
Rintaro: You've been a great help. Sorry for the trouble.
Kurisu: D-don't apologize, dummy. It's confusing... And besides, I don't even remember helping you before! How are you going to take responsibility for this!?
UNSPOKEN: Why is she getting mad at me? I just don't understand her.
Kurisu: I wish I could remember too... Then I'd always have something to rub your nose in!
Rintaro: You really have an awful personality.
Kurisu: You're one to talk.
