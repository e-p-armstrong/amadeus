Itaru: It's cool, but it's kinda lame at the same time.
Rintaro: What's lame about it?
Itaru: I couldn't use it to win my RaiNet match against Faris-tan.
UNSPOKEN: Now that's a selfish reason...
Rintaro: As our experiments have shown, D-Mail still hasn't reached a reliable level of precision. A true time machine must remove luck from the equation. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is useless unless we can somehow give the sender more control.
UNSPOKEN: For starters, there's the problem of how I'm the only one who can recognize the changes. Without my special power, we wouldn't even be able to check the results of the experiment. Ridiculous.
Itaru: Yeah, we aren't getting results. What about the LOTO SIX?
Rintaro: Pending.
UNSPOKEN: Although it was Lukako's mistake that cost us the prize, he wouldn't have been in a position to make that mistake if I hadn't asked him to buy the ticket in my stead. Why did I do that? It's as if Steins Gate guided the money away from my grasp. No. I need to think positive.
Rintaro: Hououin Kyouma will not let this keep him down. I won't give up. For I am a mad scientist!
Itaru: I don't understand what you're saying, but you sure seem confident about it.
Rintaro: Someday we will improve the PhoneWave (name subject to change) so that it may be used to send things not only to the past, but also to the future. We'll improve it. No, we must improve it! For that is the choice of Steins Gate! Muhahahaha!
Faris: A time machine!?
Rintaro: !!?
UNSPOKEN: Faris is standing right next to me. Where the hell did she come from?
Rintaro: Damn you, Faris! Eavesdropping is cowardly!
Faris: What do you mean? Your voice is so loud, it echoes through the whole store nya.
UNSPOKEN: Wha... no! Once again, I leaked classified information concerning the future of mankind!
Faris: Here's your iced coffee, and your iced tea and 'cat food'. Thanks for waiting, nyan♪
UNSPOKEN: Daru's order of cat food is one of this maid cafe's specialties. It's not the usual miso over rice, but a stylish risotto instead. It's one of Daru's favorites. It's actually pretty tasty. Faris places the ice coffee in front of me.
Faris: Do you want milk and syrup nyan?
Rintaro: NEVER.
Faris: If Kyouma's gonna be like that, I'll pour it all in nya! You need sugar for a healthy brain, nyan♪
UNSPOKEN: Despite my refusal, Faris pours all of the milk and syrup into my glass.
Faris: Nyan nyan, nyan nyan♪
UNSPOKEN: Then, speaking some nonsense incantation, she mixes my iced coffee with the straw. And the whole time, she stares straight into my eyes.
Itaru: There it is! Faris-tan's secret technique, 'Eye Contact Mix-Mix'!
UNSPOKEN: Daru starts explaining in excitement.
Itaru: Most maids can't do it without spilling a little, yet Faris-tan makes it look easy! That's why I love her! It's because of this secret technique that Faris-tan reigns supreme as MayQueen's number one maid!
