UNSPOKEN: I hear the door open and quickly cover Faris's mouth with my hand.
Viral Attacker A: Is Faris really hiding in here?
Viral Attacker B: Someone saw two people who looked like them go inside.
UNSPOKEN: Crap! Someone saw us!? We need to do something. If they call their friends, we're done for.
Rintaro: ...!
UNSPOKEN: Shit, not now! The Virals react to the ringtone.
Viral Attacker A: Where are you!?
Viral Attacker B: So you were here, Faris.
Rintaro: Yeah!?
Kurisu: Okabe! Can you hear me!? We called a taxi, but it'll take some time to get there.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu...
Rintaro: You exposed us to the pursuers. They're right in front of us!
Viral Attacker A: Hey, come out!
Viral Attacker B: There's no point in hiding!
Kurisu: I see. Then I'll lecture you on how to escape. You're in the same the place you were before, right?
UNSPOKEN: The men are approaching our hiding spot. But because the room is dark, it seems they can't tell where we are. I listen carefully to Kurisu's voice.
Kurisu: Scatter the flour and make a break for it. OK?
UNSPOKEN: Scatter the flour?
Kurisu: Then switch on the light.
