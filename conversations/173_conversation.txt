Kurisu: "...*sigh*"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri and Daru ask What happened to 005? but I ignore them. Moeka will always be 005 in my heart. No other objections emerge. All members are in favor.
Rintaro: "Very well. Lukako is officially Lab Mem Number 006. Henceforth, pledge your allegiance to the lab, and devote all your strength to the enrichment of our science."
Luka: "Y-yes! I will! I’m so happy."
Rintaro: "Now then, let’s begin the experiment immedia--"
UNSPOKEN: ...Wait. I suddenly realize something that makes me smack by forehead in dismay.
Rintaro: "Damn! Lukako, you’re 16, right?"
Luka: "Um... right."
Rintaro: "So you were born in 1993..."
Mayuri: "Yup! The same year as Mayushii. What about it?"
UNSPOKEN: In order to tell Lukako’s mother to eat a lot of vegetables, we need to send a D-Mail to ten months before Lukako was born, meaning we have to send it to 1992.
Rintaro: "When did cellphones become widespread in Japan!?"
Kurisu: "Ah..."
UNSPOKEN: Looks like Kurisu and Daru figured it out. Daru goes to google it.
Itaru: "Around 1996. There wasn’t mail until later, though."
Rintaro: "So the year Lukako was born, most people still didn’t have cellphones. Lukako’s mother may not have had one. In that case, she might not be able to receive the D-Mail!"
Mayuri: "Oh! I get it!"
Luka: "Eh...? We can’t do it?"
UNSPOKEN: Lukako’s face darkens. I fold my arms in thought. Some way to receive the email... in an era when cellphones weren’t yet widespread...
Itaru: "What about modifying it to send crazy waves or something?"
Kurisu: "What the hell are crazy waves?"
Itaru: "Waves that only crazy girls can pick up. You know, girls who always talk about stuff no one understands. It’s pretty moe."
Kurisu: "I’ll microwave your brain if you don’t shut up."
Itaru: "Yes! Abuse me more, please!"
Mayuri: "Um, couldn’t you put a letter in a time capsule and bury it?"
Kurisu: "That would go to the future, not the past."
Mayuri: "Oh..."
Itaru: "I know! How about that thing where you get struck by lightning and that turns you into a girl! Like in old comics and anime."
Kurisu: "There’s no point to the experiment if we don’t use D-Mail. Don’t lose sight of the objective."
Mayuri: "We’re counting on you for a nice idea, Chris-chan♪"
Kurisu: "M-me? I... We could... build a rocket which exceeds the speed of light squared, then that immense speed would reverse the flow of time, or something..."
Itaru: "You’re forgetting about the PhoneWave too."
Rintaro: "Furthermore, genius girl, you just contradicted relativity."
Kurisu: "It was just a joke. Don’t take it seriously."
Rintaro: "Useless, all of you! This lab is a disgrace!"
