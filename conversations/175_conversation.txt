Rintaro: So what you're saying is that the present is subjective to the observer.
Faris: If we go with that assumption, then the past and the future also depend on the observer, nyan. If Faris were to use a time machine to travel back one week, then Kyouma and Daru-nyan's present would become Faris's future, nya.
Itaru: I guess that makes sense...
Faris: So how does the leaf model reflect that difference, nya?
UNSPOKEN: Neither Daru nor I has an answer to that. Perhaps nobody has an answer. Just like the 'collapse of causality' thing that Kurisu mentioned. Does that mean that time machines and time travel are impossible after all? But SERN's gelified test subjects physically traveled as far back as 1921...
Faris: Anyway, if everything depends on the observer, then clocks are meaningless, nyan. Fun times fly, and hard times drag, nya. In other words, the flow of time changes depending on your point of view, nyan.
Itaru: Speaking of which, as you grow older, it feels like time starts to flow faster, doesn't it?
Rintaro: Janet's law...
Faris: Faris thinks about this stuff sometimes, nya. I think time might not be something as simple as a river, nyan.
Itaru: Yeah, the more you think about it, the more complicated it gets.
UNSPOKEN: The strict definition of time, similar to the question of Where is the self?, is one of humanity's eternal questions. Countless renowned scholars have left this question unanswered. There's no way amateurs like us can answer it. But there's one thing I can do.
Rintaro: Heh. Heh heh heh. Muhahaha!
Faris: Nyanya?
Rintaro: Fret not. Though physics and philosophy may deny us, our machine has made time travel possible! Am I correct, Daru!?
Itaru: Yeah. Yeah! That's right!
Faris: Nyaa... looks like you guys have kicked reason to the curb, nya. But Faris wants to use the time machine too, nya. Can I, please?
Itaru: Sure! I'll let you use it as much as you want, Faris-tan.
Faris: Really nya? Then it's a promise, nya!
Rintaro: Daru, don't decide things on your own!
UNSPOKEN: Faris springs up with joy and hugs Daru's rotund body. That's all it takes to make Daru look like he's died and gone to heaven. After killing some more time at MayQueen, I leave Daru and head back to the lab. When I arrive, I find Kurisu sitting on the bench in front of the Braun Tube Workshop, talking on her phone. 
Kurisu: What? You called me all the way to Japan, and now you-- ...I knew it. You never wanted to see me, did you? ...sniff.
UNSPOKEN: The street is dark and her hair is covering her eyes, so I can't make out her expression. But from the sound of her voice, I can tell that she's crying.
Kurisu: Why did you ask me to come here, then? Can you at least tell me tha--
