Mayuri: "Why 831?"
Itaru: "8(ya) 3(sa) 1(i) for veggies (yasai), duh. VEGGIES VEGGIES VEGGIES -- we just have to drill this into Luka-shi’s mother’s brain."
Rintaro: "She’ll just pass that message off as a prank."
Mayuri: "Then, how about ’29292929’?"
Rintaro: "I’m going to regret asking this, but what does that mean?"
Mayuri: "Ni(2) ku(9) for meat. MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT."
Rintaro: "Why do you want her to like meat!?"
Mayuri: "That’s not it! If you keep repeating ’MEAT’, then she’ll actually start to hate meat and want to eat vegetables instead, don’t you think?"
Itaru: "Yeah... no."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako completes his composition while we speak our nonsense.
Luka: "How about something like this? ’MOM EAT VEGGIES OK’"
Itaru: "Isn’t that a little too vague?"
Rintaro: "And the first ’MOM’ should go. That’ll just make it harder to believe."
Luka: "Then... ’EAT LOTS OF VEGGIES TO GIVE BIRTH TO A GIRL’."
Kurisu: "That’s a little too direct. And it’s over the character limit."
Luka: "’EAT VEGGIES FOR HEALTHY KID’"
Itaru: "Wait a sec. According to this conversion chart, it looks like you gotta use two more numbers for voiced consonants. So that sentence is four bytes over."
Rintaro: "Then a little modification. How about ’EAT VEG 4 HEALTHY KID’?"
Kurisu: "Isn’t that a little too informal? You’re talking to Urushibara-san’s mother, you know? Would she understand the ’VEG 4’ part?"
Rintaro: "You have any bright ideas?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu shrugs her shoulders and says no more. Then it’s settled.
Mayuri: "Come on, let’s type it out!"
UNSPOKEN: When sending to a pager, the number-encoded message is handled like a telephone number, so we enter the input into the X68000. The long, random-looking string of numbers is complete.
Rintaro: "Alright, we’re good to go."
UNSPOKEN: Now we just activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and have Lukako call. The microwave timer is set to 154152 seconds. It should arrive around January 1, 1993. The margin of error is around 1-3 days, I guess. Leap year calculation’s a pain, so I ignored it. Lukako’s slender finger starts to tremble on top of the enter button.
Rintaro: "Ready? I’m starting it up."
