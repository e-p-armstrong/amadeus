UNSPOKEN: Reading Steiner activated again. Did the worldline change? I look around the room. Unlike what happened with Moeka, Lukako’s still here. He blushes when he notices my stare.
Luka: "Um, Okabe-san, could you... please not look at me like that?"
UNSPOKEN: I fold my arms and tilt my head. Lukako’s appearance hasn’t changed a bit. I’m paying particular attention to his chest. And his chest. And his chest. As a guy, it’s natural for him to have no breasts. But if he’s a girl now, then that’s a different story. That washboard isn’t tiny-breast level. It’s no-breast level.
Rintaro: "It... didn’t work?"
UNSPOKEN: So the eat lots of vegetables to give birth to a girl thing Kurisu talked about was nothing but fringe science. What kind of scientist believes such a flimsy theory anyway?
Mayuri: "What didn’t work?"
UNSPOKEN: Everyone, including Lukako, looks at me in confusion.
Rintaro: "Don’t you remember? Just now, we used the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to--"
UNSPOKEN: I slap a hand over my mouth as soon as I start talking. That was careless of me. As our previous experiments proved, the activation of Reading Steiner means that the worldline has changed. And I’m the only one who carries his memories through the change. Nobody else here knows what we did.
Rintaro: "Sorry. It’s nothing."
UNSPOKEN: Afterwards, Mayuri and Lukako happily go out shopping for lunch at a neighborhood convenience store.
Rintaro: "Christina. I want to ask you something. Is Lukako..."
Kurisu: "What pervy act are you thinking about this time? Can’t be too careful around the perv duo."
Itaru: "We’re not a perv duo. We are a pervy gentlemen duo!"
Kurisu: "Whatever. Seriously, whatever."
Rintaro: "Muh..."
UNSPOKEN: Damn. I can’t ask now. It’s really annoying that no one remembers. I don’t want to think about how Kurisu might react if I suddenly ask Is Lukako a girl? I should wait until I can get Lukako alone, and check then. But considering how his appearance hasn’t changed at all, it’s very likely that the sex change failed. In that case, what did Lukako’s D-Mail change? It’s just like the Moeka experiment. The result is different from what we expected. The real problem... is that we have no control. After I leave the lab, I head to MayQueen+Nyan² to think. Daru sits in front of me, waiting impatiently for Faris to bring our order.
Rintaro: "Daru. What do you think about D-Mail?"
Itaru: "It’s cool, but it’s kinda lame at the same time."
Rintaro: "What’s lame about it?"
Itaru: "I couldn’t use it to win my RaiNet match against Faris-tan."
UNSPOKEN: Now that’s a selfish reason...
Rintaro: "As our experiments have shown, D-Mail still hasn’t reached a reliable level of precision. A true time machine must remove luck from the equation. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is useless unless we can somehow give the sender more control."
