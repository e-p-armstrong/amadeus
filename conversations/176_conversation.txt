Rintaro: Y-yeah?
Kurisu: I wasn't crying or anything, okay!?
Rintaro: No, you were definitely crying.
Kurisu: Don't be ridiculous! Where's your proof!?
Rintaro: Your eyes are red.
Kurisu: Ugh...
UNSPOKEN: Her glare weakens for a second, but then returns at double the intensity.
Kurisu: I wasn't crying, okay!?
Rintaro: You're not being very logical, Christina.
UNSPOKEN: In fact, she's not acting like herself at all. Did she come up here just to claim that she wasn't crying? She should have just gone back to her hotel and cried into a pillow instead of coming here to make excuses.
Kurisu: Anyway, I wasn't crying. Understand? End of discussion. Sniff.
UNSPOKEN: That sniffle tanked any credibility she might have had. Even now, instead of going back to her hotel, she plops onto the sofa and hugs Mayuri's Upa plushie to her chest like a little girl. For the next few minutes, she just sits there, pouting and staring at the wall. If the TV were on, then we could have a little BGM for some distraction, but unfortunately, painful silence prevails. The only sounds are the whirring of the desktop's hard drive and Kurisu's occasional sniffle. Geez, what an annoying assistant. How are we supposed to get any science done like this?
Rintaro: Christina.
Kurisu: Shut up. Don't talk to me.
UNSPOKEN: Your lips say don't, but your aura says please. Maybe she's begging for attention?
Rintaro: Listen. You don't have to talk. Just listen. If there's something troubling you, I'll do everything in my power to help.
Kurisu: ...Eh?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks at me blankly.
Rintaro: And it's not just me. I'm sure I speak for Mayuri and Daru as well. So don't hesitate to come to us. When you want to cry, don't hold it in. Just let it out. We won't reject you. We'll hear you out.
Kurisu: Why...
Rintaro: Because you're important to us. You're our friend.
Kurisu: Ah... yeah...
UNSPOKEN: For some reason, Kurisu blushes and hangs her head. She hugs Upa so hard, his face caves in.
Kurisu: ...I'm sorry. I was a little upset.
Rintaro: You don't have to tell me if you don't want to. Just tell me when you're ready. I'll hear you out.
Kurisu: ...Okay.
