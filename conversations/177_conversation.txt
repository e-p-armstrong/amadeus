Mayuri: Eh? Midnight oil? Are we eating?
UNSPOKEN: Sigh, kids these days.
Mayuri: Besides, Mayushii doesn't charge for her costumes.
UNSPOKEN: Seems like she understood the rest of what I said. It was just a joke, anyway.
Mayuri: Hobbies should just be hobbies, you know. It makes me happy to see someone wearing a costume I made♪
Rintaro: Do you want to become a designer?
UNSPOKEN: Come to think of it, Mayuri has never talked about her future.
Mayuri: No way. It's too hard!
Rintaro: Then what is your dream? Mine is to destroy the System and plunge the world into chaos.
Mayuri: Um... Mayushii just wants to keep hanging out in the lab.
Rintaro: What? You want to be a lab mem forever? I appreciate your enthusiasm, but this lab has no interest in profit. You'll always be hurting for food.
Mayuri: You know, Okarin, we have six lab mems now. Isnt it amazing? Mayushii never expected we'd grow this big.
UNSPOKEN: That's a sudden change in topic. And for some reason, she's puffing her chest out in pride.
Mayuri: It's all because Mayushii became your hostage!
Rintaro: No. That has nothing to do with it. I tricked every last one of you into joining with my masterful manipulations! Muhahaha!
Mayuri: You shouldn't say things like that. And besides, you didn't trick me!
Rintaro: That's true. You came of your own volition.
UNSPOKEN: She joined the lab without my ever asking. When she appeared in the doorway and offered to join, I thought she was a goddess sent from heaven. 
Mayuri: Okarin? Can Mayushii still be your hostage?
UNSPOKEN: Is that a joke or a serious question? I can't tell.
Rintaro: Is that what you want?
Mayuri: Well...
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri drops the costume in her hand. And then she smiles shyly.
Mayuri: Maybe it is!
Rintaro: Such a masochist! I had no idea!
Mayuri: ??? But I mean, as long as I'm your hostage, Mayushii won't be lonely, and neither will Okarin. Ehehe!
Rintaro: I... I see.
UNSPOKEN: Sometimes Mayuri throws me off my game. But if that's her reason for staying at the lab, then I'm happy.
Mayuri: Ah! I'd better get going.
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri stands up and starts putting away her various sewing tools.
Rintaro: Mayuri.
Mayuri: Hm?
Rintaro: Want to get something to eat on the way back? My treat.
Mayuri: Really? You never treat me.
Rintaro: Heh heh heh, I'm in a good mood today!
Mayuri: Then how about Kitchen Jiro? Their minced cutlet is, um, god tier.
UNSPOKEN: She'll get no argument from me.
Rintaro: Just leave it to me.
Mayuri: Yay! I love you, Okarin♪ Mayushii's really happy!
