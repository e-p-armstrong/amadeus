Faris: "I wanna hear the rest, nya♪ Kyouma and Daru-nyan were having a fun little chit-cat, nya? Something about a time machine. Faris really wants to hear, nyan!"
UNSPOKEN: She gives me a babyish look with upturned eyes. But I firmly reject her.
Rintaro: "It’s top secret. Not for outsiders!"
Faris: "And whose big mouth let the whole store hear, nya? Tell Faris, Daru-nyan..."
UNSPOKEN: She’s targeting Daru now. Don’t underestimate him, Faris NyanNyan. Daru is my most trustworthy right hand man, the wizard-class super hacka. He won’t be tricked into divulging classified information!
Itaru: "We’ve built an amazing machine that can send emails to the past. I did most of the work, of course."
UNSPOKEN: And he’s broken! Women are scary...
Faris: "Is that a time machine, nya!?"
Itaru: "I guess you could say that!"
Faris: "Wow! You’re awesome, nya! Your big brain makes my heart race, nyan."
Itaru: "You mean it? N-now I’m embarrassed, hehehe."
UNSPOKEN: Dumbass. What’s with that grin?
Faris: "Faris dreams of going on a journey through time nya."
Itaru: "I’ll bring you along some day."
Rintaro: "Daru, don’t make promises you can’t keep."
Faris: "By the way, it’s been bugging me, but what is time anyway, nya?"
Rintaro: "What?"
Faris: "Time is often compared to a river, nya, flowing from past to future. But is that really how it is, nya? If time is a river, then where is the present, nya? Is it a point? Is it a line? Where does the present begin and end, nya?"
Itaru: "Now that you mention it, I only have a vague concept of time. Never gave it any serious thought."
Rintaro: "The present is a leaf floating on the river. It moves along with the flow from past to future."
Faris: "So are we riding on that leaf, nya? When you die, do you fall off, nyan?"
Rintaro: "You could say that. All points upstream from the leaf are the past. Downstream, the future."
Faris: "Hmnya... But is that leaf only the present for humans, nya?"
Rintaro: "Meaning...?"
Faris: "Humans make units to define and observe time, which is how we know this leaf is the present. But if every living thing in the universe went extinct, nothing would exist to observe the present, nya. In that case, where would the present go, nya?"
Itaru: "Wouldn’t something like God or the will of the universe observe it?"
Faris: "But what if God is a four-dimensional being who can freely move through time, nya?"
Rintaro: "U-uh...?"
Faris: "If God is the one who decides the present, then won’t our present move with him, nya?"
Itaru: "This is hard..."
Rintaro: "So what you’re saying is that the present is subjective to the observer."
Faris: "If we go with that assumption, then the past and the future also depend on the observer, nyan. If Faris were to use a time machine to travel back one week, then Kyouma and Daru-nyan’s present would become Faris’s future, nya."
