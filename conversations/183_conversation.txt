Rintaro: "The round table doesn’t matter now. More importantly, the purpose of today’s meeting... Is to explore methods of true physical time travel, not just D-Mail, with the objective of sending someone to the past like SERN has."
Kurisu: "Don’t be ridiculous."
UNSPOKEN: That was fast. And she’s glaring at me even harder than she was during the whole underwear thing.
Kurisu: "SERN has the best equipment in the world, and even after nine years, they still haven’t succeeded. We can’t possibly hope to accomplish something like that."
Mayuri: "You’ll become a GelOkarin! Ehehe!"
Itaru: "Kinda sounds like Gero Froggy. Why did those things get popular, anyway?"
Kurisu: "This isn’t a laughing matter..."
Rintaro: "Isn’t it too early to give up? Haven’t we already succeeded with D-Mail, a first in human history?"
Itaru: "But we’re not the first. Didn’t SERN do it before us?"
Rintaro: "Humanity’s first time-traveling email. For we who have achieved that miracle, nothing is impossible!"
Kurisu: "Such baseless confidence. Anyway, wasn’t it just a coincidence that we discovered D-Mail? We still haven’t figured out what’s functioning as the lifter."
Rintaro: "We just need to figure that out, don’t we?"
Kurisu: "It’s futile. How do you solve a problem that even SERN can’t figure out? If you can’t set the destination, then you don’t know where you’ll leap to."
Itaru: "I’ll pass on leaping into deep space, thanks."
UNSPOKEN: That is a problem. If you can’t control where you’ll end up, your time machine is worthless.
Rintaro: "Wait a second. We don’t set the destination when we send a D-Mail, yet it still arrives where it’s supposed to. How do you explain that?"
Kurisu: "Now that you mention it..."
Itaru: "You set the mail address, right? Isn’t that enough?"
Kurisu: "Is it? I don’t think a phone signal can be received from millions of kilometers away."
Mayuri: "I bet you’d get a busy signal or something!"
UNSPOKEN: I stare at my phone.
Rintaro: "Maybe our cellphones are acting like black holes and white holes."
Kurisu: "You shouldn’t speculate like that. You have zero basis."
Rintaro: "Is it possible that we form a wormhole?"
Kurisu: "No wormholes have ever been confirmed to exist."
UNSPOKEN: I groan. Kurisu and Daru fall silent. The problem has them stumped too. Mayuri’s the only one smiling. She probably doesn’t understand and is just smiling because she feels like it.
Rintaro: "In any case, the cold, hard truth is that D-Mails arrive precisely when and where we want them to. We’re ahead of SERN in that regard. Now, can we apply D-Mail technology to physical time travel?"
Itaru: "But with D-Mails, you can only send 36 bytes of data. No way you can send a whole person with that kind of limit."
UNSPOKEN: It’s the same problem that SERN is having, and the reason their subjects turn into jellymen.
Kurisu: "If you want to become GelOkarin, I’m not stopping you."
