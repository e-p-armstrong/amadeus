UNSPOKEN: As usual, she pours in milk and syrup right in front of me. Kurisu watches this with great interest. I guess this is her first time at a maid cafe.
Faris: Is Mayushii the lucky girl, nya?
UNSPOKEN: Faris winks at me playfully while stirring Kurisu's iced coffee.
Rintaro: Why would you think that?
Faris: Hmmya? Not her, nya? Then...
UNSPOKEN: Faris looks at Kurisu.
Faris: Is it her, nya?
Kurisu: Hwehh...!
Rintaro: No, she's my assistant.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu and I exchange glares sharper than a sword's blade. I swear sparks are flying.
Faris: Then some other girl, nya? Kyouma, you tomcat, you're making moves on too many girls, nya.
Kurisu: Oh-ho... So you're making moves on too many girls, huh?
