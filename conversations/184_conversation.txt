Rintaro: Mayuri, I need to contact Faris.
Mayuri: Hweh?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri's eating an eclair. She must have stuck some in the fridge when I wasn't looking.
Mayuri: Want one, Okarin? They're delicious♪
UNSPOKEN: Now that she mentions it, Kurisu and Daru are eating too.
Rintaro: You people don't have a care in the world, do you!? There's some crazy stuff happening here!
Kurisu: Or it could all just be in your head. No need to panic.
UNSPOKEN: It's not just in my head. It's not!
Mayuri: You need Feris-chan for something? I wonder if she's working today.
Itaru: Faris-tan's off today.
UNSPOKEN: Well done, Daru. You know Faris's schedule better than her coworker. I award you the title of Faris Stalker.
Rintaro: You know her phone number, right? See if you can get ahold of her.
Mayuri: Okay!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri takes out her phone and makes a call. After a short wait, Mayuri smiles.
Mayuri: Feris-chan? Good afternyan-nyan♪ It's Mayushii, nyan♪
Kurisu: Nya, nyan...?
UNSPOKEN: Oh, right. This is the first time Kurisu has heard Mayuri speak NyanNyanian.
Mayuri: Sorry to bother you on your day off. Okarin said he wants to talk to you about something. Wanna talk to him? Huh? You know. Okarin! ...Kyouma? Who's Kyouma?
UNSPOKEN: The hell are they talking about? By the way, Faris is the only person who calls me by my true name, Hououin Kyouma. I'm thankful for that, but she still drives me crazy.
Mayuri: I'm handing you over, okay? Here you go, Okarin.
UNSPOKEN: I take Mayuri's phone. Faris' face is displayed on the LCD. She's wearing cat ears even though it's her day off.
Rintaro: It's me. Hououin Kyouma.
Faris: Nyao♪ How unusual for Kyouma to contact me, nya.
Rintaro: There's something I need to ask you. Long ago, you donated a retro PC to Yanabayashi shrine. Am I mistaken?
Faris: Nyan.
Rintaro: What? What's 'nyan' supposed to mean, nya?
UNSPOKEN: Ah crap, I started to talk like her. Kurisu bursts out laughing. Looks like she heard.
Faris: It means you're right, nya. Though I didn't know it was called the IBN 5100 until recently, nya.
Rintaro: What? Why recently?
Faris: Daru-nyan told me, nya.
