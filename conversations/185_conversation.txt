Rintaro: Ah, nothing...
UNSPOKEN: Faris was a retro PC maniac, wasn't she? Let's just make sure.
Rintaro: Do you have any other information on the IBN 5100? It's a super rare PC. As a charisma-build maid, I expect you have a strong network in Akiba, correct? I'd like you to use that network and search for any IBN 5100s in Akiba now.
UNSPOKEN: We only need to find one. It doesn't matter if it's the one I found at the shrine.
Faris: Hmnya... I can look. But for a price, nya.
Rintaro: A price?
UNSPOKEN: Is she trying to strike a deal? That's unexpected.
Rintaro: ...Let's hear it.
Faris: I want you to come over to Faris's apartment, nya.
Rintaro: Where is this apartment of yours?
UNSPOKEN: I quickly prepare a memo pad and write down the address Faris recites.
Rintaro: Oh, so you live in Akiba.
UNSPOKEN: That'll make things quick. Judging by the address, it should be right next to the station.
Faris: I'll be waiting, nyan♪
UNSPOKEN: I return Mayuri's phone and stand up from the couch. Let's stop by Yanabayashi Shrine and then head to Faris's place.
Rintaro: ...Well?
UNSPOKEN: I look over my shoulder with a frown.
Rintaro: Why are you guys tagging along?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri and Daru are following me, even though I didn't ask them to come. Kurisu stayed back at the lab.
Mayuri: Mayushii's never been to Feris-chan's place. I thought I'd like to visit once. Hehe♪
Itaru: I mean, it's Faris-tan's home. No way I'm missing this.
