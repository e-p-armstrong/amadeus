UNSPOKEN: If only you weren’t so weak to seduction.
Rintaro: "Christina. Report on the status of these translations."
Kurisu: "Can you stop talking like that? It’s pretentious and annoying as hell."
Mayuri: "Hell☆"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri takes a cute, idol-like pose and smiles for some reason.
Mayuri: "Um, Chris-chan, as Okarin’s childhood friend, I promise you’ll get used to how he talks eventually."
Kurisu: "I just hope it doesn’t take ten years..."
Rintaro: "So you’re saying you want to stay with me for ten years? In other words, you want to work at this lab for the rest of your--"
Kurisu: "It was sarcasm, get it? Sarcasm."
Rintaro: "...Oh. Give me your report, Christina. If you don’t, I’ll call you an ’@channeler’--"
Kurisu: "Didn’t you hear me the first time!?"
UNSPOKEN: She glares at me again. My blood goes cold.
Kurisu: "I’ve been working on the translation when I have time, but so far I haven’t seen anything new about time travel. It looks like SERN is still struggling to find a solution."
UNSPOKEN: Maybe they’ll have to wait another 24 years like Titor said.
Rintaro: "Daru, any other results?"
Itaru: "Well, it looks like SERN’s in the middle of a big project, so the LHC’s at full operation. I’m trying to see if I can cut in and maybe use it secretly."
Kurisu: "What? No way."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu’s stunned. Honestly, so am I.
Mayuri: "Is that amazing?"
Kurisu: "It’s not amazing. It’s downright outrageous! Super Hacka, what a monster!"
Rintaro: "Hey, Christina. Are you doing that on purpose?"
Kurisu: "Ugh... d-doing what?"
UNSPOKEN: She’s an @channeler. No doubt about it.
Itaru: "Anyway, I’m just doing it for laughs. It’s not like we have any reason to use the LHC."
Rintaro: "It sounds like things are going smoothly. When do you begin stage three of the operation?"
Itaru: "What’s stage three?"
Rintaro: "SERN’s most secret, forbidden domain. We’re going to free the darkness hidden inside."
Itaru: "In Japanese please."
Rintaro: "The IBN 5100 database. I’m asking if you’ve started hacking it yet."
UNSPOKEN: Daru frowns.
Itaru: "We can’t, remember?"
Rintaro: "You said all we needed was an IBN 5100 of our own!"
Itaru: "Right. That’s the problem. We can’t do anything without one."
Rintaro: "Huh?"
UNSPOKEN: Again, this feeling of disconnect. The conversation isn’t making sense.
Rintaro: "But I got you an IBN 5100. You haven’t started working on it yet?"
Itaru: "Huh? You got one? When?"
UNSPOKEN: Puzzled, I look at Kurisu and Mayuri. Mayuri looks confused, like always. Kurisu meets my eyes and shrugs her shoulders.
Kurisu: "First I’ve heard of it."
Rintaro: "Impossible!"
