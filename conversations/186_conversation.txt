UNSPOKEN: The normally expressionless Moeka frowns in bewilderment.
Rintaro: You... don't remember, do you?
UNSPOKEN: Moeka shakes her head faintly. Then she looks down and begins operating her phone at high speed. She really doesn't know? If the IBN 5100 had been stolen from the lab, then Moeka would be my first suspect. But the IBN 5100 disappeared from Yanabayashi Shrine, not the lab. It can't have been Moeka's doing. So it was the D-Mail? Or perhaps it was the work of SERN?
Rintaro: I'm sorry, Finger.
UNSPOKEN: I squat in front of Moeka and bow my head.
Rintaro: I suspected you. A lab mem! A comrade! I'm the worst sort of man. Hit me, please. I don't mind. But there's one thing I want you to know. In my long years running from the Organization, I've grown unable to trust anyone.
UNSPOKEN: Why? Why did I have to be born with these gifts that others so covet!?
Rintaro: Once I start to suspect, everyone looks suspicious. No matter how many comrades gather around me, I always feel alone. Pitiful, aren't I? D-did you just ignore my entire speech?
Itaru: Hey, Okarin. You're doing improv in the middle of the street. Has the heat gone to your head?
UNSPOKEN: So Moeka doesn't know I had an IBN 5100. And judging by her responses, she hasn't found one either. I feel like I'm getting farther and farther away from my goal.
Mayuri: I've been thinking... Moeka-san sure is pretty, isn't she? She's got a nice figure, and she's tall, too! She'd look great in one of my costumes. Ehehe!
Rintaro: Wh...at?
UNSPOKEN: For a second, I doubt my ears. I approach Mayuri.
Rintaro: You've met Moeka before?
Mayuri: Sure I have!
Rintaro: When!?
UNSPOKEN: I grab Mayuri by the shoulders and shake her. Her head bounces back and forth.
Mayuri: Ummmmm? When youuuuu brouuuught herrrr toooo theeee laaaaab!
Rintaro: I did...? Daru. Do you remember her?
Itaru: Sure. We met at the lab.
UNSPOKEN: After Moeka sent her D-Mail, Mayuri, Daru, and Kurisu behaved as if they had never met her before. But now both Mayuri and Daru know her? Does that mean Moeka's past was reconstructed again? Given the timing, it has to be Lukako's D-Mail that did it. But all he did was tell his mother to eat a lot of vegetables. How can that be related to the lab mems' knowledge of Moeka? Is this another example of the Butterfly Effect? The cause doesn't match the effect at all.
Mayuri: Okarin? We need to get going. Faris-chan's waiting, remember?
