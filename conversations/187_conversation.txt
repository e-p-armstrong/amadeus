Kurisu: "There was one more. The first mail Okabe accidentally sent that said I was dead."
Rintaro: "But from my perspective, we sent several more."
Mayuri: "You mean how you sent the winning LOTO SIX numbers? And how Luka-chan bought a ticket with those numbers, but didn’t win?"
Kurisu: "But nobody aside from Okabe remembers him sending it."
Rintaro: "But I showed you guys afterwards. It was still in my phone’s arrival history."
Itaru: "We were so close."
Mayuri: "Is that all?"
Rintaro: "No. There’s more. Moeka and Lukako each sent a D-Mail."
Kurisu: "Oh, right. That’s what you claim, but Hashida, Mayuri-san, and I don’t remember either of those."
Mayuri: "Owww... Mayushii’s getting a headache..."
Rintaro: "I already told you guys. I’m the only one who keeps his memories after the world changes."
Kurisu: "So according to your perspective, when did the IBN 5100 disappear? Did it just happen? When’s the last time you remember seeing it in the lab?"
Rintaro: "Well..."
UNSPOKEN: I put my index finger to my forehead and search my memories. IBN 5100... IBN 5100...
Rintaro: "I’m sure... it was August 3rd. I remember it being in the lab on August 3rd."
Kurisu: "Are you certain?"
Rintaro: "I... think so."
UNSPOKEN: So many things have happened. My memories are a jumble. Let’s go over the events which led to me obtaining the IBN 5100. I heard that Faris was a retro PC maniac who knew about the IBN 5100. I learned that nine years ago, she donated her IBN 5100 to Yanabayashi Shrine. I asked Lukako’s dad for help, and he leant me the IBN 5100 just like that. Mission complete. At the very least, Faris and Lukako should remember what happened. I should give them a call. First up is Lukako.
Luka: "Hello, Okabe-san. Um... p-please forget what you saw the other day..."
Rintaro: "I saw something?"
Luka: "My... cosplay..."
UNSPOKEN: Oh, that? That was just Lukako getting embarrassed for no reason.
Rintaro: "More importantly, I have questions about the IBN 5100."
Luka: "The... eyebeam... five?"
Rintaro: "IBN 5100. About nine years ago, someone dedicated a retro PC to Yanabayashi Shrine. That’s the one. Know anything?"
Luka: "Y-yes."
UNSPOKEN: He remembers! Lukako really remembers!
Rintaro: "Just a while ago, I came to the shrine looking for it, didn’t I!? And then I asked your old man and he let me borrow it. Right!?"
Luka: "Eh...? I don’t..."
Rintaro: "...Right?"
Luka: "I don’t remember anything like that..."
UNSPOKEN: What? Is this another effect of changing the past?
Rintaro: "The IBN 5100 was at the shrine though, right? Is it there now?"
Luka: "Um... I don’t know the details..."
Rintaro: "Where are you now? Is your old man there?"
