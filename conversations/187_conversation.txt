Itaru: Whoa, Okarin! Hold on there! Faris-tan's name is Faris NyanNyan. She doesn't have any other names!
Rintaro: Face reality, Daru. Faris NyanNyan is just her professional name.
Itaru: Uwahh, you're the worst! Why do you have to crush my dreams like that, man?
UNSPOKEN: Quit grumbling. You just can't handle the truth!
Rintaro: Well, Mayuri? Don't you know?
Mayuri: Hmmm, is it okay for Mayushii to tell you?
Rintaro: It's not like you took a vow of secrecy, right? And besides, we're visiting her home, so we'll find out soon enough.
Mayuri: Oh. I guess you're right... But just promise me you'll keep it secret, okay? Like from the masters who come to MayQueen.
UNSPOKEN: I nod.
Mayuri: Okay. Feris-chan's real name is Akiha Rumiho-chan!
Itaru: Nyah nyah nyah, not listening!
UNSPOKEN: Daru covers his ears and drowns the sound out.
Rintaro: Akiha...
UNSPOKEN: The same characters as in Akihabara. Appropriate. Our destination turns out to be the high-rise apartment building next to UPX.
Mayuri: Waahh... awwwesome...
Itaru: Wait... seriously?
Rintaro: She lives... here?
UNSPOKEN: We stand there for a while, staring wide-eyed at the towering building before us. According to the address Faris gave me, she lives on the top floor... all the way up there.
Rintaro: Did we get the wrong address?
UNSPOKEN: No. I wouldn't make such a stupid mistake.
Rintaro: Don't tell me Faris is working for the Organization!?
UNSPOKEN: I quickly scan the area. No suspicious figures in sight.
Rintaro: Does she have men in black waiting to haul us off to a re-education camp!?
Itaru: Nice delusion, man. The truth is stranger than fiction. Besides, don't you think it would be super moe if Faris-tan turned out to be a 'rich girl' character?
Rintaro: Nice delusion yourself, man.
Mayuri: Anyway, let's go in!
UNSPOKEN: When we call the top floor room via intercom, we're greeted by the voice of an elderly man. He lets us in immediately once I introduce myself as Hououin Kyouma. It feels like we're walking into a trap, but I can't turn back now. When we get off the elevator, the elderly man from the intercom is there to lead us inside. He turns out to be a silver-haired gentleman in a tuxedo.
Mayuri: A real live butler...
UNSPOKEN: He does indeed look like a stereotypical butler. He fits the bill so well, you wouldn't think he was anything else.
Butler: Mistress. Mr. Hououin Kyouma and friends have arrived.
UNSPOKEN: The butler leads us into a room. Faris is standing before a large window with a panoramic view of Akiba.
Faris: Thanks, Kuroki nya.
