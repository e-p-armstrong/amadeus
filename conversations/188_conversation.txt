UNSPOKEN: Faris's eyes twinkle when she sees Mayuri and Daru behind me.
Mayuri: Feris-chan, good afternyan-nyan♪
Itaru: Mhmm, casual Faris-tan... too cute!
UNSPOKEN: I silence the mouth-breathing Daru by introducing his ribs to my elbow.
Rintaro: They followed me. If you don't want them here, I'll send them home.
Faris: No fur off my back, nya. Everyone's welcome nyan♪
Rintaro: Wait, you talk like that even in your own home?
Faris: What do you mean, nya?
Rintaro: Gonna play dumb, Akiha Rumiho?
Faris: Faris is Faris, nya.
UNSPOKEN: Whatever.
Rintaro: Fine. What I really want to know is how you get to live in a luxury apartment in Akiba's best district!
UNSPOKEN: I look around the room again. The interior design and furnishings give a very refined impression. It's elegant without being ostentatious. Actually, it's kind of like a model home. There's nothing to suggest that this room is lived in. No dirty clothes, no used dishware -- not even a speck of dust. That butler, or maybe even some real maids -- if there's a butler, there have to be maids, right? -- must be constantly cleaning up. Speaking of the butler, he's disappeared. I didn't even notice him leave. He's clearly a master butler if he can move so quietly.
Rintaro: Faris... just who are you?
Faris: Like I said, Faris is Faris, nyan.
UNSPOKEN: Faris says it so nonchalantly.
Rintaro: Don't play dumb. If you don't explain yourself, I'm leaving!
Itaru: H-how arrogant... we're the ones who came here to ask Faris-tan for a favor, aren't we?
Faris: Hmmya... Well, if you must know... This land originally belonged to my family, nya.
Rintaro: Hah?
UNSPOKEN: What did she just say? This land originally belonged to her family?
Mayuri: Oh! So that's why you're Akiha-san!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri's exclamation connects the dots in my head.
Rintaro: Akiha... You mean you're descended from the hereditary landholders of Akihabara!?
UNSPOKEN: Faris nods with a proud expression. So she really is a 'rich girl' character.
Faris: By the way, Faris has considerable influence on Akihabara's development, nyan.
UNSPOKEN: Faris wriggles her slender waist and makes a gesture like a cat washing its face.
Faris: It was Faris who convinced the development board to actively promote moe culture in Akiba, nya.
Mayuri: Wow! That's amazing!
Faris: I've been going to development meetings since I was little, nya.
UNSPOKEN: So basically, the chaotic changes in Akiba are all a result of this catgirl's whims?
Faris: But please keep all this a secret, nyan.
UNSPOKEN: Faris's expression suddenly darkens.
Rintaro: Why?
Faris: You wanna know, nya?
UNSPOKEN: Faris approaches me with a bewitching expression.
Faris: That's because...
