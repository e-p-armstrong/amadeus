Rintaro: There's nothing we can do to prevent her death. Just stay close and tell me when it happens. Once I know, I'll make the time leap.
Kurisu: I can't believe there's nothing we can do. It just doesn't feel real. But it's the truth, isn't it? I can see it in your eyes. ...Are you okay?
Rintaro: No. I still haven't saved Mayu--
Kurisu: I know. That's not what I meant.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu interrupts me.
Kurisu: Are you okay?
Rintaro: I don't follow.
Kurisu: You're carrying an awful burden.
UNSPOKEN: It's rare for her to look so concerned for me.
Rintaro: I told you not to worry about me. It's Mayuri you need to worry about. Tomorrow, I'm going to look for Moeka.
UNSPOKEN: If Mayuri doesn't die tomorrow, I can postpone the time leap. If Mayuri does die tomorrow, I'll return to the past no matter what.
Rintaro: I wish there were some way that Mayuri wouldn't have to suffer...
Kurisu: Then why don't you time leap now?
Rintaro: I can't plan effectively without knowing the deadline.
Kurisu: I don't want to see Mayuri die either, you know.
Rintaro: I know how you feel, but you're the only one I can ask.
Kurisu: Where did all this trust come from?
Rintaro: ...You're my assistant, after all.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu forces a laugh at my feeble attempt at a joke.
Kurisu: You're so full of yourself.
