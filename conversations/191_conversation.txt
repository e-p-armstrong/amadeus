UNSPOKEN: In other words, I can kill her instead of letting her commit suicide?
Rintaro: She's already going to die, so that makes it okay. That the kind of argument a murderer would make.
Kurisu: Don't be a hypocrite. We're not talking about right and wrong here, Okabe.
UNSPOKEN: She's unforgiving as always, but it actually feels nice to speak frankly like this.
Rintaro: But what about the law? Even if fate forgives me, society won't.
Kurisu: As long as you have the Time Leap Machine, you can undo anything, even murder. The result will be that you gained the necessary information without killing anybody.
Rintaro: I understand.
Kurisu: ...Phew. Just remember one thing. You're responsible for what you do. ...I guess that's quite a thing for me to say, huh? After telling you to kill her.
Rintaro: It's fine. Your advice was truly becoming of a mad scientist.
Kurisu: Get it done, Okabe. Bye.
