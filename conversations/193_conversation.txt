Faris: "That’s because..."
UNSPOKEN: Faris gently strokes my cheek with her cool, slender fingers. I feel myself falling under her spell. And then-- She grins.
Faris: "Faris is Faris, nya♪"
UNSPOKEN: Damn you, catgirl! How dare you make a fool of me!?
Faris: "I want all my fans to keep treating me the same as always, nyan☆"
UNSPOKEN: Daru starts fist pumping when he sees Faris’s cutesy act.
Itaru: "I’ll treat you! I’ll treat you at full force!"
Mayuri: "Mayushii’s your fan too! Your maid spirit is really amazing!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri and Daru might have fallen for her charms, but not I.
Rintaro: "I don’t care about any of this!"
UNSPOKEN: I thrust my finger at Faris.
Rintaro: "Do not defy me, Faris NyanNyan, or I’ll paint your expensive wallpaper with blood. You called me to your home so you could show off your status and try to gain leverage in our negotiations. But it’s futile. For you are dealing with the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!"
Itaru: "What kind of reason is that..."
UNSPOKEN: Heh. Perfect! Now Faris will tremble in fear and beg for my forgiveness. Or so I thought, but instead, she looks at me with gleaming eyes.
Faris: "Nyan♪ Faris loves forceful men, nyan."
Itaru: "What... did she say?"
UNSPOKEN: That’s my line. I wanted to threaten her, not seduce her. Is Faris a masochist!?
Faris: "Honestly, Faris didn’t want to talk so much about herself, nya. Most people, when they learn who I am, stop seeing me as Faris, nya. They only see the Akiha name. Faris and Akiha Rumiho want to be seen as separate purrsons, nya."
Rintaro: "There’s nothing to separate. You are Faris NyanNyan, are you not?"
Faris: "Nya?"
Itaru: "For once I agree with you, Okarin! Whenever she speaks NyanNyanian and wears her cat ears, she is Faris-tan!"
Rintaro: "You’re just being overly self-conscious, Faris."
Faris: "I don’t know, nya..."
Rintaro: "I’m serious. To me, you will always be the unbeatable cat-eared maid!"
Faris: "Nyahaha. Thanks, Kyouma."
UNSPOKEN: Why is she thanking me? Well, she’s probably admiring my incredible magnanimity. Muhahaha! Now then, let’s finish this idle gossip and get down to business.
Rintaro: "Faris, you said there would be a price to pay in exchange for your help acquiring an IBN 5100. What is your price? Do not test the limits of my good will. If I unseal my right arm for even an instant, everything will be destroyed, and nothing will remain... just so you know."
Faris: "Fine by me, nya."
UNSPOKEN: Faris points at the cat ears sticking out of her head.
Faris: "These cat ears have the power to negate all other powers -- NyanNyan Clear. When Kyouma’s power is unleashed, Faris will stop it, nya."
