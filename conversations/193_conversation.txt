UNSPOKEN: Wh-what? Even Mayuri's on Faris's side? She was like this with Moeka too.
Rintaro: Mmmgh...
UNSPOKEN: This is bad. I thought I had Faris in the palm of my hand. Was I dancing to her tune all along!?
Kurisu: Okabe? If you're not gonna send anything, I'm hanging up.
Rintaro: W-wait! Fine. Activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
UNSPOKEN: Dammit, I submitted to the catgirl!
Kurisu: The discharge is starting.
UNSPOKEN: I nod to Faris after getting Kurisu's report. Faris puts her finger on the send button and--
Faris: Click, nya!
UNSPOKEN: As the dizziness fades, I exhale slowly and open my eyes. Alright, world. Show me your new form! Man, I wish I knew what kind of mail Faris sent. First things first. I'm still in her room. When I look out the window, the Akiba sprawl greets me. I scan the room.
Itaru: Okay. Card Open.
Mayuri: Oh no! Another Virus Card!
Faris: Not so fast, nyan♪
Mayuri: Awww... You took three Link Cards, right? And I got three Virus Cards, right? Mayushii's in trouble...
UNSPOKEN: What are they doing? The three of them are sitting around a table, playing some kind of game.
Itaru: We still have a Terminal Card. We can turn the tables next turn.
Faris: Nyahaha♪ It's way too late for that, nya. Faris is going to use the Terminal Card, Virus Checker, nya. So, which is Mayushii's last Virus Card, nya?
Mayuri: Oh no...
Itaru: You're a monster, Faris-tan.
Mayuri: H-hey, could you wait one... no, two or three turns, nya? Please, nya?
Faris: Nyaha♪ Not even if you try to copycat Faris, nyan.
Mayuri: No way!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri puts her fingers to both her eyes as if to mime tears. Anyway, it looks like they're playing RaiNet AccessBattlers. It happened again. Reading Steiner. I am the only person in the world who keeps his memories after the past changes.  Faris's D-Mail worked. That's why the three of them are now playing a card game instead of waiting for Faris to press the button. Faris never even sent the D-Mail. If I look at her phone, there won't be any record of it in her send history. And even if I demand that she tell me what she sent, she won't be able to answer. Because the very fact that she sent it has been erased. The only trace of the D-Mail is in the recipient's phone -- namely, Faris's father's phone ten years ago. But that ten-year-old mail data was most likely erased long ago. So I don't think we can check. I have to figure out what changed the hard way. Let's start looking for differences.
Mayuri: Phew... Feris-chan is really strong.
Faris: Mayushii started out strong, nya. You have potential, nyan. But don't think I'll go easy on you just because we're playing for fun, nyan! Besides, I promised Papa that I'd win the next tournyament, nya! I can't lose to anyone before then, nyan!
