Faris: "Well, I guess I’ll tell you, nya. My price..."
UNSPOKEN: Faris chuckles. But I notice something. Her eyes aren’t smiling.
Faris: "Is to let me use your time machine, nya."
UNSPOKEN: Yes. I had a feeling that was it.
Faris: "I heard what you said at MayQueen yesterday. You’ve built a time machine."
Rintaro: "Indeed. We have created the first successful time machine in human history."
Itaru: "Uh, SERN was the first."
Rintaro: "But don’t misunderstand. We call it a time machine, but it’s not the kind you can hop into and fly to whenever you want. All we can do is send a 36-byte email to someone’s phone in the past. But even that is worthy of a Nobel Prize in physics. It is a transcendental super invention that will alter the course of human history forever."
Faris: "It can send an email to someone in the past? That’s awesome! Faris wants to use it, nya!"
UNSPOKEN: Faris jumps up and down with joy.
Rintaro: "The time machine is our lab’s greatest secret. If you want to use it, then you must become a lab mem."
Faris: "A lab mem? What’s that, nya?"
Mayuri: "Well, it means you get to be a part of our club♪ Mayushii would be super happy if Feris-chan became a lab mem!"
Itaru: "Same here! That would be AWWWWWRIGHT! Please join! I’m begging here!"
Faris: "How do I become a lab mem, nya?"
Rintaro: "There’s no contract. We only require that you perform... the blood oath."
Faris: "The... blood oath!!"
UNSPOKEN: The window is closed, but a gust of wind blows through the room. It’s coming from the air conditioner. But outside the window, I see rainclouds cover the sky. I hear the rumbling of thunder inside my brain.
Rintaro: "Faris NyanNyan, if thou dost desire to join the hallowed order of lab mems, then by the code passed down in High Ancient from an age long forgotten... Pledge thy flesh, thy bone, thy blood, and thy soul to the Grail of Heaven, and swear fealty everlasting! This duty fulfilled, the old gods shall grant thee thy lab mem number."
Itaru: "I didn’t understand a word of that..."
Mayuri: "Oh no! What do I do? Mayushii never ate any blood loaf. Does that mean Mayushii’s not a lab mem?"
Itaru: "Don’t worry, Mayu-shi. This is just Okarin’s usual nonsense."
Mayuri: "Oh! I guess everything’s fine then♪ Thank goodness!"
Faris: "Very well, nya. I shall take the blood oath, nya..."
UNSPOKEN: With a grim expression, Faris grabs the small knife on top of her desk-- And suddenly slashes it against her wrist.
Rintaro: "--!?"
Mayuri: "No!"
Itaru: "Uh, isn’t that a paper knife?"
Faris: "Nyahaha♪ Daru-nyan’s right, nya!"
