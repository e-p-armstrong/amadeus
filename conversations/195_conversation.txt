Faris: "Purrfect. So now can I use the time machine, nya?"
Rintaro: "Indeed. But not a word to anyone. Death to traitors. That’s the law of the lab."
Mayuri: "It is?"
Itaru: "No. Okarin made it up just now."
Faris: "Thanks, Kyouma!"
UNSPOKEN: Faris hugs me by the neck. A very sweet aroma tickles my nose. And something very soft tickles my...
Itaru: "Okarin, you jerk! I helped make the PhoneWave too!"
Faris: "Really nya? Then Daru-nyan too!"
UNSPOKEN: Faris flies over to Daru.
Mayuri: "I’m glad she’s so happy, Okarin♪"
Rintaro: "Heh heh heh... Mayuri, you really are innocent."
Mayuri: "Hweh?"
UNSPOKEN: I take out my phone and put it to my ear.
Rintaro: "It’s me. ...Yeah, I’ve got her wrapped around my finger. What did you expect? She’s just a 17-year-old girl. That catgirl thinks she’s bargained with me to appease her lust for mankind’s dream, the forbidden fruit that is the time machine. But she’s dancing to the tune of Hououin Kyouma! ...Hmph, why did I agree to pay her price, you ask? That should be obvious."
UNSPOKEN: Then I twist my lips into a grin. My razor-sharp shark teeth are probably glistening right now. ...Damn, I wish I had shark teeth.
Rintaro: "That catgirl shall be our guinea pig. ...I’m a monster? What a terrible thing to say. Not that you’re wrong, exactly. Heh heh heh."
Mayuri: "...?"
UNSPOKEN: Our D-Mail experiments have reached a standstill. Kurisu refuses to become a subject, and Mayuri and Daru are too dumb to be useful. We managed to experiment on Moeka and Lukako, but we still need more data. Along comes Faris. She’s going to provide me with both an IBN 5100 and new data. Two birds with one stone!
Rintaro: "Right. Faris thinks she’s using us... But it is we who are using her! She is but a moth drawn to my brilliant flame. Muhahaha! As planned, we are proceeding to the next phase of the experiment. This is the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo."
UNSPOKEN: Someone taps me on the shoulder after I put away my phone. Right after that, they blow into my ear.
Rintaro: "Mmgh!?"
Faris: "Who were you talking to, nya?"
UNSPOKEN: Faris is behind me. She must have finished servicing Daru while I was still on the phone. No doubt she heard everything.
Rintaro: "It’s too late, Faris NyanNyan. You’ve already taken the blood oath. If you break it, ruin will befall you. There is no escape."
Faris: "Ok, nya. So where’s the time machine, nya?"
UNSPOKEN: She’s certainly in a hurry.
Rintaro: "The time machine -- its name is the PhoneWave (name subject to change), by the way -- is in our lab."
