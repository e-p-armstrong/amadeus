Mayuri: "Umm, so does that mean it has to keep going for 86, 000 seconds? Won’t PhoneWave-chan get tired?"
Rintaro: "It doesn’t actually have to run the entire duration."
UNSPOKEN: Our previous experiments have confirmed that.
Rintaro: "The mail reaches the past if you send it as soon as the discharge begins. In accordance with the Butterfly Effect, the remaining seconds should be canceled out. The experiment never happened."
UNSPOKEN: The fact that the D-Mail was sent is erased, leaving behind only the mail in the recipient’s phone. At least, that’s what our experiments have shown so far. Now, let’s call Kurisu.
Kurisu: "Hallo."
Rintaro: "It’s me. What’s the situation? She hung up on me!"
Itaru: "Of course she did. Mayu-shi and I are the only ones who can deal with your act, you know?"
UNSPOKEN: Again!
Kurisu: "Hallo."
Rintaro: "It’s Hououin Kyouma. Don’t hang up."
Kurisu: "Oh, it’s Okabe. I was sure it was a prank call."
Rintaro: "It shows you my number, doesn’t it!?"
Kurisu: "You were talking crazy, so I got scared and hung up."
Rintaro: "In other words, you fear the insanity of Hououin Kyouma! Well, I suppose you can’t be blamed for-- She hung up! Again!"
Itaru: "Like I said, we’re the only ones who can put up with you..."
UNSPOKEN: I quickly redial.
Kurisu: "Hallo."
Rintaro: "This is Okabe Rintaro. Sorry, but could you mess with the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s settings a little, please?"
Kurisu: "Well why didn’t you say so? Hmm... you’re going to use the PhoneWave? I don’t want to anger the guy downstairs, though."
Rintaro: "We’re about to perform a critical experiment. Understand, assistant? Mister Braun might yell at you, but that small sacrifice will bring mankind’s dream, the time machine, to fruition."
Kurisu: "You’re really irresponsible, you know that? ...Well? What should I set it to?"
UNSPOKEN: I tell her Faris’s dad’s mail address. And I have her set the timer.
Kurisu: "Okay, it’s ready."
Rintaro: "Alright, thanks. Wait a bit."
UNSPOKEN: I turn to Faris.
Rintaro: "Finished writing what you want to send?"
UNSPOKEN: I already told her the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s email address. Faris nods.
Rintaro: "What did you write? You sure it’s something that’ll change the past?"
Faris: "W-well..."
UNSPOKEN: Hm? What happened to her usual confidence?
Faris: "I-it’s embarrassing, nya! A trade secret, nyan!"
Rintaro: "A secret!? Nonsense! This is science! Unless we know what you’re sending, we can’t verify the results!"
Faris: "What’s that supposed to mean!? No one said anything about science, nya! I’m using the time machine for myself, not science, nya!"
Rintaro: "That’s not fair!"
Itaru: "You’re one to talk."
