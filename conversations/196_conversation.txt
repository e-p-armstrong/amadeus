Rintaro: That the IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine. I tried to cancel it by telling her it's a trap, but it didn't work. I'll try to phrase it differently.
Kurisu: Wait. We went through this with the LOTO SIX experiment, remember?
UNSPOKEN: The LOTO SIX experiment... I sent myself the winning numbers, but the past me didn't buy the ticket. Instead, he gave the winning numbers to Lukako.
Kurisu: The person who reads the D-Mail chooses whether or not to act accordingly. Kiryu learned that the IBN 5100 was at the shrine. Though the cancellation mail came right afterward, I guess she ignored it and went anyway.
Rintaro: Maybe she didn't believe the cancellation mail. Or maybe she was so diligent she decided to check it out even when told not to.
UNSPOKEN: I glance at Moeka. She's still hanging her head, but her tears have run dry. I wonder if she's listening.
Kurisu: Damn. Even when told it was too risky to go to the shrine, she went anyway...
Rintaro: We need a more persuasive message. Something that will prevent her from going to the shrine.
Kurisu: Like what?
UNSPOKEN: That's the problem. Is it possible to persuade her with just 36 bytes of text? Or should we consider other possibilities?
Rintaro: What if I send a D-Mail to myself on July 30th? Could I beat her to the IBN 5100?
Kurisu: Were you even interested in the IBN 5100 then?
UNSPOKEN: When did I start caring about the IBN 5100? I can't remember. Fine. That's out. So how do I convince Moeka to listen? At that moment, an electric shock runs through my brain. Two initials.
Rintaro: ...FB.
Kurisu: What?
Rintaro: Moeka's handler. She's obsessed with FB. If the mail comes from FB, she'll do whatever it says.
Kurisu: Do you have FB's phone?
Rintaro: No. They haven't even met. We don't know where FB is.
Kurisu: Then there's nothing we can do.
Rintaro: ...Give me a little time.
Kurisu: Gonna make me wait again? Well, I've been pulling all-nighters recently, so whatever. Just don't do anything stupid, okay?
