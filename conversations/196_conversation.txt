Mayuri: MayQueen? What's that? A potato?
Rintaro: MayQueen+NyanÂ²!
UNSPOKEN: I ask Daru too, but no reaction.
Mayuri: Mayushii works at Lemoine, remember?
Rintaro: Lemoine? Is that a maid cafe?
Mayuri: It's just a normal coffee shop.
Rintaro: Is there even a single maid cafe in Akiba?
Itaru: Naw man. The people here hate moe businesses. Nobody would go.
UNSPOKEN: It's clear now. This has to be the result of Faris's D-Mail. The Butterfly Effect is at it again. Faris said she had influence over Akiba's development board. They adopted her plan and embraced the moe industry. But by sending a D-Mail to 2000, the worldline has shifted to one where that never happened. Akiba is still electronics all the way. To think that a single mail could rewrite ten years of a town's history. Is it okay to change history on a whim like this? I almost feel guilty about it, but since I'm the only one who remembers the original Akiba, nobody can blame me. And it's not like I can change it back. But still... what in the world did Faris's D-Mail say? The next morning, I go for a stroll through the streets of Akiba. What I discover is that, although the chaotic energy familiar to me has receded, Akiba is still Akiba at its core. The few electronics stores that I used to frequent are still here. In fact, they've multiplied. You can still hear their loud theme songs and the cries of salesmen all the way from the sidewalk. Electronics otaku and PC maniacs walk the streets with unkempt hair, wrinkled clothes, and eyes burning with intense purpose. There are even cheerful foreigners taking in the sights. The maids and young female otaku have disappeared, but the hobbyist essence of the town is unchanged. I admit it's a relief. Yesterday, I heard from Mayuri how we met Faris on this worldline. I was wondering, since MayQueen no longer exists. It was at a small RaiNet tournament at a toy store in Ikebukuro. We went to cheer on Daru, but he dropped out because of a stomachache, so Mayuri and I ended up taking his place. Our opponent was Faris. We got crushed, needless to say, but Mayuri says that Faris was very gracious and gave us advice on how to play. That was the beginning of their beautiful friendship. Our past has changed considerably, yet we still ended up with the same close relationship we had on the last worldline. Fascinating.  Maybe Lady Luck is looking out for us. I've got mail.
Rintaro: What the hell?
UNSPOKEN: Is this a prank? Spam? Why red gelatin? Who's watching me? What's going on here? I spin around, searching the crowd. A few passers-by look at me strangely. I don't care. Something is wrong. Goosebumps break out over my body.
Rintaro: Is it the Organization? SERN?
