Rintaro: It's Sunday. Obon weekend. What are you doing here, lab girls?
Luka: Pardon the intrusion, Okabe-san.
Mayuri: Good morning, Okarin♪
UNSPOKEN: The two cute high school girls wave to me in greeting. By the way, one of these girls is actually a boy. In any case, the sight warms my heart -- or would, if not for a certain assistant who just gives me a bored look before going back to reading.
Rintaro: What are you doing?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri and Lukako are sitting next to each other on the sofa, reading a book together. It looks like a cosplay photo album.
Mayuri: Yesterday I went to Nakano to buy doujinshi, remember? While I was there, I found a photo album of a super cute cosplayer! So I splurged on it♪ Look, Luka-chan! This is a costume of Sedona from Blood Tune. It's so detailed and cute!
Luka: It is!
UNSPOKEN: I see. She's showing it to Lukako as part of his reeducation. To think that he was so reluctant to get involved in cosplay. Looks like Mayuri's persistence has paid off. Actually, judging by his obvious interest in the photo album, maybe he was always interested in cosplay -- just too shy to cosplay himself.
Mayuri: Take a look, Chris-chan! It's amazing!
Kurisu: I'm okay.
UNSPOKEN: Looks like Kurisu's not interested in the photo album. She just gives a cold hmph. Instead, she's reading a difficult-looking English book. Dammit, this is no time to be showing off your intelligence. You're going to make Mayuri cry if you talk to her like that. Or so I thought, but Mayuri doesn't seem to mind, so I stay out of it.
Mayuri: Wow, look at these swimsuits! So much skin! She's got a great figure, like a gravure idol.
Luka: Must be nice...
Mayuri: Nice? The swimsuits?
Luka: I... don't have that great a figure...
Mayuri: Don't worry, Luka-chan. I'm sure you'll make our big friends breathe hard.
UNSPOKEN: Hey now, Mayuri. What are you saying? It's like you're referring to Daru with that remark.
Mayuri: And um, plenty of people like flat chests. So even if you don't have breasts, you should still have confidence in yourself.
Kurisu: Khmmkhmmkhmm!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu starts choking on her coffee. I know how she feels. I almost did a spittake with my soda. Mayuri's breasts are huge for her height, so her advice lacks a certain element of persuasion.
Mayuri: I know! Once ComiMa's over, let's all go on a trip to the beach! Mayushii's been making costumes all summer. I haven't had time to play at all. What do you think, guys? A lab mem beach trip!
Luka: Um... all of the lab mems?
Kurisu: I can't go. I have to go back to America soon, and I haven't even started packing yet.
Rintaro: Yes, I can see you're in a rush. I bet you don't even have time to lounge around and read.
