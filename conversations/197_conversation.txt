UNSPOKEN: Moeka's a mailing machine. She sent FB nearly 10 mails a day, but FB replied to every single one. You'd have to be a saint to reply to all those emails. No wonder Moeka was so dependent on FB.
Rintaro: So... time for another stakeout.
UNSPOKEN: I have Daru set up a wireless infrared camera on the telephone pole down the street. We park a couple blocks away and watch the video feed. The next day, Tennouji goes to work on his moped like usual. He returns after sunset. There's no sign of his daughter, Nae, or his wife. Something finally happens early Sunday morning. Just before 3 AM, six people show up at Tennouji's house.
Rintaro: It's them!
UNSPOKEN: It's dark, but I recognize them. They're the Rounders who raided the lab with Moeka. Moeka doesn't show much of a reaction. I thought she knew them. I ask, but she says she's never met them before. It looks like this worldline's Moeka has been cut off completely. Were they done with her once she found them an IBN 5100? Tennouji comes outside and loads the IBN 5100 into the station wagon. Then the six men get in and drive away. Tennouji sees them off, then goes back inside his house. 
Moeka: What now?
UNSPOKEN: I'm interested in Tennouji's story, but the IBN 5100 will lead us to FB. We decide to follow the station wagon. The pursuit ends at Narita International Airport. The six men, IBN 5100 in tow, board a plane headed for France. France. SERN's home country. What does this mean?
Rintaro: Tennouji's wife might be FB.
UNSPOKEN: Since there's been no sign of FB this far, she must be an extremely cautious individual. But the evidence suggests only one possibility. On worldline Alpha 1, Moeka's men attacked the night the Time Leap Machine was completed. Their timing was perfect. It makes sense if you assume that Tennouji is closely linked to FB. He was right downstairs the whole time we were discussing our plans. FB knew exactly what we were up to. We were dancing to her tune all along. When we get back to Akiba, Moeka and I start walking towards Tennouji's house. But on the way, I get an angry call from Kurisu demanding an update, so I decide to take care of that first. Kurisu sighs when she sees me.
Kurisu: I thought I asked you to keep me posted.
Rintaro: I've been busy.
Kurisu: Busy. Right.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu glances at Moeka.
Rintaro: Were you worried about me?
Kurisu: O-of course not! Why should I care what you're up to? It's just... Mayuri was really worried. I don't want to see her sad. So at least give her a call, okay?
UNSPOKEN: Now that she mentions it, it feels like I haven't talked to Mayuri in forever.
Rintaro: I'm doing this to save Mayuri. I'm close to discovering our true enemy.
Kurisu: Our enemy? But...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu glances at Moeka again. Moeka is completely expressionless. She's lightly kicking the dirt in boredom. She hasn't used her phone once since we began the search for FB.
Kurisu: Isn't she our enemy?
Rintaro: She is an enemy, but we're cooperating in order to uncover the truth.
Kurisu: Isn't she the one who... killed Mayuri?
Rintaro: ...Yes.
UNSPOKEN: However, Moeka's just a pawn, and one that no longer poses a threat. To save Mayuri, I need to capture the king. Well, the king's cellphone.
Kurisu: Whatever. So where are you going now? Take me with you.
Rintaro: Have you gone mad, assistant mine?
Kurisu: I'm perfectly sane, and I'm not your assistant.
Rintaro: It could be dangerous.
Kurisu: Eh...
