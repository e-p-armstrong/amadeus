UNSPOKEN: An impatient Kurisu nags me through the phone. Don’t rush me, dammit!
Mayuri: "Um, Okarin, it’s probably something private, so I don’t think you should pry..."
UNSPOKEN: Wh-what? Even Mayuri’s on Faris’s side? She was like this with Moeka too.
Rintaro: "Mmmgh..."
UNSPOKEN: This is bad. I thought I had Faris in the palm of my hand. Was I dancing to her tune all along!?
Kurisu: "Okabe? If you’re not gonna send anything, I’m hanging up."
Rintaro: "W-wait! Fine. Activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change)."
UNSPOKEN: Dammit, I submitted to the catgirl!
Kurisu: "The discharge is starting."
UNSPOKEN: I nod to Faris after getting Kurisu’s report. Faris puts her finger on the send button and--
Faris: "Click, nya!"
UNSPOKEN: As the dizziness fades, I exhale slowly and open my eyes. Alright, world. Show me your new form! Man, I wish I knew what kind of mail Faris sent. First things first. I’m still in her room. When I look out the window, the Akiba sprawl greets me. I scan the room.
Itaru: "Okay. Card Open."
Mayuri: "Oh no! Another Virus Card!"
Faris: "Not so fast, nyan♪"
Mayuri: "Awww... You took three Link Cards, right? And I got three Virus Cards, right? Mayushii’s in trouble..."
UNSPOKEN: What are they doing? The three of them are sitting around a table, playing some kind of game.
Itaru: "We still have a Terminal Card. We can turn the tables next turn."
Faris: "Nyahaha♪ It’s way too late for that, nya. Faris is going to use the Terminal Card, Virus Checker, nya. So, which is Mayushii’s last Virus Card, nya?"
Mayuri: "Oh no..."
Itaru: "You’re a monster, Faris-tan."
Mayuri: "H-hey, could you wait one... no, two or three turns, nya? Please, nya?"
Faris: "Nyaha♪ Not even if you try to copycat Faris, nyan."
Mayuri: "No way!"
