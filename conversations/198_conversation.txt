Itaru: "Whoa, Faris-tan’s dad... Shouldn’t we say hello?"
Mayuri: "He’s a CEO, right? Wow..."
UNSPOKEN: Faris soon returns. Then she turns to us and puts her hands together in a gesture of apology.
Faris: "Sorry nya! Faris has to go out with Papa, nya."
Mayuri: "Okay. I guess we’ll see you later, then."
Itaru: "But Faris-tan, what about my match? You promised to give me a hands-on lesson -- you know, really work me over."
Faris: "Pretty sure I didn’t, nya."
Itaru: "Of course you didn’t... I was just making it up..."
Mayuri: "Daru-kun, you shouldn’t trouble Feris-chan like that. Come on, Okarin. Let’s go back to the lab."
Rintaro: "Yeah."
Faris: "You know, Kyouma’s been awfully quiet, nya. Something wrong, nyan?"
Rintaro: "Nothing. I was just looking at Akiba, watching the ignorant masses scurry about in search of momentary surcease from the pain of existence."
Itaru: "That’s Okarin for you... batshit crazy."
UNSPOKEN: Faris, her dad, and their butler see us off. Her dad tells us to come visit again. Faris’s dad seems like a cool guy. He’s not pompous like you expect rich people to be. The sun is setting, but there’s still a crowd in front of Akiba Station. More foreigners than usual. People come from all over the world to buy electronics and otaku goods in Akiba, but it looks like the satellite is attracting some as well. Man, it’s hot. Less than a minute outside and I’m already drenched in sweat. Faris’s air-conditioned apartment was a little slice of heaven. I’d love air conditioning in the lab, but we don’t have that kind of money. Anyway, how about some food? I turn around to ask Daru and Mayushii what they think. Mayuri’s not there.
Rintaro: "Huh? Where’d Mayuri go?"
Itaru: "Huh? You’re right. She’s gone."
UNSPOKEN: Did Stardust Handshake activate again? I scan the area. There she is, walking casually towards the station. She’s already about 50 meters away. I chase after her.
Rintaro: "Mayuri, where are you going!?"
Mayuri: "Okarin! Um, Mayushii was thinking about stopping by Nakano Broadway before going home."
Rintaro: "If you’re going home, then why didn’t you say so?"
Mayuri: "Ehehe. Sorry. All I could think about was going to Nakano."
Itaru: "Mayu-shi’s like some kinda ninja. Never noticed she was gone."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri does this a lot. She just wanders off without saying anything. And just like Daru said, you never notice she’s gone. So when you turn around to look for her, it’s like she vanished into thin air. Stardust Handshake and Sneaking Fade -- why did her powers have to be so annoying?
Rintaro: "What business do you have in Nakano, anyway?"
