Luka: ah...
Kurisu: You...
Mayuri: Awawa...
Rintaro: Ohhhh? Huh? What? Why?
UNSPOKEN: I feel around some more.
Luka: Ugh, no, don't... Okabe-san, please... stop... sniff.
UNSPOKEN: Nothing. Nada. It should be there. I mean, he's a guy... isn't he? An electric current runs through my brain. No way... Yes way. So that's what happened!
Rintaro: Lukako, you...
UNSPOKEN: The D-Mail that I thought had failed... Was actually a success!
Rintaro: You're a girl!?
Kurisu: That's what we've been saying!
UNSPOKEN: A half-second later, Kurisu cracks me over the head with her heavy textbook.
Luka: hic... ugg... egh...
UNSPOKEN: When my vision clears, Lukako is crying. Mayuri is rubbing her back comfortingly. Kurisu, meanwhile, is glaring down at me like I'm something she scraped off the bottom of her shoe. Daru, who arrived a moment ago, is in the corner, trying not to laugh. Honestly, I can't blame him.  Righteous High School Girl Makes Perverted College Guy Beg for Forgiveness If I had to put a title to this scene, that's what it would be. The top of my head is throbbing. Most likely because Kurisu wiped out a hundred million of my precious neurons, envied by scientists the world over. I put a moist towel to my head.
Kurisu: I want to vivisect your skull and remove your brain for a good washing. Then I'll submerge it in culture fluid so you can never do anything like that again! Anyway, just be thankful I haven't reported you to the police.
Rintaro: Yes ma'am. I'm sorry.
UNSPOKEN: Man, that was dumb. I didn't think it would be gone. Lukako has become a girl. Her face hasn't changed, and she's flat as a board, but she's definitely a girl. There's no denying what my hand didn't feel. I guess that ridiculous superstition was true. If you eat vegetables, you'll have a girl. Does this count as a scientific breakthrough? Anyway, I'd better apologize to Lukako. I hope she doesn't get PTSD because some pervert (me) groped her. I mean, she's a 17-year-old girl now, and she was shy to begin with. I'll need to be as gentle as humanly possible from now on. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if she never spoke to me again. I have no one but myself to blame. I'll just have to accept the consequences.
Kurisu: Anyway, what in the hell made you think that Urushibara-san was a boy?
Rintaro: Heh heh heh... as I already explained, we changed the past. Lukako was a guy, but he wanted to be a girl, so we sent a D-Mail to make his wish come true. And it worked! I knew the worldline had changed. My magic eye, Reading Steiner, saw the shift in time. But I chose to believe my mundane senses instead. I should have had more faith in my powers! I won't make that mistake again.
