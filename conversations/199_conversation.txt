Itaru: "Porn?"
Mayuri: "No, but the illustrator is Kouga Yui-san. Mayushii thinks it’s finally time to get serious about costumes again."
Itaru: "Kouga Yui? She was the character designer for last year’s Gunbam."
Mayuri: "Yup!"
Itaru: "Buy me one too."
Mayuri: "Okey dokey♪"
Rintaro: "What are you guys talking about? If you want doujinshi, why not go to Toranoana? It’s right over there."
UNSPOKEN: Daru and Mayuri stare at me blankly.
Mayuri: "There, where?"
Rintaro: "You know, there! Right over--"
UNSPOKEN: I follow my pointing finger. Toranoana isn’t there.
Rintaro: "Wha...?"
UNSPOKEN: I rub my eyes and blink several times. It doesn’t help. Maybe I’m looking in the wrong place. I check up and down the street, but no, it’s nowhere to be found. And what’s more, I can’t find Animate either. It’s supposed to be right next to Toranoana. Instead, I see electronics stores. Daiichi Kaden and T-2ONE Minami. Never seen them before in my life. Wait... I remember Mister Braun saying that Akiba used to have a lot more electronics shops. Many of them closed. I think Daiichi Kaden and T-2ONE Minami were among them.
Rintaro: "Where the hell did Toranoana and Animate go!?"
Itaru: "Have you lost it, man?"
Rintaro: "Huh?"
Mayuri: "There aren’t any Toranoanas or Animates in Akiba. That’s why Mayushii’s going to Nakano to buy doujinshi."
Rintaro: "What do you mean there aren’t any!? They were there yesterday, weren’t they!?"
UNSPOKEN: What about earlier today? I wasn’t really paying attention on the way to Faris’s apartment, but I’m pretty sure they were still there.
Itaru: "There’s no moe stores in Akiba, man. You know that. The holy land of moe is Nakano."
Rintaro: "But Akiba is the holy land of moe! The whole world knows that!"
Itaru: "Has the heat finally gone to your head, Okarin? Akiba is the electric town. If you opened a moe store here, the electronics otaku would riot."
UNSPOKEN: This feeling again! Dissonance. My memories don’t match reality. The past has changed. Part of me knows what has happened. But I still can’t help but ask.
Rintaro: "What about Mandarake?"
Mayuri: "Nope."
Rintaro: "Akiba-o!?"
Itaru: "Of course there’s an Akiba-o."
Rintaro: "I mean Akiba-okoku, where they sell doujinshi!"
Itaru: "The hell’s that?"
Mayuri: "They sell doujinshi at Akiba-o?"
Itaru: "Of course not. That would be crazy."
Rintaro: "Gamers!? Ramutara!?"
UNSPOKEN: They shake their heads.
Rintaro: "MelonBooks!? Asobit City!?"
UNSPOKEN: They look confused. So basically... I swallow hard. I finally understand. It’s hard to believe... but I must face the truth.
Rintaro: "Chaos has forsaken this place..."
