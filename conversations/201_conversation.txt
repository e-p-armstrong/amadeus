UNSPOKEN: Thoughts spin inside my head. Every pedestrian looks like an enemy. I flee from the crowd. After I manage to calm myself down, I head back to the lab. For now, I’ll write that mail off as a prank. It’s still early -- well, I guess it’s actually noon -- but Mayuri, Kurisu, and Lukako are already at the lab when I return. I greet them, trying to keep the anxiety out of my voice.
Rintaro: "It’s Sunday. Obon weekend. What are you doing here, lab girls?"
Luka: "Pardon the intrusion, Okabe-san."
Mayuri: "Good morning, Okarin♪"
UNSPOKEN: The two cute high school girls wave to me in greeting. By the way, one of these girls is actually a boy. In any case, the sight warms my heart -- or would, if not for a certain assistant who just gives me a bored look before going back to reading.
Rintaro: "What are you doing?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri and Lukako are sitting next to each other on the sofa, reading a book together. It looks like a cosplay photo album.
Mayuri: "Yesterday I went to Nakano to buy doujinshi, remember? While I was there, I found a photo album of a super cute cosplayer! So I splurged on it♪ Look, Luka-chan! This is a costume of Sedona from Blood Tune. It’s so detailed and cute!"
Luka: "It is!"
UNSPOKEN: I see. She’s showing it to Lukako as part of his reeducation. To think that he was so reluctant to get involved in cosplay. Looks like Mayuri’s persistence has paid off. Actually, judging by his obvious interest in the photo album, maybe he was always interested in cosplay -- just too shy to cosplay himself.
Mayuri: "Take a look, Chris-chan! It’s amazing!"
Kurisu: "I’m okay."
UNSPOKEN: Looks like Kurisu’s not interested in the photo album. She just gives a cold hmph. Instead, she’s reading a difficult-looking English book. Dammit, this is no time to be showing off your intelligence. You’re going to make Mayuri cry if you talk to her like that. Or so I thought, but Mayuri doesn’t seem to mind, so I stay out of it.
Mayuri: "Wow, look at these swimsuits! So much skin! She’s got a great figure, like a gravure idol."
Luka: "Must be nice..."
Mayuri: "Nice? The swimsuits?"
Luka: "I... don’t have that great a figure..."
Mayuri: "Don’t worry, Luka-chan. I’m sure you’ll make our big friends breathe hard."
UNSPOKEN: Hey now, Mayuri. What are you saying? It’s like you’re referring to Daru with that remark.
Mayuri: "And um, plenty of people like flat chests. So even if you don’t have breasts, you should still have confidence in yourself."
Kurisu: "Khmmkhmmkhmm!"
