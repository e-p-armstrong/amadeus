Rintaro: Really?
UNSPOKEN: But it's so damn hot. How can you exercise on a day like this? I'd rather drink hot coffee in a well air-conditioned room while browsing the net. Now that's a luxurious way to spend summer break. If only the lab had air conditioning.
Suzuha: Hey, up for a little cycling?
UNSPOKEN: Seriously? She has to be joking.
Rintaro: Your bike only has one seat.
Suzuha: One of us can sit on the back.
Rintaro: Don't you have work to do?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha pops into the store. She's back in less than a minute.
Suzuha: I got permission. It's not like we'll have customers anyway.
UNSPOKEN: I try to think of an excuse to refuse, but nothing comes.
Rintaro: Huff... huff... I am a mad scientist... not a mad... cyclist... Huff... huff... so why... am I... doing the pedaling?
Suzuha: Long ago, Aristotle said, 'time is just the measure of motion.' So put those pedals in motion.
UNSPOKEN: That doesn't make sense... I'm exhausted. We barely made it to the station. I'd die if I went another block. This was a terrible idea. I should have known better. I get off the bicycle and sit against the station wall. Suzuha sets the bike against the wall and crouches next to me. Sitting on the ground is undignified for a man of my stature, but no matter. I just need a few moments to catch my breath. I watch the crowds of people move past. Nearly all of them are men. Here and there, I see people carrying large boxes, most likely PC parts or appliances. There isn't an anime poster in sight. When Akiba changed, so did the people who visited it. This atmosphere... It's kind of... retro. It's the Akiba I've only seen in pictures. Akiba at the end of the 20th century. The Electric Town in its purest form. It has risen from the ashes of the past. And the only one who knows it... is me.
Suzuha: You know...
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha murmurs.
Suzuha: It's only been ten days since I arrived in Tokyo.
UNSPOKEN: Huh. I didn't know that.
Rintaro: Vacation? No... that can't be right.
Suzuha: I'm hunting for my father.
UNSPOKEN: That's a strange way to put it.
Rintaro: Did he run away?
UNSPOKEN: I meant it as a joke, but Suzuha looks so serious. I hope I didn't screw up again.
Suzuha: I haven't seen him in years. But I know he's in this town.
Rintaro: Oh... but then why are you working downstairs?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha works at the Braun Tube Workshop from 11 AM to 7 PM every day. I doubt that leaves much time to search.
Suzuha: Honestly, I don't have a clue where to begin.
Rintaro: Have you talked to the police?
Suzuha: ...No.
Rintaro: Then shouldn't you? Or you could hire a private investigator or something, if you have money.
Suzuha: I don't have the resources. And besides, there are... issues.
UNSPOKEN: Issues...
Suzuha: I only have one chance. And that chance is tomorrow. I know that tomorrow, he might appear in a certain place.
