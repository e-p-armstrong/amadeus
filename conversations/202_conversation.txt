Luka: "Um... all of the lab mems?"
Kurisu: "I can’t go. I have to go back to America soon, and I haven’t even started packing yet."
Rintaro: "Yes, I can see you’re in a rush. I bet you don’t even have time to lounge around and read."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu snaps her book shut and glares at me.
Kurisu: "Fine, I’ll be blunt. There’s no way I’m swimming with two perverts like you! If it’s just the girl members, I’ll happily go."
Rintaro: "Hmph. Be honest, Christina. You just don’t want me to see the Mongolian Spot on your butt!"
Kurisu: "I don’t have a Mongolian Spot!"
Rintaro: "Anyway, if it’s just the girl members, then doesn’t that rule out Lukako?"
Kurisu: "What’s that supposed to mean?"
Rintaro: "Didn’t we tell you earlier? Lukako is a bonafide guy!"
UNSPOKEN: My declaration of the truth... Freezes the air instantly. ...Huh? There’s something off about their reaction.
Kurisu: "You’re the worst. Where do you get off calling her a guy?"
Mayuri: "Yeah, Okarin. That’s a terrible thing to say."
UNSPOKEN: Even Mayuri condemns me. Lukako, meanwhile, turns pale and hangs his head so I can’t see his face. Is he... crying? Normally, he’d get depressed and say something about how embarrassed he’d be to wear a swimsuit, but he wouldn’t start crying...
Rintaro: "Christina. I understand your desire to deny the truth. It’s difficult to imagine that a guy could ever be so cute, but--"
Kurisu: "Okabe!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu’s advances on me with a stern glare.
Kurisu: "If you want to give me stupid nicknames, that’s fine -- I mean, it’s not, but... What you said just now is below the belt. I didn’t take you for the kind of guy who thinks it’s funny to hurt people’s feelings, but I guess I was wrong. You’re a real jerk, Okabe."
Rintaro: "Huh?"
UNSPOKEN: What did I do to deserve this tongue-lashing?
Kurisu: "Apologize. Apologize to Urushibara-san right now."
Rintaro: "Wait a second. I don’t have to apologize for anything. I just said the tru--"
Luka: "It’s okay."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako gets up from the sofa. His head is still hanging, and his voice is barely audible.
Luka: "So that’s how Okabe-san sees me..."
Rintaro: "No no no! That’s not how I see you, Lukako. You’re a guy, remember!? Or are you denying reality too!?"
Kurisu: "You’re the one denying reality!"
Mayuri: "That’s right! Luka-chan’s a girl, Okarin. You’re terrible."
Rintaro: "Mayuri, when did you start calling Lukako ’Luka-chan’ instead of ’Luka-kun’?"
Kurisu: "Cut it out already, Okabe! She’s a girl!"
