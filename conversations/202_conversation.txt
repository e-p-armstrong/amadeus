Suzuha: If I miss that chance, then I'll have to leave.
Rintaro: By leave, you mean go back home?
Suzuha: Not exactly. I have a parallel, priority engagement.
UNSPOKEN: What?
Suzuha: I've already made up my mind. I don't find him tomorrow, I'll give up.
Rintaro: You're worried, aren't you? I understand that feeling. You're alone, searching for your father in an unfamiliar town. It can't be easy. You hoped that talking to someone would help. That's why you sought out the most reliable person around -- me. Alas, Part-Time Warrior, you have made a grave mistake. For I am the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma!
Suzuha: Uh...
Rintaro: Heh heh heh... you shall be my next guinea pig!
Suzuha: Guinea pig?
Rintaro: You know what I'm talking about. D-Mail, the greatest discovery in the history of science!
UNSPOKEN: I've already explained D-Mail to Suzuha before.
Rintaro: You shall be the subject of our next experiment. Heh heh heh.
Suzuha: Wh-what are you gonna do?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha takes a step back. She finally realizes the danger she's in.
Rintaro: Do? Simple. I need more data, and I'll do anything to obtain it. You're going to change the past. You can change it however you like, but only I will know the difference! If you think that's cruel, then do as you please. But know that you are already caught in my web. You cannot escape. Fear not! I know exactly what you should write in your D-Mail. Heh heh heh... listen well. You're going to send this to your father before he disappeared. 'Don't abandon your daughter.' Muhahahaha!
Suzuha: ...You're a nice guy. You know that?
Rintaro: Wh...at?
Suzuha: I think talking to you really did help.
Rintaro: Are you trying to insult me? I am not a nice guy. I am a mad scientist who experiments on women and children! Now tell me your father's email address! If you don't... Then I shall unleash the power of my right arm! Once it's unsealed, not even I can control it. You may not survive. Consider yourself warned.
Suzuha: Sorry. I can't.
Rintaro: You dare defy me!?
Suzuha: I don't know his email address or his phone number.
Rintaro: ...Oh.
UNSPOKEN: Well, that's a letdown.
Suzuha: That's why tomorrow's my only chance. Thanks for caring, though.
Rintaro: I don't care. I'm just disappointed I couldn't experiment on you.
Suzuha: Anyway, you can send mail to the past? That's amazing! The first time machine ever!
Rintaro: Hmph, of course it's amazing. I am Hououin Kyouma!
Suzuha: Any plans to upgrade it?
Rintaro: Upgrade it?
Suzuha: You know, like sending people to the past or something.
Rintaro: We're working on it.
UNSPOKEN: No good ideas yet, though.
Suzuha: Then let me give you one word of advice. You should leave Makise Kurisu out of it.
Rintaro: What do you have against her, anyway?
Suzuha: Welp. Better get back to the workshop. I only got a 30-minute break. I'll get in trouble if I don't get back soon.
