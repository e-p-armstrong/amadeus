Luka: "I’m going home!"
UNSPOKEN: Lukako tries to slip by me out of the lab. I grab his hand to stop him from leaving.
Rintaro: "Hold it, Lukako! You can’t fool me! You’re as much a man as I am! And I know how to prove it!"
UNSPOKEN: I pin Lukako’s arms and reach for his package. Let’s see what you’re hiding... down... Nothing.
Rintaro: "Oh...?"
Luka: "ah..."
Kurisu: "You..."
Mayuri: "Awawa..."
Rintaro: "Ohhhh? Huh? What? Why?"
UNSPOKEN: I feel around some more.
Luka: "Ugh, no, don’t... Okabe-san, please... stop... sniff."
UNSPOKEN: Nothing. Nada. It should be there. I mean, he’s a guy... isn’t he? An electric current runs through my brain. No way... Yes way. So that’s what happened!
Rintaro: "Lukako, you..."
UNSPOKEN: The D-Mail that I thought had failed... Was actually a success!
Rintaro: "You’re a girl!?"
Kurisu: "That’s what we’ve been saying!"
UNSPOKEN: A half-second later, Kurisu cracks me over the head with her heavy textbook.
Luka: "hic... ugg... egh..."
UNSPOKEN: When my vision clears, Lukako is crying. Mayuri is rubbing her back comfortingly. Kurisu, meanwhile, is glaring down at me like I’m something she scraped off the bottom of her shoe. Daru, who arrived a moment ago, is in the corner, trying not to laugh. Honestly, I can’t blame him.  Righteous High School Girl Makes Perverted College Guy Beg for Forgiveness If I had to put a title to this scene, that’s what it would be. The top of my head is throbbing. Most likely because Kurisu wiped out a hundred million of my precious neurons, envied by scientists the world over. I put a moist towel to my head.
Kurisu: "I want to vivisect your skull and remove your brain for a good washing. Then I’ll submerge it in culture fluid so you can never do anything like that again! Anyway, just be thankful I haven’t reported you to the police."
Rintaro: "Yes ma’am. I’m sorry."
