Kurisu: That would be... nice.
UNSPOKEN: Come to think of it, she has father issues too, doesn't she? Maybe she sympathizes with Suzuha.
Kurisu: Hey, Okabe...
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Kurisu starts fidgeting for some reason.
Kurisu: I'm sorry about before.
Rintaro: Before?
Kurisu: When I hit you with my book. I thought you were just being a pervert. But when I thought about it later, I realized that you were being completely serious. But I acted on impulse, without even considering what you had to say.
Rintaro: Forget it. Regardless of my intentions, the fact of the matter is that I made Lukako cry.
Kurisu: Just to make sure, you're not a perverted scumbag, are you?
Rintaro: Make sure, my ass! Are you trying to apologize or what!?
Kurisu: I just don't want to you to use science as an excuse to be a pervert. Not while I'm helping, at least.
Rintaro: What do you take me for? My friends are precious to me. I may be an insane mad scientist with an IQ of 170, but even I have my limits. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) wouldn't have come this far without you and Daru at my side.
Kurisu: Okabe...
Rintaro: I am Lab Mem 001, the founder of the lab. If my friends are in danger, I'll rush to their aid. And I would tear my own limbs off before I knowingly brought harm to any of you.
Kurisu: Pff...
Rintaro: What's so funny?
Kurisu: That has to be the cheesiest thing you've ever said.
Rintaro: Hmph...
Kurisu: Still, it's nice to hear. The research institute I work at in America is full of talented people from all over the world... but it's not a friendly place. Everyone thinks he or she is the best. You think you have an ego? Over there, scientists hurl insults at each other on a daily basis. Sometimes they even sabotage each other's work. When my thesis was chosen to represent the lab, many of the older men complained. And when I came back here as a kind of reverse exchange student, my classmates were all too afraid to talk to me. Compared to that, your lab is childish... but comfortable.
UNSPOKEN: ...Seems like everyone has their own problems.
Kurisu: You're really concerned about Amane-san, aren't you? That part of you, I can respect. B-but I'm not praising you, okay?
UNSPOKEN: She suddenly blushes for some reason.
Kurisu: I just... you know... thought you should know...
Rintaro: Maybe I...
Kurisu: Eh?
Rintaro: Maybe all I ever wanted was friends.
Kurisu: Okabe...
Rintaro: There aren't many people I can trust...
UNSPOKEN: After all, I am an insane mad scientist wanted the world over. My enemies are everywhere waiting to strike! Curse this incredible genius brain of mine! Muhahaha!
Kurisu: I, um... think of you as a friend too.
Rintaro: ...What?
Kurisu: You said I was your friend, remember? You said I was important to you. That made me really... happy, I guess.
Rintaro: Do you have a fever?
Kurisu: No! What the hell!? Here I am trying to find something decent about you, and you... I don't care anymore, stupid! You're really... stupid.
