UNSPOKEN: It only gets worse. The smoke grows thicker by the second, filling my lungs with ash and tar. In less than an hour, the girls have transformed the lab into a class five disaster zone! I take out my phone and put it to my ear.
Rintaro: It's me. Looks like the Evil One is free. If you haven't heard from me in an hour... tell my parents I love them.
Itaru: Okarin, that's a death flag...
Rintaro: Is this the choice of Steins Gate? El Psy Kongroo...
UNSPOKEN: After the storm has passed...
Itaru: Hwahhhh...
Rintaro: ...She's late.
UNSPOKEN: The sun has already set. The food lined up on the table -- none of it looking particularly appetizing -- has already grown cold. I open my phone to check the time. It's getting late. The high school girls will need to head back soon. Was Suzuha able to meet her father? If so, they might have a lot to talk about.
Rintaro: ...!
UNSPOKEN: There's only one word in Suzuha's email. Does that mean she didn't meet her father!? And now she plans to leave town alone!?
Rintaro: Hououin Kyouma will never accept that! She will be my guinea pig whether she likes it or not!
UNSPOKEN: I fly out of the lab. I don't know where Suzuha is. All I can do for now is go to the station. If she's going to leave town, she should be using public transportation. If she's using the Hibiya Line on the other side of the station, then I've struck out. But if she's going to take the bullet train from Tokyo or Ueno, then she'll have to pass through here. I carefully scan the thinning crowd around Akiba Station. Where is she? After about thirty minutes of watching the crowd, I spot something.
Rintaro: ...!
UNSPOKEN: My gaze focuses on a person walking in from the main street. It's Suzuha, shuffling along with her head bowed. As she gets closer, I can see that she's wiping her eyes. Is she crying? I don't see anyone walking with her. I guess she couldn't find her father after all.
Rintaro: You there! Part-Time Warrior!
