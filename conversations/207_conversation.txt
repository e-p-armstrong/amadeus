UNSPOKEN: I give chase, ignoring the stares of passers-by. ...She's gone. Dammit! Where did she... Hold on a second. Why am I chasing her? Do I have some kind of urge to chase things that run away? That's stupid. I'm not a dog! Shouldn't I just leave her be? It's not like we're that close, right?
Suzuha: ...You're a nice guy. You know that? I think talking to you really did help.
UNSPOKEN: But Suzuha is all alone in this town. What if I was the only one she could talk to about her father? I know she's hurting. She needs my help. Shouldn't I do everything in my power?
Rintaro: ...!?
UNSPOKEN: Just now, I think I saw someone who looked like Suzuha. But the run from the station has left me exhausted. I drop to my knees, gasping for breath. My sides ache. I can't take another step. Even after searching the entire area around the station, I couldn't find Suzuha. I guess this, too, is the choice of Steins Gate. As I rest, I look up at the night sky. The satellite remains buried in Radi-Kan's wall. I wipe the sweat off my brow and head back to the lab.
Mayuri: Okarin! Did you find Suzu-san?
UNSPOKEN: Everyone's still there when I return.
Rintaro: It's late. Go home, everyone.
Luka: But...
Kurisu: Tell us what happened.
Itaru: Yeah. Keep us in the loop, man.
Rintaro: Suzuha ran away from me. I guess she couldn't find her father.
Mayuri: Oh...
UNSPOKEN: A gloomy silence falls. I can see the sadness on everyone's face.
Rintaro: Heh... heh heh heh...
UNSPOKEN: I begin to laugh.
Rintaro: MUHAHAHAHA!
Luka: O-Okabe-san? What's wrong? Are you okay?
Kurisu: His brain is probably oxygen-starved from too much running.
Itaru: Okarin... chill.
Rintaro: Heh, look at you all! Why the long faces, friends!? Have you forgotten? We have just the thing for moments like these!
UNSPOKEN: I thrust my finger at the curtain to the development room.
Kurisu: You're going to send a D-Mail?
Itaru: But the discharge phenomenon won't occur this late, will it?
Rintaro: Then we'll send it tomorrow.
UNSPOKEN: D-Mails leap through time. It matters not when we send it, but when it is received.
Mayuri: Who are you sending it to?
Rintaro: To myself this afternoon. The message...
UNSPOKEN: I smile triumphantly.
Rintaro: Don't listen to Christina. Pursue Suzuha!'
