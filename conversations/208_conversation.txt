Kurisu: "Nice?"
Rintaro: "Anyway, I’m going to tail her now. You guys--"
Kurisu: "No! Get it through your thick skull!"
Rintaro: "Dammit, assistant! How dare you give me orders!?"
UNSPOKEN: In the end, I can’t get permission to tail Suzuha.
Kurisu: "Don’t even think about running off somewhere."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu is forcing me to help her with the shopping. There’s no way out. Dammit... Kurisu really is turning into a class president character. At this rate, she might take over the lab. Wait. Could this be what Suzuha was warning me about? ...Nah.
Kurisu: "Anyway..."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu scratches her cheek in what could be taken for a bashful gesture.
Kurisu: "I hope Amane-san finds her father."
Rintaro: "Yeah."
Kurisu: "That would be... nice."
UNSPOKEN: Come to think of it, she has father issues too, doesn’t she? Maybe she sympathizes with Suzuha.
Kurisu: "Hey, Okabe..."
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Kurisu starts fidgeting for some reason.
Kurisu: "I’m sorry about before."
Rintaro: "Before?"
Kurisu: "When I hit you with my book. I thought you were just being a pervert. But when I thought about it later, I realized that you were being completely serious. But I acted on impulse, without even considering what you had to say."
Rintaro: "Forget it. Regardless of my intentions, the fact of the matter is that I made Lukako cry."
Kurisu: "Just to make sure, you’re not a perverted scumbag, are you?"
Rintaro: "Make sure, my ass! Are you trying to apologize or what!?"
Kurisu: "I just don’t want to you to use science as an excuse to be a pervert. Not while I’m helping, at least."
Rintaro: "What do you take me for? My friends are precious to me. I may be an insane mad scientist with an IQ of 170, but even I have my limits. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) wouldn’t have come this far without you and Daru at my side."
Kurisu: "Okabe..."
Rintaro: "I am Lab Mem 001, the founder of the lab. If my friends are in danger, I’ll rush to their aid. And I would tear my own limbs off before I knowingly brought harm to any of you."
Kurisu: "Pff..."
Rintaro: "What’s so funny?"
Kurisu: "That has to be the cheesiest thing you’ve ever said."
Rintaro: "Hmph..."
Kurisu: "Still, it’s nice to hear. The research institute I work at in America is full of talented people from all over the world... but it’s not a friendly place. Everyone thinks he or she is the best. You think you have an ego? Over there, scientists hurl insults at each other on a daily basis. Sometimes they even sabotage each other’s work. When my thesis was chosen to represent the lab, many of the older men complained. And when I came back here as a kind of reverse exchange student, my classmates were all too afraid to talk to me. Compared to that, your lab is childish... but comfortable."
