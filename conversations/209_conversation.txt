UNSPOKEN: She suddenly blushes for some reason.
Kurisu: "I just... you know... thought you should know..."
Rintaro: "Maybe I..."
Kurisu: "Eh?"
Rintaro: "Maybe all I ever wanted was friends."
Kurisu: "Okabe..."
Rintaro: "There aren’t many people I can trust..."
UNSPOKEN: After all, I am an insane mad scientist wanted the world over. My enemies are everywhere waiting to strike! Curse this incredible genius brain of mine! Muhahaha!
Kurisu: "I, um... think of you as a friend too."
Rintaro: "...What?"
Kurisu: "You said I was your friend, remember? You said I was important to you. That made me really... happy, I guess."
Rintaro: "Do you have a fever?"
Kurisu: "No! What the hell!? Here I am trying to find something decent about you, and you... I don’t care anymore, stupid! You’re really... stupid."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu squares her shoulders and quickly walks ahead. I give chase. What just happened? Is this girl planning something? Maybe she really is plotting to take over the lab. No, wait. Maybe she’s trying to sabotage the party because she doesn’t like Suzuha. Hmph. No mere assistant is going to pull one over on the great Hououin Kyouma! Anyway, time to get my head in the game. We must prepare for the Last Supper, Operation Eldhrimnir. The Last Supper refers to our party for Suzuha. In the event she reunites with her father, we’ll just celebrate normally. In other words, it will be her last supper in Tokyo. However... If she doesn’t reunite with her father, we’ll kidnap her and force her to participate in our experiments. Sacrifices must be made if we’re going to perfect D-Mail technology. In that case, it will be the last supper on this worldline. The lab’s budget -- most of which comes out of my pocket -- is tight, but it’s okay to party every once in a while. There’s no such thing as low-risk, high-return. High-risk, high-return. That is how a mad scientist operates. Muhaha, I can already taste Suzuha’s despair!
Kurisu: "Huh? Over there, isn’t that..."
UNSPOKEN: I follow Kurisu’s finger to see Daru emerge from Yodobashi Camera.
Rintaro: "Found you, Daru!"
Itaru: "Huh? Ah--"
UNSPOKEN: I grab his collar to stop him from escaping.
Rintaro: "Why didn’t you respond to my summons?"
Itaru: "Like I said, I’ve got something to do."
Rintaro: "Which is?"
Itaru: "An offline meet..."
Rintaro: "Inexcusable."
Itaru: "Wait, just listen a sec--"
Rintaro: "Your offline meet, or a party with food handmade by our very own lab girls. Choose one."
Itaru: "Handmade... by girls? O-one question. Will Faris-tan be there?"
UNSPOKEN: Before Kurisu can answer that, I whisper to Daru.
Rintaro: "Naturally. Faris is a lab mem too. Heh heh heh."
Itaru: "Dammit! Why do they have to be on the same day!? Can’t it wait until tomorrow?"
Rintaro: "What will it be? The time to choose is now."
