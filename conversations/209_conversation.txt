UNSPOKEN: Suzuha hesitates a little. Then she stands up and turns to me. Her expression is grave.
Suzuha: My father calls himself Titor.
Rintaro: Wait, Titor? As in that Titor!?
Suzuha: You know about him? He might be using a different codename, though.
UNSPOKEN: I don't just know about him. He's been active on @channel for the past several weeks! I open the @channel thread on my phone and show it to Suzuha.
Rintaro: Look! There's someone posting named John Titor!
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha stares at the screen.
Rintaro: This solves the puzzle! Your father is on @channel!
Suzuha: Huh... you're right.
Rintaro: Hey. Shouldn't you be more surprised?
Suzuha: Well... it's not him.
Rintaro: How do you know? You just said your father calls himself Titor!
Suzuha: I can tell. This Titor isn't my dad.
UNSPOKEN: That's a strange way to put it. It's almost like she knows who's behind John Titor. As if to answer my suspicions, Suzuha continues.
Suzuha: His name's not John. The name my father used was... Barrel Titor.
