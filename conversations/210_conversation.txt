Rintaro: "If you give up the offline meet, then that settles it."
Itaru: "I give up. I give up the offline meeeet!"
UNSPOKEN: Daru surrenders all too quickly. When we return to the lab, Mayuri and Lukako are already starting preparations.
Mayuri: "Huh? Daru-kun’s here too?"
Itaru: "What about Faris-tan? Where is she?"
Kurisu: "You’ve been tricked."
Mayuri: "Feris-chan said she couldn’t come."
Itaru: "Wait, seriously!? Okarin! What’s going on here!? This isn’t funny, man!"
Rintaro: "Don’t worry. I’ll make sure she comes to the next one."
Itaru: "You’ve gotta be kidding me! I was looking forward to that time machine meet..."
Kurisu: "Time machine meet? What’s that?"
Itaru: "It’s an offline meet for this sci-fi BBS I post on. Some famous writers are going to be there. I won’t forgive you, Okarin. Ever."
Rintaro: "What? Why didn’t you say so? I would’ve gone too!"
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, I smell something strange.
Rintaro: "...Does anyone else smell that?"
Kurisu: "Smell what?"
Rintaro: "Did we blow a fuse somewhere?"
Luka: "S-sorry..."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako’s apologizing for something.
Luka: "That’s probably the smell of... Mayuri’s cooking..."
UNSPOKEN: ...What? This is the smell of food!?
Kurisu: "I’ll help too."
Luka: "Okay, then warm these eggs please."
Kurisu: "Hm. Should I use the PhoneWave?"
Luka: "N-no! If you put raw eggs in a microwave, they’ll explode!"
Kurisu: "We took the door off. It should be fine, right?"
Mayuri: "Chop, chop, choppity chop, chop, chop, choppity..."
Luka: "M-Mayuri-chan! Don’t hold your knife like that!"
UNSPOKEN: What the hell is going on here? Daru and I exchange glances.
Rintaro: "Maybe we should help too. Or at least kick them out of the kitchen?"
Itaru: "Won’t it end up the same either way?"
Rintaro: "I’m getting dizzy. This isn’t the future I was hoping for."
Itaru: "You’re telling me. I’ll never forget this, Okarin. Never."
Rintaro: "I’m sorry. Truly. But please, Daru, stay with me to the end."
Itaru: "I’ll order pizza as insurance."
UNSPOKEN: It only gets worse. The smoke grows thicker by the second, filling my lungs with ash and tar. In less than an hour, the girls have transformed the lab into a class five disaster zone! I take out my phone and put it to my ear.
Rintaro: "It’s me. Looks like the Evil One is free. If you haven’t heard from me in an hour... tell my parents I love them."
Itaru: "Okarin, that’s a death flag..."
Rintaro: "Is this the choice of Steins Gate? El Psy Kongroo..."
UNSPOKEN: After the storm has passed...
Itaru: "Hwahhhh..."
Rintaro: "...She’s late."
