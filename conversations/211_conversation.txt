UNSPOKEN: There’s only one word in Suzuha’s email. Does that mean she didn’t meet her father!? And now she plans to leave town alone!?
Rintaro: "Hououin Kyouma will never accept that! She will be my guinea pig whether she likes it or not!"
UNSPOKEN: I fly out of the lab. I don’t know where Suzuha is. All I can do for now is go to the station. If she’s going to leave town, she should be using public transportation. If she’s using the Hibiya Line on the other side of the station, then I’ve struck out. But if she’s going to take the bullet train from Tokyo or Ueno, then she’ll have to pass through here. I carefully scan the thinning crowd around Akiba Station. Where is she? After about thirty minutes of watching the crowd, I spot something.
Rintaro: "...!"
UNSPOKEN: My gaze focuses on a person walking in from the main street. It’s Suzuha, shuffling along with her head bowed. As she gets closer, I can see that she’s wiping her eyes. Is she crying? I don’t see anyone walking with her. I guess she couldn’t find her father after all.
Rintaro: "You there! Part-Time Warrior!"
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha looks up in surprise. I see the tracks of tears on her face. Just as our eyes are about to meet, Suzuha looks away. And then she turns and runs out of the station.
Rintaro: "Wait!"
UNSPOKEN: I give chase, ignoring the stares of passers-by. ...She’s gone. Dammit! Where did she... Hold on a second. Why am I chasing her? Do I have some kind of urge to chase things that run away? That’s stupid. I’m not a dog! Shouldn’t I just leave her be? It’s not like we’re that close, right?
Suzuha: "...You’re a nice guy. You know that? I think talking to you really did help."
UNSPOKEN: But Suzuha is all alone in this town. What if I was the only one she could talk to about her father? I know she’s hurting. She needs my help. Shouldn’t I do everything in my power?
Rintaro: "...!?"
UNSPOKEN: Just now, I think I saw someone who looked like Suzuha. But the run from the station has left me exhausted. I drop to my knees, gasping for breath. My sides ache. I can’t take another step. Even after searching the entire area around the station, I couldn’t find Suzuha. I guess this, too, is the choice of Steins Gate. As I rest, I look up at the night sky. The satellite remains buried in Radi-Kan’s wall. I wipe the sweat off my brow and head back to the lab.
Mayuri: "Okarin! Did you find Suzu-san?"
UNSPOKEN: Everyone’s still there when I return.
Rintaro: "It’s late. Go home, everyone."
Luka: "But..."
Kurisu: "Tell us what happened."
Itaru: "Yeah. Keep us in the loop, man."
Rintaro: "Suzuha ran away from me. I guess she couldn’t find her father."
