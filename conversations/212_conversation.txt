UNSPOKEN: A gloomy silence falls. I can see the sadness on everyone’s face.
Rintaro: "Heh... heh heh heh..."
UNSPOKEN: I begin to laugh.
Rintaro: "MUHAHAHAHA!"
Luka: "O-Okabe-san? What’s wrong? Are you okay?"
Kurisu: "His brain is probably oxygen-starved from too much running."
Itaru: "Okarin... chill."
Rintaro: "Heh, look at you all! Why the long faces, friends!? Have you forgotten? We have just the thing for moments like these!"
UNSPOKEN: I thrust my finger at the curtain to the development room.
Kurisu: "You’re going to send a D-Mail?"
Itaru: "But the discharge phenomenon won’t occur this late, will it?"
Rintaro: "Then we’ll send it tomorrow."
UNSPOKEN: D-Mails leap through time. It matters not when we send it, but when it is received.
Mayuri: "Who are you sending it to?"
Rintaro: "To myself this afternoon. The message..."
UNSPOKEN: I smile triumphantly.
Rintaro: "Don’t listen to Christina. Pursue Suzuha!’"
UNSPOKEN: If I do that, there’s no way I can fail. And then, we can have Suzuha as a test subject! I suddenly hear the sound of rain. I look outside the window and see that rain has started to fall. As Daru predicted, the discharge phenomenon does not occur. It looks like we’ll have to wait until tomorrow. The rain grows stronger over time, eventually becoming a thunderstorm. The next day, there isn’t a cloud in the sky. It’s hard to believe it rained all night. I keep checking the Braun Tube Workshop through the window, but the morning passes without any sign of Suzuha. She’s probably long gone from Akiba by now. Heh heh heh... she doesn’t know who she’s dealing with. She is but a pawn in my game, destined to fight for me at Ragnarok. At the stroke of noon, I activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change). The destination is my phone, yesterday around 4 PM. The discharge phenomenon occurs as normal. The floor shakes violently. Squinting against the glare, I send the mail. My brain shakes violently. My vision flickers. As the vertigo passes, I can hear my heartbeat and feel the warm blood coursing through my body. I blink slowly. That was the sensation of Reading Steiner activating. And so I know. Suzuha is ours. I hurry down the stairs. I step outside and look to the front of the building. What belongs there has returned. A mountain bike polished to a shining finish. And on the bench next to it, looking up into the summer sky, is... Amane Suzuha.
Rintaro: "...Good morning, Part-Time Warrior."
UNSPOKEN: I try to remain calm as I call out to her.
Suzuha: "Sup."
UNSPOKEN: She greets me in her usual listless fashion.
Rintaro: "Slacking off?"
Suzuha: "It’s not like anyone’s gonna come. And besides, I was up all night partying. I’m really tired."
Rintaro: "You were partying? With who?"
Suzuha: "Were you drinking, Okabe Rintaro? Big no-no. You’re only eighteen."
