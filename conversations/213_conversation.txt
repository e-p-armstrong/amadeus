Rintaro: "You couldn’t find your father, so we held the ’Last Supper’ to make you a test subject. Correct?"
Suzuha: "Ahaha! Yeah, I remember you saying something like that. Thanks for all your help yesterday."
Rintaro: "...My memory’s a bit fuzzy. Remind me again how we captured you."
Suzuha: "Wait, were you really drinking last night?"
Rintaro: "Just tell me."
Suzuha: "Well, I was on my way home from the time machine meet when--"
Rintaro: "Woah, wait a second. Time machine meet!?"
Suzuha: "Yup."
UNSPOKEN: That’s the same offline meet that Daru was going to...
Rintaro: "Was that where your father was supposed to appear?"
Suzuha: "I said so yesterday, didn’t I?"
Rintaro: "So you were going home, and then?"
Suzuha: "You, Hashida Itaru, and Shiina Mayuri appeared out of nowhere. You brought me to the lab, and we partied all night long."
UNSPOKEN: So my pursuit of Suzuha was a resounding success. I can’t help but smile at how smoothly things went. Suzuha, meanwhile, looks back up at the clear blue sky.
Suzuha: "Yesterday sure was fun..."
UNSPOKEN: Her tone is sincere.
Suzuha: "It would’ve been more fun if not for Makise Kurisu. The apple pie she made was deadly. But Urushibara Luka’s curry was awesome. Your lab seems kinda like... umm... like a clubhouse? It’s nice. Everyone gets along, and you’re always smiling... I’ve never had so much fun in my life."
UNSPOKEN: Hmm. It sounds like Suzuha had a pretty dark childhood. Maybe she was bullied in school. Could that be related to her father’s disappearance?
Rintaro: "Part-Time Warrior. As promised, you are now my test subject."
Suzuha: "But I already told you. I don’t know his email address."
Rintaro: "Then we’ll have to postpone the experiment until you find out. By the way, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) used in the experiment is our lab’s greatest secret. You must become a lab mem to guarantee your silence."
Suzuha: "Lab mem?"
Rintaro: "Short for laboratory member. When you become a lab mem, you become one of us."
Suzuha: "...Can I really join?"
Rintaro: "You don’t have a choice in the matter! From this day forth, you are Lab Mem 008!"
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha lowers her head, no doubt awed by my proclamation. I hear what sounds like a sniffle. Then she looks up, revealing a smile.
Suzuha: "I guess I don’t have a choice, huh? I’m all yours."
Rintaro: "...You’re not going to leave?"
Suzuha: "Nope. Maybe there’s still a chance to find my dad."
Rintaro: "You are a lab mem now. If there’s anything we can do, you need only ask. By the way, do you have any leads?"
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha hesitates a little. Then she stands up and turns to me. Her expression is grave.
Suzuha: "My father calls himself Titor."
Rintaro: "Wait, Titor? As in that Titor!?"
Suzuha: "You know about him? He might be using a different codename, though."
