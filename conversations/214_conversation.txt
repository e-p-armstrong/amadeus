UNSPOKEN: Suzuha stares at the screen.
Rintaro: "This solves the puzzle! Your father is on @channel!"
Suzuha: "Huh... you’re right."
Rintaro: "Hey. Shouldn’t you be more surprised?"
Suzuha: "Well... it’s not him."
Rintaro: "How do you know? You just said your father calls himself Titor!"
Suzuha: "I can tell. This Titor isn’t my dad."
UNSPOKEN: That’s a strange way to put it. It’s almost like she knows who’s behind John Titor. As if to answer my suspicions, Suzuha continues.
Suzuha: "His name’s not John. The name my father used was... Barrel Titor."
