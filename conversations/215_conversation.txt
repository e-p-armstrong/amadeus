UNSPOKEN: This is a dream, right?
Mayuri: "Mayushii went looking for you, and found Okarins from many, maaaany worldlines. You’re one of many Okarins, and also the original. Mayushii is one of many Mayushiis, and also the original. And now, Okarin and Mayushii are going to die here."
UNSPOKEN: This is a dream... right, Mayuri?
Mayuri: "But... I know that another Okarin and Mayushii will pick up where we left off, 70 million years in the future. So everything’s A-OK♪"
Rintaro: "This... is a dream! Guh!"
UNSPOKEN: I jerk awake on top of the sofa. My body is drenched in sweat.
Rintaro: "...It was a dream."
UNSPOKEN: I must have fallen asleep some time around noon. What a horrible nightmare. I guess that threatening email I got is still weighing on my mind. Still, Mayuri had to save me? Even in a dream, that’s unacceptable. I’m the one who saves her. That’s the way it should be. Besides, Mayuri’s not smart enough to talk about time travel like that.  I sit up and look around the room. She’s right where I expect to find her. In front of the TV, watching a RaiNet Kakeru DVD. On the screen, the Upa riding Kakeru’s shoulder is screaming something unintelligible.
Mayuri: "I wish I had an Upa..."
UNSPOKEN: Look at her sitting there all spaced out. Mayuri needs my protection. That dream was wrong. I chug a Dr P and check my phone. No new emails. I sent Titor a mail several hours ago, just to make sure that he really isn’t Suzuha’s father. He hasn’t replied yet. Obviously, Daru and the others don’t know that I changed the past. Instead, they remember partying with Suzuha all night long. It was strange listening to them talk happily about an event I attended, but do not remember. ...Wait, is that my phone ringing? Ugh... One look at the name makes me want to groan. It’s Faris. I’ve said it a thousand times, but I’m just not good with that catgirl. She always ties me into knots. My instincts tell me not to pick up.
Rintaro: "This is Hououin Kyouma."
Faris: "Nyaon♪ It’s Faris, nyan."
Rintaro: "Oh, it’s you, Akiha Rumiho."
Faris: "Nya? Who’s that, nya?"
UNSPOKEN: Hm? I could’ve sworn her real name was Akiha Rumiho. Don’t tell me... Could the D-Mail have changed that too?
Faris: "Faris is Faris, nya. I don’t have any other names, nya."
Rintaro: "Yeah, right. Your True Name is Faris. My apologies."
UNSPOKEN: Of course. She’s just being her usual self.
Rintaro: "Well, what is it?"
