Rintaro: Whoa!
UNSPOKEN: In less than a minute, the rain turns into a full downpour. We had no time to seek shelter.
Kurisu: What the hell!?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's scream is drowned out by the roar of the rain.
Kurisu: Whew, what a surprise.
Rintaro: That's what you get for tempting the sky gods.
UNSPOKEN: Now safely inside the building, we take a moment to catch our breath. It's been a week since Suzuha's time machine disappeared, but Radi-Kan is still closed. The lights are off, and it's pretty dark inside.
Kurisu: You should've warned me sooner. Even my underwear's soaked.
Rintaro: Same here. I bet you're glad it's dark, huh?
Kurisu: What do you mean?
Rintaro: If the lights were on, I'd be able to see everything.
Kurisu: ...!
UNSPOKEN: Even in the dim light, I can tell that Kurisu is scrambling to cover her chest.
Kurisu: Ugh, I forgot that you're a perv too.
Rintaro: You're the one who announced that your underwear was wet.
Kurisu: J-just drop it! If you're imagining what color my underwear is, I'll kill you!
Rintaro: I'm not imagining anything.
UNSPOKEN: She's too self-conscious. But... the color of her underwear, huh? Hmmm... gotta be white.
Kurisu: Achoo!
Rintaro: Cold?
Kurisu: I'm not stripping naked, if that's what you're suggesting! Your pervy tricks won't work on me!
Rintaro: Who said strip!? Calm down, will you!?
Kurisu: Grr...
Rintaro: But if you want to strip, go right ahead. I can't make out your scrawny figure in this light anyway.
Kurisu: Another word, and I'll make you eat your cerebral neocortex with ponzu sauce!
Rintaro: S-sorry.
UNSPOKEN: Please, spare me that horror. Still, these wisecracks are a welcome distraction.
Kurisu: A storm like that shouldn't last long. Guess we'll just wait it out.
UNSPOKEN: I see Kurisu's shadowy form move to sit on the staircase. I sit next to her.
Kurisu: H-hey, get your own stair! W-what?
Rintaro: You're the one who said not to speak.
Kurisu: Y-you're too close... Don't come any closer, okay? You can stay where you are, but come any closer, and I'll push you away, okay?
UNSPOKEN: Our bodies gradually grow cold. We start shivering. Maybe I should take off my wet clothes. But if I do that, Kurisu will just call me a perv again. Better not. My eyes gradually adjust to the darkness. I can see Kurisu more clearly now. She's huddled up against the wall.
Kurisu: ...Don't look at me.
Rintaro: Impossible! How can you see where I'm looking!?
UNSPOKEN: Does she have infravision!?
Kurisu: So you were looking.
UNSPOKEN: Damn! She used Leading Question on me. That's such a high-level technique. I avert my eyes from Kurisu and take off my lab coat. That's when I notice my coat is torn at the shoulder.
Rintaro: Damn. Must have caught on something when we ran inside.
Kurisu: What are you talking about?
Rintaro: Just a little tear in my coat.
Kurisu: Is clumsiness one of your character traits?
Rintaro: Don't be ridiculous. I am a mad scientist. I bear the curse of insanity, not clumsiness.
UNSPOKEN: It seems like forever since I've talked to Kurisu as Hououin Kyouma.
Kurisu: Yeah, yeah.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu suddenly holds out her hand.
Kurisu: Give it here.
Rintaro: What?
Kurisu: I happen to have a sewing kit with me. I'll stitch it up for you.
Rintaro: A sewing kit? You?
Kurisu: Something wrong with that?
UNSPOKEN: I hand over my coat as asked.
Rintaro: You're an experiment-loving girl. You're not supposed to be... domestic.
Kurisu: Can't I be a domestic experiment-loving girl?
Rintaro: You? Domestic?
Kurisu: Relatively, maybe. Well, actually, I don't know the domesticity index for Japanese high school girls these days.
