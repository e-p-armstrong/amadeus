Kurisu: It's wet, so it's kinda hard to thread.
Okabe: ...Did you really just happen to have that on you?
Kurisu: Get over it already. Is it really so wrong for me to have a sewing kit?
Okabe: It's not wrong. It just seems like you planned for this.
Kurisu: So you're saying I brought it with me because I somehow knew your coat was going to get ripped. Uh-huh. Ridiculous. And before you get the wrong idea, I'm not fixing your coat because I want to or anything, okay?
Okabe: Nice tsundere line.
Kurisu: Don't mock me. You just happened to tear your clothes, and I just happened to have a sewing kit handy when you did. It's coincidence. That's all.
Okabe: Coincidence... Hey... you didn't time leap, did you?
Kurisu: So now you're saying that I went back in time for the sole purpose of repairing your stupid lab coat. Uh-huh. Ridiculous. Ridiculous! There. It's so important I said it twice. Comprendes?
Okabe: You're right. If you had time leaped, you would've brought a towel, not a sewing kit.
Kurisu: What's that, sarcasm? All you do is complain.
UNSPOKEN: After working for a while, Kurisu cuts the string with her teeth, then hands me back my coat.
Kurisu: Here.
Okabe: Thanks.
Kurisu: Um, by the way... it was dark, so I couldn't really see. If it turns out bad, it's not my fault. It was dark. That's all. Oh, and I hope you like the color. Because I have no idea which thread I used.
Okabe: It's... random?
Kurisu: Black, red, or pink. Those are the three possibilities.
Okabe: Let's just hope it's not pink...
Kurisu: Achoo!
Okabe: Cold?
Kurisu: I guess.
Okabe: Take my coat.
Kurisu: But it's wet.
Okabe: Well, yeah, but...
UNSPOKEN: Silence again. The words flow so naturally when it's just harmless banter, but one second of silence, and suddenly we have nothing to say. It must be because of what happened yesterday. I'm so desperate to avoid the topic that nothing seems safe. I know I need to say something, but what?
Kurisu: ...Have you made your decision yet?
UNSPOKEN: Her voice is barely a whisper, but I can hear her clearly in the silence of the empty stairwell. I look at Kurisu. She's hugging her knees to her chest, presumably against the cold. My decision. I know what she means. That's why I can't answer.
Kurisu: Sigh... You still haven't made up your mind? You like Mayuri, don't you?
Okabe: What?
UNSPOKEN: Where did that come from? Kurisu keeps staring into the darkness.
Kurisu: It's probably just my imagination, but lately, I've been seeing things. Like a strange sort of deja vu. In these visions, you're fighting to save Mayuri all by yourself. You never give up, no matter how much it hurts.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu, too?
Kurisu: Then you come to me for help. You're so desperate, so earnest, that I just have to do what I can. N-not that I'm doing it for you, okay!? I just want to save Mayuri, that's all. Anyway, these images are stuck in my head, like memories.
UNSPOKEN: So Kurisu's the same. She still has faint memories from previous worldlines.
Kurisu: I tried self-analysis. Maybe I'm mistaking dreams for reality, projecting my hopes and fantasies... I don't know. But there's one thing I do know. You have to save Mayuri.
Okabe: ...Aren't you afraid?
UNSPOKEN: To save Mayuri, I must undo the current worldline. If I do that, Kurisu will die.
Kurisu: You know, it kinda feels like we're trapped in an ancient ruin.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu suddenly changes the subject. She looks around the dark, empty stairwell.
Kurisu: Like the world ended... And we're the only two people left. I've been thinking. Say you go to the Beta worldline, and everyone else goes with you. What if I can't go with you? What if I'm the only one left behind? Would the entire world become like this place? It's just a theory... but I can't help but wonder.
