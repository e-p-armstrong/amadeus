Rintaro: "Hah?"
UNSPOKEN: More of Faris’s usual nonsense?
Faris: "The Four Guardian Kings have awakened, nya. There’s no escape, nyan."
Rintaro: "Heh. Is that so? If you think the Four Guardian Kings can stop me, just wait and see. Akiba will be drowning in blood before nightfall."
Faris: "After the Four Guardian Kings are the Four Guardian Queens, nya. After that, it’s the Eight Devils, and then the Black Angel Twelve, nya."
Rintaro: "Th-that many!? What’s going on in this town..."
Faris: "You’ve really stirred up a hornet’s nest, nya. I’m sorry, Kyouma, but this is checkmate, nyan."
Rintaro: "No, it’s not over yet. If I can just acquire the item, I can turn the tide! Have you still not located an IBN 5100!?"
Faris: "Sorry, nya. I have agents looking all over the world, but still no luck, nya."
UNSPOKEN: What, so she has no progress to report?
Rintaro: "Please hurry. I’m running out of time."
Faris: "Okay, nya! I’ll tell you as soon as I find one, Kyouma. Until then... hold on to your nine lives, nyan."
Rintaro: "Yeah, I can’t die yet... El Psy Ko--"
UNSPOKEN: She hung up before I could finish. Dammit. That’s why I hate talking to Faris. Anyway, moving on. Even though I think I should answer it, my hand refuses to move. My phone eventually goes silent. I wipe the sweat off my brow in relief. A second later, Mayuri’s phone starts ringing.
Mayuri: "Tutturu♪ Mayushii here. Ah, Feris-chan. Good mornyan♪"
UNSPOKEN: I twitch when I hear that name. Mayuri looks at me.
Mayuri: "Kyouma? Oh, you mean Okarin? Yup, he’s here. Wanna talk to him?"
UNSPOKEN: I make an X with my arms and shake my head. Faris is the last person I want to talk to now.
Mayuri: "Hmm? Um, it looks like he can’t talk. ...yup. ...mmhmm. Ok, I’ll tell him. Byebye♪"
UNSPOKEN: I stride up to Mayuri once she hangs up.
Rintaro: "Well done, Mayuri. You’ll make a fine assistant yet. What did Faris want?"
Mayuri: "Well, she said that the Four Guardian Kings have assembled in Akiba, so be careful."
UNSPOKEN: Who are the Four Guardian Kings? No, there’s no need to worry about it. It’s just Faris’s usual nonsense.
Rintaro: "Don’t tell me that’s all she said?"
Mayuri: "Um, she also hasn’t found an IBN 5100 yet. She said if she does find one, she’ll contact you nyan."
