UNSPOKEN: I need to say it.
Rintaro: I'll save you. Not just Mayuri, but--
Kurisu: Don't make promises you can't keep!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu cuts me off sharply, then buries her face in her knees.
Kurisu: You asked me if I wasn't afraid. ...Of course I'm afraid. Maybe I'll disappear. Maybe I'll be left behind all alone. Or maybe only you will disappear and everything else will stay the same. The world will continue, and nobody will even know that you existed. I'll go back to America as if nothing ever happened. Maybe... maybe... maybe! I feel hopeless, just thinking about all the possibilities. But even so!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu raises her head and spears me with her glare.
Kurisu: Do you think I would tell you to let Mayuri die!?
Rintaro: Kurisu...
Kurisu: Jesus, it's cold!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu grabs her own arms. In the darkness, I see her shoulders shaking.
Kurisu: It's because of these wet clothes! This sucks. Anyway, enough of this nonsense. It's nothing but conjecture. Baseless. Worthless. I want to cut open my skull and excise the part of my brain that comes up with these delusions.
UNSPOKEN: Now she's talking to herself in an angry tone. Kurisu has always been calm when faced with the unknown. I admired her for that. I thought she was facing this calmly too. But I was wrong. Behind her cool facade, she was struggling to cope with the knowledge that her very existence was in jeopardy. She was fighting that fear all alone, and now it has finally come to the surface. Of course she's afraid. However brilliant she may be, she's still just an 18-year-old girl. Kurisu abruptly stands up. I realize that I no longer hear the sound of rain pounding on the roof.
Kurisu: Listen, Okabe. You can't save both of us. Correct? No matter how you struggle, it's one or the other.
Rintaro: But...
Kurisu: No buts. My answer won't change. Save Mayuri.
UNSPOKEN: I hear the pain in her voice... and also the resolve. Kurisu has made up her mind. I look away and clench my fists. My nails dig into the palms of my hands.
Rintaro: Are you telling me to give up!? To abandon you!? I could never do that!
Kurisu: You can, and you must! There's no other way.
Rintaro: No! You're our friend! I won't abandon you!
Kurisu: Okabe!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu drops to her knees and grabs me by the collar. I gasp for breath as she stares into my eyes. Her eyes are hard and stern. It's always like this when she scolds me. Always the same glare...
Kurisu: Is there another solution? There isn't, is there? I don't want to live if it means sacrificing Mayuri! If you don't save her, I'll never forgive you!
Rintaro: Guh...
UNSPOKEN: This can't be happening! I hate this choice with no right answer. I hate the universe for being so cruel. And most of all, I hate myself for forcing Kurisu to speak these words when she is the one with the most to lose. Tears well up in my eyes, but I bite my lip and hold them back. Is there really no other way? I can't bear it. I look straight back at Kurisu as she holds me by the collar...
Kurisu: Eh...?
UNSPOKEN: And tightly embrace her slender body. Her clothes are still wet from the rain, but all I feel is warmth radiating from the core of her being.
Rintaro: But you're right here! Why does it have to be this way!?
Kurisu: Okabe...
UNSPOKEN: Tension drains from her back and her hands. She gives her whole body to my embrace.
Kurisu: Thank you. I know you're hurting for me. But you've done enough. I'm fine, so just think about Mayuri, okay?
