Kurisu: Wha...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu fidgets. She usually glares at me harshly, but now she's avoiding my eyes.
Rintaro: I don't ever want to forget... so let's make doubly sure.
UNSPOKEN: I decide to take the initiative. I wrap my arm gently around Kurisu's waist and pull her slender body against mine.
Kurisu: Th-then I guess there's no choice...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks up at me shyly.
Kurisu: Just a kiss... okay?
UNSPOKEN: What is she worried I'll do?
Kurisu: Be gentle... okay?
UNSPOKEN: I run my fingers softly through her hair. Then I slowly bend down...
Kurisu: Okabe... Mm...
UNSPOKEN: We're both shy, so we end up pecking at each other's lips like two small birds. Then we draw back and look at each other. Kurisu's eyes are wet. Tears are running down her cheeks. I kiss them away. They're salty.
Kurisu: Don't forget me...
UNSPOKEN: We press our lips together again. Stronger than the first time. Longer than the first time. I never want to let go. We embrace each other tightly, our feelings too powerful to contain.
Kurisu: mm...
UNSPOKEN: We seek each other's warmth again and again. Locked in our embrace, we feel each other's breath. We feel each other's scent. We feel each other's taste.
Kurisu: It's too fast...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's whisper resonates through our embrace.
Kurisu: Time is going by too fast. I could really use a word with Einstein right now. Time is not absolute. Einstein proved that time could be fast or slow, depending on the observer. Hey, Okabe. The theory of relativity is so romantic... ...and so sad, don't you think?
UNSPOKEN: How does Kurisu feel about me? In the end, she never really answered my question. Early morning, Akihabara Station. Kurisu is standing before the entrance with her huge suitcase beside her. She waves to me shyly as I approach. Then she blushes and shoots me her usual glare. After that kiss, Kurisu went back to her hotel to pack. That suitcase must hold everything that she brought to Japan. She's going back to America.
Kurisu: ...Well then.
Rintaro: Are you sure I shouldn't call Mayuri and Daru?
Kurisu: ...I think that would just make it harder. But you, I have no trouble leaving behind. ...That was a joke.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks like she's about to cry. I'm sure I look just as sad. But I won't cry. I don't have that right.
Rintaro: This is a souvenir. Take it.
UNSPOKEN: I hand her Future Gadget No. 2: The Bamboo Helicam. It's a bamboo helicopter equipped with a CCD camera, which allows it to record video in the air. A truly groundbreaking invention. But sadly, due to its constant high-speed rotation, the video it produces tends to cause motion sickness.
Kurisu: Uh... no thanks.
Rintaro: Just take it. It's not even that bulky.
UNSPOKEN: I wanted to give her Future Gadget No. 7: Ghost in the Ball, but it was too big. Kurisu accepts Bamboo Helicam with a strained smile.
Kurisu: Oh, fine. I guess I'll take it.
UNSPOKEN: And then, silence. No words of farewell. We just look at each other.
Rintaro: Sorry I couldn't go with you to Aomori...
Kurisu: Yeah... But these two weeks were fun, in their own way. Give my regards to Mayuri and Hashida, okay?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu spreads her arms wide. Without a moment's hesitation, I step forward, and embrace the girl genius one last time.
Kurisu: Hang in there, Okabe.
