Itaru: "How long is forever?"
Kurisu: "SERN’s been working on it for nine years and they still haven’t solved it."
UNSPOKEN: We’re just amateurs, so it’s bound to take even longer. ...Wait. I have an idea.
Rintaro: "Let’s look at it from a different angle. SERN tried to send people back in time, but they couldn’t get the electron feed right. The singularities were not naked. It’s the same with the PhoneWave (name subject to change). You can only send 36 bytes of data safely. Otherwise, you get a Jellyman. Let’s consider the problem in reverse. What if we could convert a human to data, then compress that data into just 36 bytes? We could send that person through the ring singularity just like a D-Mail, couldn’t we!?"
Itaru: "Convert a human to data? That’s not even possible, man. And even if it were, there’d be like exabytes of data or something! You want to compress that into 36 bytes? Are you high?"
Rintaro: "Hmm... I thought it was a good idea..."
UNSPOKEN: I guess it’s not that easy. The barriers to time travel are just too high. I turn to Kurisu, meaning to ask her opinion, and then I realize that her expression has changed dramatically. Her eyes are wide as saucers, and her mouth is hanging open.
Kurisu: "Of course... If it works, then maybe..."
UNSPOKEN: She pauses for a second, and then...
Kurisu: "Maybe we can do it!"
UNSPOKEN: Do what? Time travel? It’s hard to believe what Kurisu is saying, even though it was my idea in the first place.
Rintaro: "Are you serious?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu grins triumphantly in response.
Kurisu: "The data compression part, at least, is easy. We can just use the black holes created by the LHC, since black holes compress everything they swallow. Compression won’t harm data like it would harm a human. As long as we’re just sending data, there’s nothing to worry about."
UNSPOKEN: I get it! But wait, can we really pull off such a stunt? And besides...
Rintaro: "How do you plan to convert humans into data?"
Kurisu: "You know that my thesis got published, right?"
Rintaro: "This is no time to flaunt your accomplishments."
Kurisu: "Have you read it?"
UNSPOKEN: I haven’t.
Itaru: "I’ve got scans if you want to read it."
UNSPOKEN: Daru opens up his image folder, scrolls past tons of 2D porn, and opens up the scanned image. Sure enough, there’s Kurisu’s name in big English letters.
Kurisu: "The title of my thesis is... ’Analysis of Memory-Related Nerve Impulses in the Temporal Lobe’"
Rintaro: "...Temporal lobe? Nerve impulses?"
Itaru: "What, you didn’t know?"
Rintaro: "No, wait. This can’t be right. This title sounds like, um, neuroscience, not physics."
Kurisu: "I’m a neuroscientist. Got a problem?"
UNSPOKEN: What!? I can’t believe it. From the way she talks about particle accelerators and time travel theory, I was sure she had to be a physicist.
Rintaro: "No, forget about that. How is this related to time travel?"
