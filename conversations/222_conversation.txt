UNSPOKEN: Converting memories... to data? Kurisu proceeds to explain her thesis. Memories accumulate in something called the parahippocampal gyrus - or hippocampus - which is located in the temporal lobe of the brain. But what exactly are memories? Kurisu’s thesis analyzes that question from a neuroscientific perspective. All of the brain’s functions manifest as electrical signals running through its neurons. Even memories are written to the hippocampus by electrical signals. Kurisu analyzed how specific electrical signals correspond to specific memories. The mechanism by which humans recall memories can be likened to a word association game. You begin with a vague, abstract image, which calls successive images of increasing clarity.
Kurisu: "Imagine a chest of drawers. Each drawer is filled with tiny boxes, and inside each box is another bunch of tiny boxes. You keep opening boxes until you find the memory you’re looking for."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu discovered that the number of retrieval commands -- nerve impulses used to search up memories -- is surprisingly low. Out of hundreds of millions of nerve impulse patterns in the brain, only a few thousand are related to memory. It was the successful analysis of these patterns that earned Kurisu and her research team critical acclaim in the scientific community.
Kurisu: "Now, before you ask how this relates to time travel, there’s one more thing I need to explain. Several years ago, my lab -- the Neurophysiology Lab at Victor Condoria University -- developed a technology called Visual Rebuilding, or VR for short. Put simply, it enables conversion of video data into nerve impulse signals. Used in reverse, it can also convert nerve impulses into video data, or any other kind of electronic data. So, if we combine VR technology with my research... do you see where I’m going?"
Itaru: "...No way."
Rintaro: "We can convert memories into data?"
Kurisu: "Not just that. Memory transplantation, backups, external storage... all of those things become possible."
UNSPOKEN: It’s like science fiction... In a sense, this technology could be used to copy a person’s soul. According to Kurisu, some religious groups strongly opposed this research, as you might expect. On the other hand, the medical community is ecstatic about the possibilities. In any case, it’s amazing that my assistant here was able to make such an incredible discovery. Of course, she did have a university supporting her, but still.
Rintaro: "So basically, what you’re saying is that we convert the subject’s memories into video data... Use the LHC’s black hole to compress that data into 36 bytes... Send that data through the Kerr black hole inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change)... And finally, imprint those memories on the subject’s brain in the past."
Mayuri: "What does that mean?"
Kurisu: "We can send our memories back in time. In order to differentiate it from physical time travel, let’s call it a ’time leap’ for now. You don’t go back, just your memories. It’s so crazy that nobody’s thought of it before."
