Rintaro: ...A-Aomori it is!
UNSPOKEN: If promising to go to Aomori will let Kurisu concentrate on the time leap machine, it's a small price to pay. A small price indeed. Kurisu and Daru go home, leaving me with Mayuri. I thought she was hard at work on her costume, but when I look, I find her staring at the wall. Her hands have stopped moving.
Rintaro: Mayuri? You're not going home?
UNSPOKEN: She usually doesn't stay this late. Her parents might be worried.
Mayuri: Um, I was thinking about what Okarin and Chris-chan were talking about earlier. I was trying to figure out what the things you said meant, but it was all so complicated. I didn't get any of it. Ehehe... The only thing I get is that something amazing is gonna happen!
Rintaro: Indeed. The world is about to change, and we shall be the ones to lead humanity into the future.
Mayuri: You're shining, Okarin.
Rintaro: Shining? What does that mean?
Mayuri: You're shining. Chris-chan too. Like two bright stars in the sky.
Rintaro: That must be my aura of madness you're sensing. Muhahaha!
Mayuri: You know, it's been ten days since Chris-chan joined us. Can I tell you how I've been feeling? Since Chris-chan became a lab mem, it feels like things have really started to happen, like we're a real lab now, you know?
Rintaro: Heh. I must admit, her knowledge has been a great asset. Of course, the girl genius would never have joined us if not for the cunning of Hououin Kyouma!
Mayuri: That's why you're shining so bright now, Okarin. Chris-chan is really a big help to you, I know... But I can't do anything to help...
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri looks depressed.
Mayuri: I wish I were smart too... then maybe I could help.
Rintaro: Mayuri...
UNSPOKEN: She's never expressed such sentiments before. Is she jealous of Kurisu's talents? Is there competition brewing in the lab? I sigh and walk to the window. I can't see many stars in the sky.
Rintaro: Mayuri. Aren't you going to look at the stars?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri comes up beside me. We lean out the window together. It's only 9 PM, but Akiba is already still and silent, save for the occasional car trundling by.
Mayuri: Back when the lab just started -- before Daru-kun joined -- it was like this a lot, wasn't it? All quiet, just the two of us.
Rintaro: Yeah, it was.
UNSPOKEN: Daru joined the lab in early May. Before that, he was unwilling to join no matter how I tried to convince him. Then he learned that the lab was just three minutes away from MayQueen+NyanÂ², and suddenly he was all Future Gadget Lab, hell yeah! But for about a month and a half after the lab's founding, it was just me and Mayuri all alone.
Mayuri: Can Mayushii stay here? Is it really okay?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri looks at me with uncertainty in her eyes. I meet her gaze firmly, then bop her lightly on the head.
Rintaro: Don't be ridiculous. All you need to do is stay.
