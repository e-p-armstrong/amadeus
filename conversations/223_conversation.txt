Rintaro: Without you, the lab would be a much less friendly place. You see how Kurisu and I argue. We can be pretty stubborn, and sometimes we don't know when to stop. But when it starts to get out of hand, Mayuri, you're always there with some ditzy, irrelevant comment to break the tension.
Mayuri: Um... are you praising me?
Rintaro: Of course I am. Don't worry about a thing. Just know that you, too, are part of my plan. Muhahaha!
Mayuri: Okay. Thanks, Okarinâ™ª
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri smiles in relief. And then her stomach rumbles.
Mayuri: I'm starving! I'll warm up some canned oden. You want some too?
Rintaro: Yeah. Heat it up.
Mayuri: Coming right up!
UNSPOKEN: Soon, we are chowing down on piping hot oden. The next day, Mayuri and I go shopping at Radi-Kan. We have a list, written by Kurisu, of parts for the time leap machine. Naturally, I'm paying for everything out of my own pocket. Kurisu and Daru have already started work on the upgrade. Apparently, the conversion of memories into digital data requires software developed at Kurisu's lab in America. She can download that software from their dedicated server. But that's not the only thing we need. There's also some kind of brain-scanning headgear that we're going to have to make ourselves. Incidentally, I have to pay extra-close attention to make sure Mayuri doesn't wander off while we're shopping. If she sees some random store that interests her, she'll literally stop and stare at it for hours. I keep walking, of course, and only later realize that she's not behind me.  Then I have to run from store to store looking for her. This must be how parents of small children feel. Anyway, this is nothing new. Mayuri has always been like this.
Rintaro: I'm begging you, stick with me. If you get lost in this labyrinth of technology, you'll never escape. Not with your sense of direction.
Mayuri: Okey-dokey! I'll be careful. Um, by the way. How is time leaping different from time travel?
UNSPOKEN: Did she really hear what I just said about not wandering off? Besides, Kurisu already explained the difference yesterday.
Rintaro: Time travel means your whole body travels through time. The time leap will only send your memories to the past. It's simple.
UNSPOKEN: Just memories. No personality or consciousness included, although Kurisu did mention that there was no way to be sure what might happen to your consciousness.
Mayuri: Oh... Does that mean you can do things with time leaps that you can't do with D-Mails?
Rintaro: D-Mails can only send instructions to the past. The past may change, or it may not. The results are unpredictable, and depend on the recipient. And when the past does change, the worldline is reconfigured. Everyone loses their old memories.
UNSPOKEN: I am the exception, thanks to Reading Steiner.
Rintaro: With a time leap, on the other hand, you can give your past self not just instructions, but all of the memories you have right now... or at least, that's the idea.
