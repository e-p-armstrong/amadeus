Mayuri: Ummm, so I could send the costume I'm making back to last week? I would love to have another week to prepare for ComiMa.
Rintaro: That might be possible with time travel, but not with time leaping. Say you had a test last week. Now that you know the answers, you could send that knowledge to yourself and ace the test. But you couldn't go back and hand yourself a cheat sheet.
Mayuri: So Mayushii's mind goes into Mayushii one week ago?
Rintaro: Exactly.
UNSPOKEN: While this conversation has been going on, I've been steadily purchasing items from Kurisu's shopping list.
Mayuri: You can't bring stuff, but you can bring your memories... I get it. But, then what about Mayushii one week ago? Where do her memories go?
Rintaro: I assume they get overwritten.
UNSPOKEN: We haven't tested it, though, so there's no way to be sure.
Mayuri: She disappears?
Rintaro: Your memories right now include your memories from back then. So even if she does disappear, you don't really lose anything. I guess you could say you're just adding your memories from one week in the future.
Mayuri: Then, if Mayushii's memories leap into the Mayushii one week ago, what happens to Mayushii now?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri's asking some pretty philosophical questions today. But I guess anyone would ask the same.
Mayuri: Mayushii's memories jump to the past, but my body's still here, right? What happens to me when my memories go bye-bye?
Rintaro: You become an empty shell... no... that can't be right. That wouldn't make sense. My assistant's device merely records your memory data... in other words, it's just a backup. Your original memories are still inside you.
UNSPOKEN: Nothing inside the brain is lost. You don't become an empty shell. Besides, neither personality nor consciousness is transferred to begin with.
Rintaro: Your body shouldn't become an empty shell, and your consciousness shouldn't leap, either.
UNSPOKEN: ...No, wait. There's another issue here.
Rintaro: Actually, won't you become a new Mayuri, one who received memories from the future one week ago?
UNSPOKEN: Not that anybody, including me, would be able to tell the difference.
Mayuri: Then, does the Mayushii who had the normal memories before the time leap get erased by the Mayushii who repeated the week with extra memories?
UNSPOKEN: ...This is getting complicated.
Rintaro: That's right. She's erased. In other words, you relive the week. You can do things the same, or you could do something completely different. And you'll keep your old memories of the week that disappeared.
Mayuri: Then, does that mean...
UNSPOKEN: The questions keep coming. She's trying hard to understand in her own ditzy way.
Mayuri: So I redo the week, okay... but what if I decide to go to Ikebukuro with my friends instead of coming to the lab today? What happens to the Mayushii talking with Okarin now?
Rintaro: The present would change to match the past, and this conversation would never happen.
Mayuri: Oh... and you wouldn't notice the difference, Okarin?
Rintaro: Right. No one would notice.
Mayuri: That would be kinda sad...
