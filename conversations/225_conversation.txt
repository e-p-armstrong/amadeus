UNSPOKEN: She steps back in surprise and fear, clutching a manila envelope to her chest. This is our first meeting. I know that. But to me, she's still the girl I love.  If I'd been thinking straight a second ago, I would have realized that my plan to grab her and flee wasn't going to work. Kurisu would never follow some strange man she only just met. Running isn't an option. All I can do is wait at the scene of the crime. Fighting against the urge to stay, I force myself to turn and leave.
Kurisu: Please answer my question!
UNSPOKEN: But Kurisu pursues me. Why is she so desperate to know who I am? I do look suspicious. I'll admit that. But if she thinks I'm dangerous, why would she come alone? I turn around reluctantly and meet Kurisu's stare.
Kurisu: ...Answer me.
Rintaro: Can I--
UNSPOKEN: The words catch in my throat. Can I save her? I don't know. All I know is that convergence is merciless and cruel, and that I am powerless to stop it.
Kurisu: Can you... what?
UNSPOKEN: I shake my head, then bolt for the stairs before Kurisu can react.
Kurisu: W-wait! Stop!
