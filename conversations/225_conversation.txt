Kurisu: "Heh... you really are pompous."
Rintaro: "I assume it was your father on the phone the other day?"
UNSPOKEN: I am speaking, of course, of when I found Kurisu outside the lab, crying into her phone. The mood was... delicate.
Kurisu: "...Yeah. I don’t remember the last time he had a kind word for me. Even when we were living together, before I went to America, he acted like I wasn’t there. We’re supposed to be family, aren’t we?"
Rintaro: "And you? How did you treat your father?"
Kurisu: "I was daddy’s little girl growing up. You practically had to drag me away from him."
UNSPOKEN: She smiles, but in her smile I see a hint of self-mockery.
Kurisu: "My father’s a physicist. Even as a child, I loved to hear him talk about science. I couldn’t understand a word of it, but I always begged him to explain. I wanted to understand his work, so I started studying physics. I must have been five."
UNSPOKEN: Damn. I guess that’s what makes her a genius. Or perhaps the yearning for her father’s love was what gave birth to her genius.
Kurisu: "Thanks to that, I always got perfect grades in math. I ignored all the other subjects, though, so my grades were a little skewed. I even read my father’s papers. I was a little girl trying to comprehend theoretical physics, but I gave it everything I had. I needed to understand. By sixth grade, I had learned enough that I could discuss my father’s theories with him. I was so happy that I could talk to my father on his level, you know? We used to argue all night long. And then I started winning those arguments. All of them."
Rintaro: "Yeah. I can definitely see how that would make him hate you."
UNSPOKEN: A tragedy fitting for a girl genius. What kind of scientist loses to a grade-school girl anyway? Seriously.
Kurisu: "You really think that’s why?"
Rintaro: "I’m absolutely certain that’s why."
Kurisu: "I guess he did have a lot of pride. Anyway, one day, he suddenly stopped talking to me altogether. Then he started fighting with my mom, and finally he stopped coming home. I really loved my dad, so it was a big shock. I felt it was my fault things turned out that way. I couldn’t go to school, I was so depressed. And then Mom recommended I study abroad."
UNSPOKEN: So that’s why she went to America.
Rintaro: "You were just too talented for your own good. So, how do you feel about your father now?"
Kurisu: "I don’t know..."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks down.
Rintaro: "He’s in Japan, right? Have you seen him at all?"
Kurisu: "No... he doesn’t want to see me. That’s what we were talking about on the phone. I asked if we could meet, but he told me to stay away from him."
UNSPOKEN: Her father has quite the inferiority complex. No wonder she was crying. Even for someone as strong-willed as Kurisu, it must hurt to hear that from her father.
Kurisu: "Even if we did meet, I wouldn’t know what to say... I tried to talk to him before I left, you know? I tried so hard, but he just ignored me. It hurts. Whenever I think about going to see him, I remember those times. I worry he’ll ignore me again, and then I can’t do anything. Sniff..."
