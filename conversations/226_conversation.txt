Kurisu: "J-just a little, okay?"
Rintaro: "You want to reconcile with your father. Correct?"
Kurisu: "I don’t know..."
Rintaro: "If you didn’t, then you wouldn’t have confided in me. And you wouldn’t be crying, would you?"
Kurisu: "True..."
Rintaro: "Just be straight with him. Say ’I love you, Dad. Let’s make up.’"
Kurisu: "I think that’s a little out of character for me."
Rintaro: "It’s your father. Stop acting like a weak little girl."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu jerks upright, her face bright red.
Kurisu: "I’m not acting like a little girl!"
Rintaro: "Yes, you are. You’ll never reconcile with him like that. You need to speak from the heart, give it to him straight. It’s the only way to get your message across. You can’t sugarcoat it. If that doesn’t work, nothing will. Then you’ll just have to hope that time heals the rift between you."
Kurisu: "And how long will that take?"
Rintaro: "How should I know? I’m only a year older than you, remember? How long has it been since you went to America?"
Kurisu: "Umm... seven years."
Rintaro: "If nothing has changed in seven years, then maybe it will take twice that much time."
Kurisu: "I... guess you’re right."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu sighs heavily and rests her chin in her hand. Did my advice backfire? It looks like she’s even more depressed now. I fold my arms and wrack my brain for a solution. I don’t want to see Kurisu like this. It’s pathetic!
Rintaro: "Well? When are you going to see him?"
Kurisu: "...Huh?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu opens her eyes wide in confusion. I take out my phone and bring up the calendar.
Rintaro: "I assume it’ll be during summer break. Make sure you let me know ahead of time."
Kurisu: "Wha-wha-wha-what are you talking about!?"
Rintaro: "I might have plans. I’ll need to shift my schedule around."
Kurisu: "Hold on a second! Don’t tell me you plan on coming along!?"
Rintaro: "Of course I do. You are my assistant, and I will do whatever it takes to ensure that you are in peak mental condition for the experiment."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks dumbfounded. What? Did I say something wrong?
Kurisu: "Ok, you’ve had your fun. I’m in no mood for--"
Rintaro: "I’m being completely serious. I’ll go anywhere you want -- anywhere in Japan. I’d go anywhere in the world, but I don’t have a passport or money."
Kurisu: "Okabe..."
Rintaro: "You’re afraid you won’t know what to say, right?"
Kurisu: "Yeah..."
Rintaro: "Then that settles it. I am a master of conversation. You will have nothing to fear with Hououin Kyouma at your side!"
Kurisu: "...pfft!"
Rintaro: "Why are you laughing!?"
Kurisu: "You couldn’t hold a normal conversation if your life depended on it."
Rintaro: "Ah..."
