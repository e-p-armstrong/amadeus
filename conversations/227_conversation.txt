UNSPOKEN: Confusing how? Why is she yelling at me anyway? Shouldn’t she be thanking me instead?
Kurisu: "Um, Okabe? That offer... I can take you up on it, right?"
Rintaro: "Of course."
Kurisu: "Then, once we’re done upgrading the PhoneWave... I want you to come with me."
Rintaro: "As you wish. Where is your father, anyway?"
Kurisu: "Aomori."
Rintaro: "Aomori!?"
Kurisu: "That’s where he lives now."
UNSPOKEN: That’s way up at the north end of the island, like seven hundred kilometers or something. I wasn’t expecting to have to go that far.
Kurisu: "What? You’re not going to back out, are you? You already promised. I’m taking you whether you like it or not, okay!?"
Rintaro: "...A-Aomori it is!"
UNSPOKEN: If promising to go to Aomori will let Kurisu concentrate on the time leap machine, it’s a small price to pay. A small price indeed. Kurisu and Daru go home, leaving me with Mayuri. I thought she was hard at work on her costume, but when I look, I find her staring at the wall. Her hands have stopped moving.
Rintaro: "Mayuri? You’re not going home?"
UNSPOKEN: She usually doesn’t stay this late. Her parents might be worried.
Mayuri: "Um, I was thinking about what Okarin and Chris-chan were talking about earlier. I was trying to figure out what the things you said meant, but it was all so complicated. I didn’t get any of it. Ehehe... The only thing I get is that something amazing is gonna happen!"
Rintaro: "Indeed. The world is about to change, and we shall be the ones to lead humanity into the future."
Mayuri: "You’re shining, Okarin."
Rintaro: "Shining? What does that mean?"
Mayuri: "You’re shining. Chris-chan too. Like two bright stars in the sky."
Rintaro: "That must be my aura of madness you’re sensing. Muhahaha!"
Mayuri: "You know, it’s been ten days since Chris-chan joined us. Can I tell you how I’ve been feeling? Since Chris-chan became a lab mem, it feels like things have really started to happen, like we’re a real lab now, you know?"
Rintaro: "Heh. I must admit, her knowledge has been a great asset. Of course, the girl genius would never have joined us if not for the cunning of Hououin Kyouma!"
Mayuri: "That’s why you’re shining so bright now, Okarin. Chris-chan is really a big help to you, I know... But I can’t do anything to help..."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri looks depressed.
Mayuri: "I wish I were smart too... then maybe I could help."
Rintaro: "Mayuri..."
UNSPOKEN: She’s never expressed such sentiments before. Is she jealous of Kurisu’s talents? Is there competition brewing in the lab? I sigh and walk to the window. I can’t see many stars in the sky.
Rintaro: "Mayuri. Aren’t you going to look at the stars?"
