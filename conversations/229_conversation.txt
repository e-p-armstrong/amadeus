Mayuri: "Oh... Does that mean you can do things with time leaps that you can’t do with D-Mails?"
Rintaro: "D-Mails can only send instructions to the past. The past may change, or it may not. The results are unpredictable, and depend on the recipient. And when the past does change, the worldline is reconfigured. Everyone loses their old memories."
UNSPOKEN: I am the exception, thanks to Reading Steiner.
Rintaro: "With a time leap, on the other hand, you can give your past self not just instructions, but all of the memories you have right now... or at least, that’s the idea."
UNSPOKEN: We won’t know for sure if it works until the machine is built.
Mayuri: "Ummm, so I could send the costume I’m making back to last week? I would love to have another week to prepare for ComiMa."
Rintaro: "That might be possible with time travel, but not with time leaping. Say you had a test last week. Now that you know the answers, you could send that knowledge to yourself and ace the test. But you couldn’t go back and hand yourself a cheat sheet."
Mayuri: "So Mayushii’s mind goes into Mayushii one week ago?"
Rintaro: "Exactly."
UNSPOKEN: While this conversation has been going on, I’ve been steadily purchasing items from Kurisu’s shopping list.
Mayuri: "You can’t bring stuff, but you can bring your memories... I get it. But, then what about Mayushii one week ago? Where do her memories go?"
Rintaro: "I assume they get overwritten."
UNSPOKEN: We haven’t tested it, though, so there’s no way to be sure.
Mayuri: "She disappears?"
Rintaro: "Your memories right now include your memories from back then. So even if she does disappear, you don’t really lose anything. I guess you could say you’re just adding your memories from one week in the future."
Mayuri: "Then, if Mayushii’s memories leap into the Mayushii one week ago, what happens to Mayushii now?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri’s asking some pretty philosophical questions today. But I guess anyone would ask the same.
Mayuri: "Mayushii’s memories jump to the past, but my body’s still here, right? What happens to me when my memories go bye-bye?"
Rintaro: "You become an empty shell... no... that can’t be right. That wouldn’t make sense. My assistant’s device merely records your memory data... in other words, it’s just a backup. Your original memories are still inside you."
UNSPOKEN: Nothing inside the brain is lost. You don’t become an empty shell. Besides, neither personality nor consciousness is transferred to begin with.
Rintaro: "Your body shouldn’t become an empty shell, and your consciousness shouldn’t leap, either."
UNSPOKEN: ...No, wait. There’s another issue here.
Rintaro: "Actually, won’t you become a new Mayuri, one who received memories from the future one week ago?"
UNSPOKEN: Not that anybody, including me, would be able to tell the difference.
Mayuri: "Then, does the Mayushii who had the normal memories before the time leap get erased by the Mayushii who repeated the week with extra memories?"
