Kurisu: That's it! It's all Hashida's fault!
Rintaro: But it's cute how you try to hide it, @channeler Chris.
Kurisu: DON'T CALL ME THAT.
UNSPOKEN: She glares at me hard. If looks could kill... She has no sense of humor at all. I should be more careful in the future.
Rintaro: But I don't understand. You were raised in America, so how are you so familiar with @channel?
Kurisu: You can browse @channel from America. Need I say more?
Rintaro: Ahh, I get it. Living in an English-only environment made you hungry for Japanese. But did you have to resort to @channel?
UNSPOKEN: I mean, if you believe the pseudo-intellectuals in the media, browsing @channel is like reading scribbles on the bathroom wall. 
Kurisu: Sure, it's not the friendliest place, but I couldn't find anywhere that felt more 'Japanese'. Anyway, can I ask a favor?
Rintaro: What is it?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu turns away and mumbles something. But her voice is so low, I can't make it out.
Rintaro: If you have something to say, say it.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu turns bright red, but her sullen expression doesn't change.
Kurisu: Don't tell anyone else about this.
Rintaro: What difference does it make? Daru's the most hardcore @channeler who ever lived, and Mayuri's an otaku too. Even I browse @channel regularly. There's nothing to be ashamed of! Just boldly write 'Hobbies: Browsing @channel' on your resume!
Kurisu: Not a chance, you idiot!
Rintaro: What!? You mean you'd rather post anchors on VIP!?
Kurisu: Gh, I hate myself for understanding those words!
Rintaro: Well, whatever. If it will help you focus on the time leap machine, I'll keep your secret for now. Besides, it's just a matter of time before you make another mistake and reveal your true colors.
Kurisu: You don't have to worry about me. Remember that I represented my entire laboratory when we presented our research, even though there were men twice my age on the project. I'm an expert at dealing with people. I'll have no trouble keeping it a secret.
Rintaro: ...Nullpo.
Kurisu: Gah! No...!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's face gets even redder, and then she falls to her hands and knees in defeat. orz Just as I thought, @channel is in her blood and bones. She doesn't have a prayer. As night fell, we tried to activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change) again, but as expected, the discharge did not occur.
Mayuri: *yawn*...
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri is at her sewing machine, putting some finishing touches on a costume. She got back earlier this evening, after delivering a different costume to her friend, Fubuki-chan. She's been working on this costume ever since. Come to think of it, she usually heads home around 7 or 8, but today, she's still hard at work.
Rintaro: Mayuri, go home before it gets too late. Your parents will worry.
Mayuri: It's okay. I'm gonna stay the night.
Rintaro: ...R-really?
