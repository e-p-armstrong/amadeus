Rintaro: "That’s right. She’s erased. In other words, you relive the week. You can do things the same, or you could do something completely different. And you’ll keep your old memories of the week that disappeared."
Mayuri: "Then, does that mean..."
UNSPOKEN: The questions keep coming. She’s trying hard to understand in her own ditzy way.
Mayuri: "So I redo the week, okay... but what if I decide to go to Ikebukuro with my friends instead of coming to the lab today? What happens to the Mayushii talking with Okarin now?"
Rintaro: "The present would change to match the past, and this conversation would never happen."
Mayuri: "Oh... and you wouldn’t notice the difference, Okarin?"
Rintaro: "Right. No one would notice."
Mayuri: "That would be kinda sad..."
Rintaro: "For who? Me?"
Mayuri: "No. For Mayushii."
UNSPOKEN: I don’t get what she means.
Mayuri: "Maybe that’s why Chris-chan doesn’t want to change the past."
UNSPOKEN: She nods to herself with a bright smile.
Mayuri: "Oh! I just thought of something. Can you time leap into the future?"
Rintaro: "Maybe, but there wouldn’t be a point."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu and I reached that conclusion yesterday. The memories you send overwrite the memories at your destination. If you sent your memories one week into the future, then the future you would lose one week of memories.
Rintaro: "The whole point of our time leap machine is to affect past events. We don’t need to worry about the future. Besides, you’re less likely to reach the future than you are the past. And that’s because the future is inherently unpredictable. For example, do you think you’ll have the same phone number for all eternity?"
Mayuri: "How should I know? Ehehe."
Rintaro: "Exactly my point. And remember, pagers became obsolete with the advent of cellphones. Similarly, our phones may be replaced by some other device in the future."
