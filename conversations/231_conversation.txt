Kurisu: What? Are you planning to molest us!?
Rintaro: Shut up, Mongolian Spot!
Kurisu: I don't have a Mongolian Spot! And when did you see my butt, anyway!?
Rintaro: I can't leave two young girls here alone! Minors need guardians!
Mayuri: But Okarin's a minor too!
Rintaro: I'll be 20 in less than a year and a half. In other words, Steins Gate has decided that I am an adult.
Kurisu: I'm pretty sure that makes you a minor just like us.
Mayuri: Um, Chris-chan? I don't think Okarin would do anything bad. I mean, we've been together for more than ten years, and he hasn't molested me once.
Kurisu: But he took you hostage, didn't he?
Mayuri: Yupâ™ª Actually, I'm still his hostage.
Kurisu: We should kick him out of the room.
Rintaro: Haa...
UNSPOKEN: I sigh deeply and place a hand on my forehead.
Rintaro: You disappoint me, Christina. This lab is a place of science. We are above such petty concerns as sex. If you must speak of these vulgarities, then I'll have to ask you and your Mongolian Spot to leave!
UNSPOKEN: Looks like that was enough to convince Kurisu. She gives me a fine, fine gesture as she returns to the development room.
Rintaro: Ah. So Christina really does have a birthmark on her bu--
Kurisu: NO!
