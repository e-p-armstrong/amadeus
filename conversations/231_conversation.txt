UNSPOKEN: Mayuri’s still talking about the time leap.
Rintaro: "You want to go back to your elementary school days? Heh heh heh, I know exactly how you feel. If you repeat elementary school with the knowledge you have now, you’ll get top grades and have an easy time bending children to your will."
Mayuri: "Yeah, and I thought maybe I could see Grandma again."
Rintaro: "...I see. I’m afraid that’s not possible."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri’s grandmother passed away when Mayuri was in elementary school.
Mayuri: "Yeah... It’s too bad, but I guess I don’t really need to see her. I still remember her words, her smile, and her wrinkly hand patting my head. So even if I don’t see her again, I’m okay. What I really want is to see little Okarin again! Ehehe!"
Rintaro: "Heh. Back then, I was already a scientist without equal, a titan towering above the other children. You can hardly be blamed for desiring to meet the child prodigy who would one day be feared as the great mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma."
Mayuri: "I don’t want to meet Hououin Whatshisface. I want to meet Okarin!"
UNSPOKEN: I am Hououin Kyouma. Always have been, always will be. Mayuri just doesn’t get it. So I disregard her comment.
Rintaro: "Anyway, there’s no point. You haven’t matured at all since that time, so nothing would change if you went back to elementary school anyway."
Mayuri: "Hey! That’s not true. Mayushii’s all grown up now."
Rintaro: "The only thing that’s grown is how much you eat."
UNSPOKEN: And your breast size.
Mayuri: "That’s not true! Mayushii’s a real woman now."
UNSPOKEN: A real woman? I kind of want to hear the details, but she probably doesn’t know what she’s talking about.
Mayuri: "Besides, I think Okarin’s the one who hasn’t changed since then."
Rintaro: "Isn’t that what I said? I was already a genius mad scientist when you met me! MUHAHAHA!"
UNSPOKEN: The shopkeeper shoots me a glare. I guess this isn’t the best place for maniacal laughter. Better get those parts and head back to the lab. We finish our shopping and come out in front of the station.
Rintaro: "By the way, Mayuri. Have you not been working recently?"
Mayuri: "Working? You mean at Lemoine?"
UNSPOKEN: Of course. MayQueen+Nyan² doesn’t exist in the current wholesome Akiba.
Mayuri: "Um, ComiMa’s coming up, so I’m taking a few days off. I’ve got costumes to make!"
Rintaro: "How many costumes are you making this year?"
Mayuri: "Three. One for Kaede-chan, one for Fubuki-chan, and then there’s one for Luka-chan."
