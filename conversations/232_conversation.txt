Rintaro: "What?"
UNSPOKEN: I look where Mayuri’s pointing and see Moeka squatting by the staircase, staring hard at her cellphone. She looks more tired than the last time I saw her. There are bags under her eyes, and her hair is frayed. The intensity of her expression makes me hesitate to call out to her. She’ll probably just ignore me like before. On the other hand, she is a lab mem. I can’t just ignore her.
Rintaro: "Hey, Finger! Why the long face, eh?"
Mayuri: "Tutturu♪ Moeka-san. What are you doing here?"
UNSPOKEN: Moeka doesn’t look up. She mutters something that I can’t make out.
Rintaro: "Hey, are you listening? If you have a problem, the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, will gladly assist! But be warned. By the time I’m through, Akiba will be an ocean of blood... heh heh heh."
UNSPOKEN: Moeka suddenly jerks upright as if poked with an electric prod. She lifts her head and stares at me with wide eyes, then jumps to her feet and walks right up to me. This is the first time I’ve seen Moeka express such emotion.
Rintaro: "What is it? What’s wrong?"
UNSPOKEN: She doesn’t speak. That hasn’t changed. Instead, she looks down and starts typing on her phone. Guess I should be ready for a mail.
Rintaro: "What do you mean, what happened? We don’t fully understand it yet. We’re in the middle of upgrading it."
Mayuri: "It’s amazing! This time, we might even be able to time leap."
Rintaro: "Don’t write anything about it. Otherwise we’ll have to expel you from the lab."
UNSPOKEN: Moeka shakes her head violently. Guess she won’t write an article.
Rintaro: "Our hacking of SERN has uncovered a new possibility for the PhoneWave (name subject to change). It’s a form of time travel made possible by borrowing SERN’s equipment. This discovery will begin a new age of human civilization. No longer will men be slaves to time. Any future you desire can be yours! And history will record that we, the Future Gadget Laboratory, changed the world forever!"
Mayuri: "Um, Okarin, that was really confusing. You lost Mayushii."
UNSPOKEN: How can you not be moved by my speech? I’m talking about becoming legends here. Moeka bites her lip and types out a mail in irritation. Then she grabs my arm and digs in her fingernails. It hurts.
Rintaro: "U-unhand me!"
UNSPOKEN: But Moeka does not listen.
Rintaro: "The time leap is a way to send your memories to the past! We found a way to make that possible. Soon we will complete the machine and become the undisputed lords of time!"
Mayuri: "Um, Okarin came up with the idea and Chris-chan told us how to do it. Daru-kun’s helping, and Mayushii and Okarin are shopping♪"
