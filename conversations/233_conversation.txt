UNSPOKEN: I groan. In other words, we have to cause the electrical discharge phenomenon. There's a risk involved. A risk called Mister Braun. As we know, the discharge phenomenon causes the entire building to shake. Last time, Mister Braun threatened to raise our rent if it happened again. Kurisu and Daru look at me.
Itaru: It's up to you, Okarin.
Kurisu: Take care of it.
Rintaro: In other words, you're sending me to die.
Kurisu: Your sacrifice will allow us to complete the time leap machine.
Itaru: Besides, you're always the one who talks to the boss for us.
Rintaro: Well maybe it's time for you to put your lives on the line.
Kurisu: I can't. That girl who works there hates me.
Rintaro: ...Fine. But hear this. I will not die! Like the immortal phoenix, I will return, no matter how many times it takes!
UNSPOKEN: With that said, I head down to handle things with Mister Braun.
Mayuri: Don't die. Okay?
UNSPOKEN: As I pass through the lounge, Mayuri looks up from her costume to see me off. When I step into the store, Mister Braun, Suzuha, and the chipmunk are watching some comedy show on the massive 42-inch CRT. Watching TV at noon without a customer in sight. Looks like business as usual at the Braun Tube Workshop.
Suzuha: 'Sup, Okabe Rintaro.
UNSPOKEN: I raise my hand in response to Suzuha's greeting. The chipmunk -- Nae -- quickly hides behind her father when she sees me.
Rintaro: I see you're as busy as ever.
Tennouji: Okabe! Buy a CRT.
Rintaro: No thanks. I'm not some kind of retro TV otaku. I'd rather buy an LCD.
UNSPOKEN: I look around the store as I answer. ...Huh. I just thought of something. Like SERN's Large Hadron Collider, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) must have some kind of electron feed to keep the black hole open. SERN calls this feed the 'lifter'. We still haven't figured out what that is, nor what could be acting as a substitute lifter in our time machine. What if... What if our lifter is somewhere in this shop? Whatever it is must be in close proximity to the PhoneWave (name subject to change) -- it couldn't work otherwise -- and the Braun Tube Workshop is located directly below the lab. Could our lifter be a CRT?
Tennouji: You've been having a lotta girls over lately, haven't ya?
Rintaro: Just the usual members.
Suzuha: I was over the other day.
Tennouji: Invite me next time, huh? I wanna talk to some young girls for a change.
Nae: Daddy, that's dirty.
Tennouji: N-no it isn't! It's, uh... marketing! Yeah, I'm looking for new customers!
UNSPOKEN: Check out this scary-looking guy trying desperately to explain himself to his daughter. Hilarious.
Suzuha: What do you mean, for a change? You talk to me every day.
Rintaro: You're not young.
