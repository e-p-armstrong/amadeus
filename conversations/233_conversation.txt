Rintaro: "I can’t be sure. There are still several problems remaining. If they don’t give us too much trouble, I guess we’ll have it done in a week. On the other hand, we can’t do anything until they’re solved. Everything is the choice of Steins Gate. I have faith there exists a path to success. And once the door is opened, the chaos for which I have so longed shall at last descend upon the Earth. Trumpets will sound from the highest heaven, and the final battle, Ragnarok, will begin!"
Mayuri: "Who are you fighting, Okarin?"
Rintaro: "The Organization, of course. Their rule must end once and for all."
Mayuri: "Wow! Don’t do anything dangerous, okay?"
UNSPOKEN: Why does Mayuri insist on worrying about me?
Moeka: "Hehe..."
UNSPOKEN: Oh? Moeka’s lips curve into a smile.
Moeka: "Hehehe..."
UNSPOKEN: She rises to her feet unsteadily, then staggers off into the crowd. It’s like she’s forgotten about us completely. Mayuri and I can only watch her go. There’s an indescribable aura about her that holds us back.
Mayuri: "What do you think is wrong with Moeka-san?"
UNSPOKEN: I’ve known she was kind of strange ever since I met her, but this... Maybe she’s an escaped mental patient or something. Heh... not that her insanity can possibly compare to mine! For I desire nothing less than total and absolute chaos!
Rintaro: "Muha, muhahaha, MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"
Mayuri: "Whaaah? Now Okarin’s acting weird! Mayushii’s worried..."
UNSPOKEN: Mayushii looks scared, so I cease my maniacal laughter a few minutes earlier than planned. Afterwards, Mayuri and I go our separate ways. She apparently has to deliver a costume to her friend Fubuki. When I return to the lab with my spoils of war, something surprising -- though not too surprising, come to think of it -- catches my eye.
Kurisu: "Ah..."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu is on the computer. As soon as she notices I’ve returned, she quickly closes the window on the screen.
Kurisu: "H-hey! Think you could knock!?"
Rintaro: "This isn’t your room. Besides, I’d have to be a fool to knock. There could be assassins lying in ambush."
Kurisu: "Assassins? Here? Are you stupid?"
Rintaro: "Anyway, Christina. What were you looking at just now, hmm?"
UNSPOKEN: I already know the answer, of course. I caught a glimpse of the screen before she closed it.
Kurisu: "I was... doing research!"
UNSPOKEN: Looks like she plans to continue this charade. I drop my bags and go to the computer.
Kurisu: "S-stay back!"
UNSPOKEN: I slip past Kurisu’s blocking arms and restore the minimized window.
Kurisu: "G-got a problem?"
Rintaro: "...pfft!"
Kurisu: "Hey! What’s with that ’this is awful, rofl rofl’ laughter!?"
Rintaro: "Have no fear, Christina. Or should I call you... @channeler Chris!"
Kurisu: "Don’t call me that!"
Rintaro: "Heh heh heh, I already knew. That’s right! I realized long ago that you were an @channeler! You can’t hide it from me. You reek of @channel corruption!"
