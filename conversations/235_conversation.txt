UNSPOKEN: Mayuri is at her sewing machine, putting some finishing touches on a costume. She got back earlier this evening, after delivering a different costume to her friend, Fubuki-chan. She’s been working on this costume ever since. Come to think of it, she usually heads home around 7 or 8, but today, she’s still hard at work.
Rintaro: "Mayuri, go home before it gets too late. Your parents will worry."
Mayuri: "It’s okay. I’m gonna stay the night."
Rintaro: "...R-really?"
UNSPOKEN: She’s never done that before.
Mayuri: "Yup. I already told Mom and Dad."
Rintaro: "Are you staying to work on your costume?"
Mayuri: "It won’t be done in time for ComiMa if I don’t. Ehehe!"
Rintaro: "I’m surprised your parents let you stay."
UNSPOKEN: I’ve met her parents any number of times. They’re as ditzy as Mayuri. But still, I don’t think they’d appreciate their underage daughter staying overnight in this dirty lab.
Rintaro: "It must be my overwhelming charisma... No, wait, that makes me sound like a good person, so that can’t be it... Of course! Mayuri’s parents are so afraid of my insanity that they sent me their only daughter as a hostage!"
Kurisu: "Reported."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu calls out from the development room. She’s been tinkering with the PhoneWave (name subject to change), but I guess she was listening.
Kurisu: "What would you do if I called the cops on you?"
Rintaro: "I unleash my right arm on traitors, Christina."
Kurisu: "Yeah, yeah, chuunibyou, whatever."
Mayuri: "Um, I told Mom and Dad that Chris-chan would be here. Then they said okay."
Kurisu: "Wait, so I have to stay too?"
Mayuri: "Yup♪ Don’t you have to work on the PhoneWave?"
Kurisu: "I guess... but I don’t relish the thought of spending the night here. At least, not with a certain somebody around."
Rintaro: "Environment matters, Christina. This is a place of science and research, so you should have no trouble concentrating on your work. Trust the great Hououin Kyouma. Also, it may surprise you to learn that I have equipped this lab with a system that stimulates brain function. So if you were wondering where my incredible genius comes from, now you know! It’s because I sleep in this room every night!"
Kurisu: "This stimulation system of yours... I assume it’s been dumping toxic waste in your brain?"
Rintaro: "You sound like an environmentalist, Zombie."
Mayuri: "Ah, Mayushii knows! You’re talking about that, right?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu comes out of the development room to check what Mayuri’s pointing at.
Kurisu: "This... air freshener?"
Mayuri: "Okarin said the smell makes you smarter. He bought it at Akiba-o. When was that?"
Rintaro: "...About six months ago. It was on sale for 500 yen."
Kurisu: "I’m starting to think even you don’t believe the stuff you say. And besides, this air freshener is empty."
