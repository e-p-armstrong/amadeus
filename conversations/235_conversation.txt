Rintaro: What!?
UNSPOKEN: No. That's impossible. SERN is our enemy. If Daru's hacking is discovered, I have no doubt they will do everything in their power to destroy us. How can Kurisu be connected to SERN?
Rintaro: You're saying she's a spy?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha nods firmly.
Suzuha: The credit for inventing the time machine was hers.
UNSPOKEN: Again, Suzuha's words sound strange to my ears, but I still can't place my finger on why.
Suzuha: Don't let your guard down.
UNSPOKEN: I don't believe it. I saw Kurisu's anger when she learned what SERN had been doing. She called their actions a betrayal of scientists everywhere. How can someone with such a pure love of science be connected to SERN? But if what Suzuha says is true... Could she be the one who sent that threatening email? I suspected Moeka, but...
Nae: Kyah...
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, the ground starts to shake. Kurisu started the experiment!? But I haven't talked to Mister Braun yet!
Rintaro: Damn, it's too soon!
Tennouji: OKABE!
UNSPOKEN: Sure enough, veins on Mister Braun's forehead swell in response to the shaking.
Tennouji: How many times do I have tell you not to shake the building!? Cute girls or no, I ain't letting you off. Your rent's going up!
Rintaro: Wait, Mister Braun! This isn't our doing! It's an earthquake! My magic eye, Reading Steiner, predicted this would happen!
