Kurisu: I've been looking everywhere for you! Ever since you saved my life. I was afraid I'd never have a chance to say thank you. I'm so glad we could finally meet. Thank you. Thank you so much. And thank goodness you're alright.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks so radiant as she tries to hold back her tears. Just when I thought I had finally suppressed it, all my love for her flows out at once. I'm so happy that I want to cry too. So, to hide my embarrassment, I take out my phone and put it to my ear.
Rintaro: It's me. Why is she here? Reading Steiner didn't activate. What? Protect her!? Heh... that's a tall order, my friend. But if that is the choice of Steins Gate... then so be it. El Psy Kongroo.
UNSPOKEN: I close my phone and clear my throat. I have no idea what to say. She's still staring at me with those wide, pleading eyes. I open my mouth.
Rintaro: We meet again, Christina.
Kurisu: How many times do I have to tell you!? I'm not Christina, or your assistant or--
Rintaro: ...!?
Kurisu: Eh?
UNSPOKEN: Now I really have no idea what to say. How does this Kurisu know about that? Those were the names I used to tease Kurisu. She always got mad whenever I used them. They were our bond, our private joke. But I had yet to use them on the day we first met at Radi-Kan. So how could this worldline's Kurisu know?
Kurisu: Huh? I... why did I say that? Words just... popped into my head...
