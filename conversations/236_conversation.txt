UNSPOKEN: Crap. I can't talk my way out of this one.
Tennouji: Okabe, you bastard!
UNSPOKEN: Mister Braun clearly wants to snap my neck like a twig, but he elects to protect his greatest treasure -- the 42-inch CRT -- instead. He grabs the remote and switches it off, then grabs hold of the TV and hangs on for dear life.
Nae: Hauww...
Suzuha: Is it over?
Tennouji: Looks like it.
UNSPOKEN: Wait... it's over? I carefully step through the rubble and take the remote from the dazed Mister Braun's hand. I press the red power button. The 42-inch CRT instantly comes to life. I stare at the image on the screen... and smile.
Rintaro: Heh... heh heh heh.
Nae: ...!
Suzuha: ...What's wrong?
Rintaro: Muhaha. Muhahahaha! MUHAHAHAHAHA! I've done it! I'VE DONE IT! This is the lifter! It's so obvious! Why didn't I see it before!? Of course... this must be the work of Steins Gate! It chose this moment for a reason!
Tennouji: What the hell are you laughing about, Okabe? You're scaring my daughter! I'm raising your rent, you hear!? And you're paying for that CRT!
Rintaro: A little silence please, Mister Braun! This is a most glorious moment, for I have just been chosen as the ruler of all space and time! MUHAHAHAHAHA! Guh!
UNSPOKEN: Stars explode behind my eyes as Mister Braun drives his fist into the top of my head. The world spins. I struggle to get ahold of my shaken brain.
Rintaro: You... dare lay hands on the great...
Tennouji: Got somethin' to say?
Rintaro: Heh... heh heh... well then, Mister Braun... put it on my tab!
UNSPOKEN: With that, I fly out of the workshop. I rub my head. It hurts like hell. Damn that Mister Braun. Did he really have to crack me so hard? Maybe I should report him for assault. Thanks to his brutality, I had to make a strategic retreat. Fortunately, I did not emerge empty handed. The extra ten thousand yen a month will hurt, but in exchange, I have acquired information essential to the success of my plan.
Rintaro: All's well that ends well! Muhahaha!
Mayuri: Okarin! The building just shook. Are you okay?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri and Kurisu appear in the second story window.
Kurisu: Looks like you really are unkillable.
Rintaro: Heh heh heh. I have seen the future, Christina. In three minutes, you will be on your knees praising my greatness!
Kurisu: I don't think so.
UNSPOKEN: I run up the stairs.
Kurisu: How could you miss something so obvious?
UNSPOKEN: When I tell Kurisu about the 42-inch CRT downstairs, that is her first reaction.
Rintaro: Why are you blaming me?
Kurisu: ...I'm not blaming you. I'm just disappointed that nobody, including myself, noticed.
Itaru: We missed the forest for the trees.
Rintaro: To summarize... Just now, when the PhoneWave (name subject to change) shook the building, the 42-inch CRT was on. But when Mister Braun turned the TV off, the shaking stopped immediately.
