Kurisu: "Kyaaa! What are you doing!?"
Mayuri: "Hyah! No peeking, Okarin!"
UNSPOKEN: Through the steam, I see the wet, naked bodies of the two girls. Mayuri squats down, while Kurisu bashfully twists her body, trying desperately to hide her unmentionables. Are their faces red because of the heat? Or...
Rintaro: "Phew. You’re still alive."
UNSPOKEN: I wipe the cold sweat off my brow and sigh deeply.
Rintaro: "Don’t scare me like that. What are you guys doing packed into that tiny shower anyway?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu shoots me a deadly glare.
Kurisu: "Get out, you perv!"
Rintaro: "Whoa!"
UNSPOKEN: I dodge a bar of soap aimed at my face, then quickly flee the dressing room. Well... I suppose that was all my fault.
Mayuri: "Mayushii’s sad... I feel kinda dirty...."
Kurisu: "You’re gonna regret this! I’ll never forgive you!"
UNSPOKEN: Dammit. It was just a small misunderstanding. I mean, why the hell did they decide to take a shower -- together! -- when they knew I was coming right back? It’s like they wanted to be seen. Kurisu, especially. After all that talk about not wanting to spend the night with me around, she sure dropped her guard awfully fast. They’re just lucky it was me who walked in on them. What if it had been the Organization? They need to get serious. We’re fighting for our lives here. ...By the way, I didn’t see a Mongolian Spot on Kurisu’s butt. Naturally. Anyway, how much longer are they going to shower? Looking at the clock, it’s already been more than 15 minutes since I got back. They were yelling at me a few minutes ago, but now I hear laughter and happy squeals coming from the shower room. Sounds like they’re having a good time... They get along almost like sisters. They’re checking each other out, aren’t they!? Muhahaha! In my head, I call up the memory of what I saw in the shower. Wet hair. Beads of water glistening on their soapy skin. Round, full treasures hidden by conveniently placed steam... I put my phone to my ear.
Rintaro: "It’s me. We have a problem. I’m under attack from the Mongolian Spot and Ditzy sisters. They’re going directly after my sanity, a bold move against the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma. This is the strongest offensive I’ve encountered so far. I realize now that vulnerability itself can be a powerful weapon. They’re pulling out all the stops, and I don’t think my pants can take it. Give in to the temptation? Nonsense. I could never do that. They’re fellow lab members, my loyal assistant and my childhood friend. ...Must I? Is it truly the will of Steins Gate that I give in? That I raise my hand against my closest companions? If so... then how cruel the fates be! El... Psy... Kongroo!"
