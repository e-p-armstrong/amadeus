UNSPOKEN: Suzuha’s the same age as Daru and I, which makes her older than Mayuri or Kurisu.
Suzuha: "Did you say something, Okabe Rintaro?"
Rintaro: "Only the truth."
Tennouji: "Nae, your father is happy as long as he has you. Okay?"
Nae: "Yup. I know. But don’t say dirty things anymore, ’kay?"
Tennouji: "It’s a promise!"
UNSPOKEN: Then he joins pinkies with his daughter. Damn, Mister Braun, you’re way off character. How does a guy like him produce a daughter like that? Nae is one of the kindest, gentlest girls I’ve ever met. I don’t know why she’s so afraid of me, though. Anyway, I came here to explain that the building’s about to shake. How do I avoid having my head ripped off? How many more earthquakes do you think this building can handle? No, that’s way too obvious. An earthquake is coming! My magic eye, Reading Steiner, has seen it in the future. Escape while you still can! Yeah, that might work.
Suzuha: "Hey, did Shiina Mayuri stay over yesterday?"
Rintaro: "Yeah."
Suzuha: "So... Makise Kurisu stayed too?"
Rintaro: "Yeah. They’re both upstairs."
Suzuha: "Oh..."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha’s hostility towards Kurisu hasn’t abated.
Rintaro: "And how are you doing?"
Suzuha: "Huh?"
Rintaro: "Are you feeling better?"
Suzuha: "Oh. Yeah, I guess. The search continues."
Tennouji: "Huh? What’s this about, part-timer?"
Suzuha: "I’m searching for my dad. I told you before, remember?"
Tennouji: "Oh, right. Go find her old man, Okabe."
UNSPOKEN: Why does he think he can boss me around?
Rintaro: "Hmph, naturally. Suzuha’s a fellow lab member. Leave it to us."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha looks at me with a smile that shines through the gloom filling the store.
Suzuha: "Okabe Rintaro... we’re the same age, but sometimes you seem a lot older. You really know how to give people strength."
UNSPOKEN: That’s the first time anyone’s said that to me. It makes me kinda happy.
Rintaro: "Heh, of course. I am the great Hououin Kyouma!"
UNSPOKEN: The chipmunk cowers in terror as I unveil my madness. I can see tears pooling in her eyes. I guess my aura is just too powerful for a grade-school girl to endure.
Tennouji: "Okabe. Next time you scare Nae, I’ll kill ya."
Rintaro: "S-sorry..."
Suzuha: "Come here a sec."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha takes my arm and leads me away from the Tennoujis, who have gone back to watching TV.
Suzuha: "I just want to say... Be circumspect in your dealings with Makise Kurisu."
Rintaro: "What?"
UNSPOKEN: Circumspect? Why can’t she just say careful like a normal person? Not that I’m one to talk.
Rintaro: "This again? Aren’t you just being paranoid?"
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha shakes her head firmly.
Suzuha: "No. Her perniciousness has been proven."
