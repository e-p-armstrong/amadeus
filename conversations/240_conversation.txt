Mayuri: Fwapp!
Itaru: I got a fwapp!
Kurisu: Stop it already, perv.
UNSPOKEN: I follow Mayuri's directions and spread the costume out by the sleeves.
Mayuri: Hmm...
UNSPOKEN: She inspects it from a few paces away. It's hard to believe, given her usual ditziness. but Mayuri is very serious about her art. That's why cosplayers value her costumes so highly. The costume I'm holding now is custom-made for Lukako. I thought Lukako was against it, but I guess Mayuri managed to persuade her.
Mayuri: Okay. Thanks!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri looks tired. She's been working all night. But that doesn't dim the brightness of her satisfied smile.
Mayuri: Finishedâ™ª
Rintaro: It's done?
Mayuri: Yup. I finished before Chris-chan. We were racing.
Kurisu: You win, Mayuri. Congratulations.
UNSPOKEN: Damn you, assistant... She treats me and Daru like garbage, but Mayuri gets the sisterly touch.
Kurisu: Actually, I'm just about finished too.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu connects the two cords she's holding.
Kurisu: Done.
UNSPOKEN: Celebration is in order. ...But nobody cheers.
Mayuri: It's a tie...
Itaru: Man, I'm tired... I want Faris-tan to comfort me...
UNSPOKEN: Honestly, I don't feel like cheering either. And it's not because I'm tired. We worked around the clock for three straight days to finish the time leap machine, but now that it is complete, I realize that part of me never truly believed it would happen. I feel my enthusiasm cooling rapidly, the fire quenched by one stark question. What do we do with it? I look at Kurisu. She, too, seems less than enthused. 
Kurisu: We may have created a monster here...
UNSPOKEN: I look at the improved PhoneWave (name subject to change) again. The biggest change is the headgear attached to the X68000. It looks like something out of a low-budget cyberpunk movie. Fortunately, we don't need nerve jacks or brain chips for it to work. You just put it on and let the sensors do the rest.
Rintaro: Why don't we decide what to call it first? I vote Heavenly Express!
Itaru: PhoneWave 3rd Edition ver1. 00.
Mayuri: Silly Hat PhoneWave-chan.
UNSPOKEN: No consensus.
Kurisu: You guys have too much free time.
Rintaro: Does that mean you're abstaining from the vote?
Kurisu: ...Time Leap Machine.
Itaru: That's terrible.
Kurisu: C-come on! Simple is best, right? I mean, that's what Okabe's been calling it for the past two days.
Rintaro: Looks like my assistant has zero naming sense.
Kurisu: I don't want to hear that from a chuunibyou headcase like you.
Itaru: Oh-ho! So Makise-shi knows the word chuunibyou... I sense your otaku level is quite high.
Kurisu: I... heard it from a friend. I have no idea where it comes from!
UNSPOKEN: Hah! A baldfaced lie. She should just confess to being an @channeler. Kurisu meets my grin with an icy glare.
Rintaro: It's up to you, Mayuri. Choose one.
