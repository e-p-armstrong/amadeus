Kurisu: "The discharge was interrupted. I put a banana in just to be sure. Nothing happened."
Mayuri: "I’m glad. We shouldn’t waste food."
UNSPOKEN: Nobody replies to Mayuri’s off-point statement. We’re busy reading about cathode ray tubes on the Internet. It doesn’t take long before we find something interesting. A cathode ray tube has a component called an electron gun, which uses extreme heat and a strong electric field to accelerate electrons and turn them into a beam. The electron beam striking the TV screen’s phosphor layer is what generates the picture. An electron gun could certainly work as a lifter.
Kurisu: "We’ve found the answer. The electrons emitted by the 42-inch CRT are holding the PhoneWave’s black hole open. And the discharge phenomenon is the result."
Itaru: "So the reason we can’t use the PhoneWave at night is because the Braun Tube Workshop’s closed?"
UNSPOKEN: The Braun Tube Workshop doesn’t have especially strict business hours, but it’s usually open from around 11 AM to 7 PM. That matches up perfectly with my observation that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) only works between noon and 6 PM. The few instances it hasn’t worked during that timeframe can be explained by the TV being off.
Rintaro: "But how can a cathode ray tube emit such a strong electron stream?"
Kurisu: "It’s not about having a strong electron stream. If stronger were better, SERN would’ve solved the lifter problem long ago."
UNSPOKEN: I see. So it can’t be too strong or too weak. By freak coincidence, the 42-inch CRT’s electron gun appears to have exactly the right level of electron discharge. That’s the only explanation.
Kurisu: "Somehow, the conditions here were perfect to create a time machine. Frankly, it’s a miracle."
Rintaro: "No, Christina! Not a miracle! This is the choice of Steins Gate!"
UNSPOKEN: Rather than glare at me as she has so many times in the past, Kurisu shoots me an exasperated smile.
Kurisu: "Whatever it is, it worked."
Mayuri: "Umm..."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri looks up from her costume with a question in her eyes.
Mayuri: "So, um, what do we have to do to complete Super PhoneWave-chan?"
Kurisu: "Now that we’ve found the cause, there’s nothing left to hold us back. We can safely conclude that time leaping is possible when, and only when, that television is on."
Itaru: "We should probably test it, right? And there’s still the final check of the PhoneWave to do."
Kurisu: "You’re right. Okabe."
Rintaro: "What?"
Kurisu: "Go downstairs and turn that TV back on."
Rintaro: "Ha. Ha. Ha. That’s hilarious, Christina. Allow me to dub that... Mission: Impossible!"
UNSPOKEN: I’m not going back down there. My head still hurts from last time! Next time, I doubt I’ll make it out alive.
Kurisu: "Whatever. Just go already."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu orders me with a sour look. It’s like I’m the assistant here.
Kurisu: "If anyone can do it, it’s you. You made an amazing discovery just now, didn’t you?"
