UNSPOKEN: This isn't like the time-leaping you see in sci-fi novels. We aren't yet capable of transferring personality and consciousness.
Kurisu: Ahem. Um, since you need a phone to receive the signal, you can only send memories to the times you had one. We also need to make sure that the sender and recipient are the same person. If someone besides your past self -- your parents, or a friend, for instance -- answers the phone, then the nerve impulse signals will be projected into their brain instead. If that happens, your memories could overwrite theirs, which could obviously cause serious damage to their psyche.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu ends her explanation and takes a short breath. The lab falls into silence. I exchange glances with Kurisu and Daru. I look at Mayuri, but her expression is blank. I guess it was too complicated for her.
Rintaro: So.
UNSPOKEN: I clear my throat. It's time for the million dollar question.
Rintaro: What do we do with it?
Itaru: Do with what?
Rintaro: The Time Leap Machine, of course. What do we do with it?
UNSPOKEN: For once, my assistant has nothing to say. I already know that she fears we've created a monster. Honestly, I feel the same way. After a few moments, Kurisu finally speaks.
Kurisu: It's too much for us to handle, that's for sure. The safest thing would be to hand it over to the government for professional research.
UNSPOKEN: I can tell that she's not pleased to have reached this conclusion. She obviously would prefer to experiment with this technology. After all, it's humanity's first time machine. We've finally taken our first steps towards godhood. I'm sure that the nations of the world would pay billions for just one look at our machine. The possibilities that it represents are limitless.
Itaru: It just doesn't feel real.
Mayuri: Mayushii doesn't get it...
Itaru: That's 'cause you didn't work on it, Mayu-shi.
Mayuri: Oh, right. Ehehe!
Kurisu: What about you, Okabe? And I mean you, not Hououin Kyouma.
UNSPOKEN: I agree with Kurisu that the Time Leap Machine is dangerous. On the other hand...
Rintaro: I want to experiment.
UNSPOKEN: I state my honest feelings. Kurisu gasps.
Rintaro: But there are still questions we need to answer.
UNSPOKEN: This is unknown territory -- not just for us, but for all of humanity.
Rintaro: ...Who will time leap?
UNSPOKEN: I look to each of the lab mems in turn. Daru quickly looks away. Mayuri's expression is blank. Kurisu... stares right back at me.
Kurisu: ...It's hard to choose.
Itaru: I'll pass.
Mayuri: ...?
UNSPOKEN: Not a single person here wants the honor of being history's first time traveler. Everyone -- except for Mayuri -- is probably thinking about what could go wrong. What if the time leap were to fail?
Kurisu: It's not like SERN's time machine. The possibility of becoming a jellyman is zero. This machine sends data, not the real thing. Don't let your preconceptions influence your decision. You might say it's like a cut-and-paste of your brain. Actually, it's more like a copy-paste. And it's just your memories. The original doesn't get erased.
