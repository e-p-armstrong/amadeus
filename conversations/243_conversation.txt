Kurisu: "No."
Rintaro: "Ah."
Itaru: "Damn. That was harsh."
Kurisu: "Oh, whoops. I was supposed to flatter him so he’d feel like going, right? Yes, you’re an amazing mad scientist."
Rintaro: "It’s too late!"
Kurisu: "Anyway, now that we’ve found the lifter, the time leap machine is 99% complete."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu’s expression suddenly turns serious, but I can see the hunger in her eyes and the flush of excitement on her cheeks. She knows that we stand on the threshold of a new age in science, and she cannot resist the lure of the unknown. She’s a true scientist. No doubt about it.
Kurisu: "It’s your dream, isn’t it? To invent a time machine."
UNSPOKEN: Our dream... I’ve never really thought about it that way. But she’s right. My hands are shaking. Not from fear of Mister Braun, but from excitement.
Rintaro: "I will become the undisputed lord of time. With that power, I will shatter the System and Chaos will rule the--"
Kurisu: "Okabe."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu interrupts my speech.
Kurisu: "I wasn’t asking Hououin Kyouma. I was asking Okabe."
UNSPOKEN: She spears me with her gaze. I meet it head on. After a few moments, I feel my mouth curve into a smile.
Rintaro: "I’ll do it. Leave it to me."
UNSPOKEN: With that, I head downstairs. A cracked skull and an empty wallet are a small price to pay for science. Kurisu and Daru send me off with applause for some reason. Mayuri’s the only one who looks worried, but I pat her head in reassurance. When I get downstairs, Suzuha and the chipmunk are sitting side by side on the bench outside.
Suzuha: "’Sup."
UNSPOKEN: Nae gives me a quick bow, then hides behind Suzuha.
Suzuha: "That shaking upstairs put the boss in a bad mood. Nae and I are waiting it out."
UNSPOKEN: Damn. Now I really don’t want to go in there.
Nae: "Um... are you okay? Dad hit you pretty hard..."
Rintaro: "I’ll have you know that my brain is more valuable than the Mona Lisa! Your father may have set humanity back a hundred years by wiping out my brain cells."
Suzuha: "Such a regrettable loss."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha clasps her hands in solemn prayer. Uh, I’m not dead. Just my brain cells.
Nae: "I’m sorry... Daddy did something bad..."
Rintaro: "Chipmunk... what a gentle heart you have!"
UNSPOKEN: I can’t believe she’s Mister Braun’s daughter.
Rintaro: "I suppose I share some of the blame. Your father and I are even."
UNSPOKEN: Nae smiles slightly at my words of comfort.
Rintaro: "Now then, Part-Time Warrior. I have a request of you. I need you to distract Mister Braun for about five seconds."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha’s eyes start to shine.
Suzuha: "You mean seduce him?"
UNSPOKEN: She flexes her bicep for some reason.
Suzuha: "Go on, touch it."
