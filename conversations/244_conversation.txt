Suzuha: "I’m not much of a warrior if I can’t handle that. Besides, you said you’d help me search for my father, right? I’m only returning the favor."
Rintaro: "I see. Then I leave it in your capable hands."
Suzuha: "Okey-dokey!"
Nae: "Suzuha? Don’t be mean to Daddy, okay?"
Suzuha: "Ahaha! Don’t worry. I won’t be mean."
Rintaro: "Indeed."
UNSPOKEN: I want to complain that he’s the one being mean, but I just said we were even, so I refrain.
Suzuha: "Wait here, Nae."
UNSPOKEN: The chipmunk nods. When we enter the store, we find Mister Braun cleaning up the pieces of the broken CRT. When our eyes meet, another vein pops on his forehead.
Tennouji: "If you came to apologize, I’ll listen. But your rent’s going up, understand?"
Rintaro: "I’m sorry about what happened. I overreacted. As a token of apology, my lab’s representative, Amane Suzuha, would like to present you with a gift."
Suzuha: "Boss... get ready!"
UNSPOKEN: With a vigorous shout, which in no way seems appropriate for seduction, Suzuha whips off her jacket and--
Suzuha: "Yaah!"
UNSPOKEN: Throws it into Mister Braun’s face.
Tennouji: "Mwoah!?"
UNSPOKEN: I can see her bra! No, wait! That’s not a bra, but a tight tank top that leaves her midriff bare. Yet Suzuha shows no sign of embarrassment as she rushes Mister Braun.  She slips behind him, grabs her coat, and pulls it tight against his face.
Suzuha: "Okabe Rintaro, now’s your chance!"
UNSPOKEN: Now wait just a second. Is this your idea of seduction? It looks like you’re trying to suffocate him!
Suzuha: "Hurry!"
UNSPOKEN: Mister Braun flails his arms, trying to escape Suzuha’s restraint. There’s a huge difference in strength between the two. It’s only a matter of time before he shakes Suzuha off.
Rintaro: "W-well done, Warrior! Your heroism will be remembered!"
UNSPOKEN: Realizing that the only choice is to go for it, I dash to the counter, grab the remote, and switch on the 42-inch CRT. After about two seconds, an image appears on the giant screen. At the same time, the ceiling starts shaking. Kurisu activated the PhoneWave (name subject to change) with perfect timing.
Tennouji: "Mmm, mmmmmhmh! Mhmhmhmhmhhmh![linebreak]MhmhhmhmhmmhmhmhhhhmmhmhmHmhm!"
Suzuha: "It’s shaking again, Okabe Rintaro. What’s going on?"
UNSPOKEN: Did she really take off her clothes without knowing why?
Rintaro: "You’re a lifesaver, Part-Time Warrior! If you can, keep him restrained for ten more seconds!"
