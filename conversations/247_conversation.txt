UNSPOKEN: I open the pizza boxes to find the exact same ones he got for Suzuha's party.
Itaru: Because I like it.
UNSPOKEN: Naturally, I'm not amused.
Mayuri: Okarin, Okarin. I called Feris-chan and Luka-chan, but they said they couldn't come.
Rintaro: Oh. Do they have plans?
Mayuri: Feris-chan has a RaiNet tournament.
Itaru: Crap, I should've gone to cheer! How careless of me!
Mayuri: And Luka-chan seemed embarrassed for some reason.
Kurisu: Maybe she thinks you'll make her wear a costume again.
Rintaro: You still haven't convinced her to cosplay?
UNSPOKEN: Then what was the point of completing the costume?
Mayuri: She said it was embarrassing. I keep telling her 'Cuteness is Justice', but she never listens.
Kurisu: 'Cuteness is Justice'... is that what they say?
Mayuri: You're cute too, Chris-chan!
Kurisu: Hah? Eh?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu doesn't know how to react. She blushes, and Mayuri starts teasing her like a drunk old man. There's no alcohol at this party, of course.
Mayuri: Hey, ComiMa's coming up. Wanna go? I can't make something new, but I have a costume of Post-Awakening Seira from Blood Tune I made last year. I think the size is just right for Chris-chan too.
Kurisu: Me, cosplay?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks conflicted. Then she murmurs--
Kurisu: I'm sorta interested.
UNSPOKEN: She sure could have fooled us before, pretending to have no interest in otaku culture.
Kurisu: But I refuse to do it in public, though.
Mayuri: You don't have to show anyone, but eventually, you'll want them to see. The cosplay demon compels you!
UNSPOKEN: The... cosplay demon?
Mayuri: That reminds me. Chris-chan, you're always wearing that cute uniform. What school is it from?
Kurisu: Oh, this?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu lifts up her necktie.
Kurisu: I attended Ayamein for about two weeks. I modeled this outfit after their uniform.
Mayuri: Oh! Their uniform is really cute, but you made it even cuter! You might have really good design sense♪ I'll bring the costume tomorrow, okay? Will you try it on then?
Kurisu: Sure.
UNSPOKEN: Looks like Kurisu approves of the Cuteness is Justice philosophy.
Itaru: When's the photo shoot?
Kurisu: Good to know you're still a pervert, Hashida.
Itaru: Come on, it's Blood Tune's Seira! She's got 'panmoro' going on!
Kurisu: Panmoro?
Itaru: It means her panties are completely exposed!
Kurisu: N-no way...
Mayuri: It's okay♪ You might not know this, but last year, there was a really popular saying. 'They're not panties, so it's not embarrassing!'
Kurisu: It's plenty embarrassing, trust me!
Mayuri: Wear it, okay? It's a promise!
Suzuha: Maybe you shouldn't bother.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha speaks, her tone sharp. She's scowling at Kurisu again. Suddenly, the atmosphere in the room changes.
Suzuha: You're asking for trouble by trusting Makise Kurisu.
