Kurisu: "Wait. You guys are misunderstanding something. One hour isn’t enough time for your personality to change. You should be the same person one hour ago that you are now. The only difference is that you’ll have an extra hour’s worth of memories."
Rintaro: "How can you be sure?"
Kurisu: "...Well, I can’t. Nobody’s tried it before."
UNSPOKEN: This discussion’s going nowhere. Personality and consciousness can’t be strictly defined, so it’s hard to imagine what might happen.
Mayuri: "So, which is it?"
Kurisu: "We don’t know. We can argue the theories all we want, but in the end, we can only guess. This experiment may end up shattering preconceptions scientists and philosophers have held for centuries."
UNSPOKEN: We won’t know until we try. That pretty much sums it up. To make matters worse, the subject must be prepared to risk damage to their psyche. Kurisu, Daru, and I say no more. We can’t solve this problem. This is our limit as scientists. But haven’t we accomplished enough already? The Time Leap Machine itself is worthy of a Nobel Prize. We could sell this technology for billions, if we so chose. And if we go public with the Time Leap Machine, we can break SERN’s monopoly on time travel technology. That’s enough. It has to be.
Mayuri: "Hey..."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri, who has been observing the discussion with glassy eyes, opens her mouth to speak.
Mayuri: "Um, I have an idea... Why don’t we make a banana time leap instead?"
Kurisu: "Oh Mayuri... Bananas don’t have brains like people do."
Mayuri: "Oh... you need a brain, huh..."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri never changes. The atmosphere in the room gets a little more relaxed.
Rintaro: "Let’s not experiment. We’ll entrust the Time Leap Machine to a suitable research institution. Then we’ll announce it to the world."
UNSPOKEN: Thanks to the lightening of the mood, I can finally say what was on my mind. Neither Kurisu nor Daru objects. No one has touched the Time Leap Machine since that discussion. Ridiculous as it sounds, I can’t shake the feeling that it might suck my memories out and fling them into the past. Oh, the machine does have its appeal, of course. We’re all tempted by the idea of becoming humanity’s first time leapers. Yet the fear of what could happen won out in the end. Perhaps as a way to forget our fears and move on, we decide to hold a celebration to mark the completion of the device. Everyone feels the need to let loose after working so hard on the project. I have Daru order pizza while Kurisu and I go shopping for snacks. Akiba has always had a lack of supermarkets. That hasn’t changed even with the anime stores gone. After we finish shopping, Kurisu and I walk along the evening streets. She looks like she’s got something to say. She keeps stealing glances at me.
Rintaro: "Are you upset?"
Kurisu: "Upset?"
