Kurisu: "No, I’m not upset. ’Humans are temporal beings.’ That’s a Heidegger quote. I was actually relieved when you made the decision not to use the machine. If you hadn’t been there, I might not have been able to stop myself. Thank you."
UNSPOKEN: What’s this? Gratitude? Does she have a fever? I put my hand to her forehead to check. Kurisu twitches.
Kurisu: "Uh, what are you doing?"
Rintaro: "You’re talking like an assistant for a change. I thought you might have a fever."
UNSPOKEN: I drop my hand.
Kurisu: "I’m not grateful to you or anything, okay!?"
UNSPOKEN: Her voice is louder than it should be, and several people glance at us. Kurisu blushes and hangs her head. If Daru were here, he’d probably get all excited and say, A real tsundere, sweet!
Kurisu: "Anyway."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu clears her throat and returns to her usual sour expression.
Kurisu: "That ’thank you’ was just a formality. Don’t get me wrong, okay?"
Rintaro: "Of course. I only did what I had to. I am the founder of the Future Gadget Lab, Hououin Kyouma. My first priority is to protect the welfare of my lab mems. So I have no need for your thanks."
Kurisu: "And yet you always talk about plunging the world into chaos."
Rintaro: "You are my allies, and the world is my enemy."
Kurisu: "I’m speechless. You’re too self-righteous."
Rintaro: "You say ’speechless,’ yet you’re speaking?"
Kurisu: "Don’t argue semantics."
UNSPOKEN: It’s quite mysterious, really... It’s only been two weeks since Kurisu and I met. And yet it already feels natural for us to be walking together, exchanging banter like this. Perhaps pooling our efforts to create something new -- dangerous though it may be -- has brought us closer together. I admit that her knowledge and skills are impressive. I’d like her to remain at the lab if at all possible, but she said she’s going back to America this month. It’s already the 13th, so I wonder when she plans to return. I decide to ask her.
Kurisu: "Oh yeah, I forgot to get a plane ticket. I got too caught up in improving the PhoneWave."
Rintaro: "Going public with the Time Leap Machine will send the world into an uproar. We also plan to expose SERN, remember? You may not be able to go back to America for some time."
Kurisu: "I guess you’re right. I should call Mama and let her know."
UNSPOKEN: Looks like things are going to get busy. Naturally, I want Kurisu to stay with us to the end. A little bit after we return to the lab, Mayuri gets back. 
Mayuri: "Tutturu♪ I’m back!"
