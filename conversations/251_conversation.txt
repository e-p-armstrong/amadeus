Rintaro: I'm n-not going anywhere until you answer.
Moeka: You can't refuse. You have nowhere to run. We have men stationed throughout Akihabara.
UNSPOKEN: Wait... Something clicks in my head. It was them. They sent the bomb threat. They stopped the trains. Why? To keep us here? Just for that?
Moeka: I don't want to hurt anyone. The three of you, come with us.
Kurisu: Why...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu, who has kept silent until now, finally opens her mouth.
Kurisu: Why just the three of us?
UNSPOKEN: That's when I realize that Mayuri wasn't included in Moeka's demand. She only wants Kurisu, Daru, and me.
Moeka: I'm not answering your questions. Come with us. It's your only choice.
UNSPOKEN: We're not getting anywhere.
Itaru: O-Okarin...
UNSPOKEN: Daru's voice is shaking. I turn my head to look at him. He's deathly pale.
Itaru: D-don't you think we should do what she says?
Rintaro: But unless she tells me the reason...
UNSPOKEN: Honestly, I have no idea what to do. My heart is still fluttering in my chest. This seems more like a dream than reality. I'm not a military otaku. I've never seen a real gun. The black shine of their weapons looks somehow tacky. They lack the imposing feel you expect. I'd believe her if she told me they were fake. Mayuri suddenly speaks up.
Mayuri: M-Moeka-san, you're a lab mem too... aren't you?
UNSPOKEN: It's as if Mayuri asked my question for me. Moeka was a strange woman, but I welcomed her as a lab mem all the same. What is she thinking right now? In answer... Moeka pulls a gun from her belt and points it at us. I realize that Moeka isn't holding her phone. This is the first time I've seen her without it. Not like that matters now. Moeka's gun hand is trembling. Is the situation affecting her too? It must be. She's terrified of talking to people.
Moeka: Our mission... Is to silence you.
UNSPOKEN: Silence us?
Moeka: Your refusal to come will change nothing.
UNSPOKEN: Does that mean she plans to kill us? Why? What did we do?
Rintaro: Who sent you? Who are you people!?
