UNSPOKEN: The Braun Tube Workshop’s closed. Suzuha made sure the 42-inch CRT was turned off, so there’s no need to fear any malfunction from the Time Leap Machine. A heavy sigh escapes my throat. I realize that I’ve been tense and nervous since the Time Leap Machine was completed. Now I can finally relax. The topic of the Time Leap Machine has become taboo. Even Kurisu doesn’t bring it up during the meeting.
Rintaro: "Daru, why did you order the exact same pizza as before!?"
UNSPOKEN: I open the pizza boxes to find the exact same ones he got for Suzuha’s party.
Itaru: "Because I like it."
UNSPOKEN: Naturally, I’m not amused.
Mayuri: "Okarin, Okarin. I called Feris-chan and Luka-chan, but they said they couldn’t come."
Rintaro: "Oh. Do they have plans?"
Mayuri: "Feris-chan has a RaiNet tournament."
Itaru: "Crap, I should’ve gone to cheer! How careless of me!"
Mayuri: "And Luka-chan seemed embarrassed for some reason."
Kurisu: "Maybe she thinks you’ll make her wear a costume again."
Rintaro: "You still haven’t convinced her to cosplay?"
UNSPOKEN: Then what was the point of completing the costume?
Mayuri: "She said it was embarrassing. I keep telling her ’Cuteness is Justice’, but she never listens."
Kurisu: "’Cuteness is Justice’... is that what they say?"
Mayuri: "You’re cute too, Chris-chan!"
Kurisu: "Hah? Eh?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu doesn’t know how to react. She blushes, and Mayuri starts teasing her like a drunk old man. There’s no alcohol at this party, of course.
Mayuri: "Hey, ComiMa’s coming up. Wanna go? I can’t make something new, but I have a costume of Post-Awakening Seira from Blood Tune I made last year. I think the size is just right for Chris-chan too."
Kurisu: "Me, cosplay?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks conflicted. Then she murmurs--
Kurisu: "I’m sorta interested."
UNSPOKEN: She sure could have fooled us before, pretending to have no interest in otaku culture.
Kurisu: "But I refuse to do it in public, though."
Mayuri: "You don’t have to show anyone, but eventually, you’ll want them to see. The cosplay demon compels you!"
UNSPOKEN: The... cosplay demon?
Mayuri: "That reminds me. Chris-chan, you’re always wearing that cute uniform. What school is it from?"
Kurisu: "Oh, this?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu lifts up her necktie.
Kurisu: "I attended Ayamein for about two weeks. I modeled this outfit after their uniform."
Mayuri: "Oh! Their uniform is really cute, but you made it even cuter! You might have really good design sense♪ I’ll bring the costume tomorrow, okay? Will you try it on then?"
Kurisu: "Sure."
UNSPOKEN: Looks like Kurisu approves of the Cuteness is Justice philosophy.
Itaru: "When’s the photo shoot?"
Kurisu: "Good to know you’re still a pervert, Hashida."
Itaru: "Come on, it’s Blood Tune’s Seira! She’s got ’panmoro’ going on!"
