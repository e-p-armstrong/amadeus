UNSPOKEN: Moeka raises her voice in frustration.
Moeka: If you continue to resist, I'll have to resort to extreme measures.
UNSPOKEN: Moeka slowly raises her gun. She points the muzzle at... Mayuri. My whole body instantly goes cold.
Moeka: Shiina Mayuri is not needed.
Rintaro: Stop!
UNSPOKEN: I lunge at Moeka, but the dark-skinned man is faster.
Rintaro: Gah!
UNSPOKEN: Something strikes my chin with crushing force. The shock numbs my entire body. Stars explode behind my eyes. I fall to my knees, powerless to stand. Everything goes dark. What happened? Did he hit me with the butt of his rifle?
Mayuri: Okarin!
UNSPOKEN: I look up. Mayuri, face streaked with tears, is reaching out to me as if begging for help. Over her shoulder, I see Moeka ready her gun.
Kurisu: Mayuri! No!
UNSPOKEN: I try to yell Stop! but my voice catches in my throat. Nothing comes out but a pitiful wheeze. Someone. Anyone. Please. Stop her. Stop Moeka! Moeka's lips move. She's mumbling something.
Moeka: For SERN... for FB... for SERN... for FB...
UNSPOKEN: Her mouth opens and closes robotically. My blood curdles.  No! A sharp, dry crack splits the air. Time slows to a crawl. Moeka pulled the trigger. Blood spurts from Mayuri's forehead. It splashes across my face, wet and warm. Her delicate, frail body falls towards me. I catch her. Her body is limp, like a puppet with no strings. Her head and arms dangle lifelessly. The smell of gunpowder fills my nose. And then, the smell of blood.
Itaru: Wahhhhhhhhhhh!
UNSPOKEN: Daru clutches his head and falls to his knees, screaming at the top of his lungs. The sound jerks me back to my senses. In my arms, Mayuri takes one short, shallow breath. And then...
Mayuri: O...kari...
Rintaro: ...Mayuri?
Kurisu: No... no!
