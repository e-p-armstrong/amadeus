UNSPOKEN: Red flames consume my mind, an inferno of rage and hate and rage and hate and the burning desire to kill everything I see. I gently lay the motionless Mayuri on the floor. I stand up. And then I fling myself at Moeka.
Kurisu: Okabe!
UNSPOKEN: But before I can take a step, someone grabs my hand from behind.
Kurisu: You can't!
Rintaro: Let me go! Let me go!
Kurisu: You can't! They'll kill you!
UNSPOKEN: Moeka's gun is aimed at my head. Her finger is already on the trigger.
Rintaro: You gonna kill me too!?
Moeka: If you resist.
Kurisu: Please, Okabe, do what she says. Okay? Otherwise, they'll kill you too.
UNSPOKEN: I tear my hand from Kurisu's grip. My vision is a tunnel with Moeka on the other side. She won't get away with this. She killed Mayuri in cold blood. I'll do the same to her!
Kurisu: No!
