UNSPOKEN: Red flames consume my mind, an inferno of rage and hate and rage and hate and the burning desire to kill everything I see. I gently lay the motionless Mayuri on the floor. I stand up. And then I fling myself at Moeka.
Kurisu: Okabe!
UNSPOKEN: But before I can take a step, someone grabs my hand from behind.
Kurisu: You can't!
Rintaro: Let me go! Let me go!
Kurisu: You can't! They'll kill you!
UNSPOKEN: Moeka's gun is aimed at my head. Her finger is already on the trigger.
Rintaro: You gonna kill me too!?
Moeka: If you resist.
Kurisu: Please, Okabe, do what she says. Okay? Otherwise, they'll kill you too.
UNSPOKEN: I tear my hand from Kurisu's grip. My vision is a tunnel with Moeka on the other side. She won't get away with this. She killed Mayuri in cold blood. I'll do the same to her!
Kurisu: No!
UNSPOKEN: Moeka pulls the trigger.
Moeka: ...!?
UNSPOKEN: The sound of the shot smites upon my eardrums. I feel a sharp pain on the side of my head. I nearly lose my balance again. But I'm still alive. What happened? I realize that Moeka's gun is lying at her feet. Beside it is a small stone. Someone must have thrown it and knocked her gun aside.
Suzuha: Get down!
Attacker B: Gweh!!
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Suzuha is there in the doorway, knocking one man down in the blink of an eye. Before anyone can react, she darts into another man's range and delivers a piercing elbow strike to his solar plexus. The man drops to his knees, gasping for air. The remaining men turn their guns on her, but she throws the incapacitated man towards them to block their aim. She then slides into the feet of the man at the rear, tripping him forward, and in a single smooth, flowing motion, drives her knee into the man's face as he falls.
Attacker A: Who the hell!?
UNSPOKEN: The dark-skinned man aims his rifle. But before he can fire, Suzuha snatches a stunned attacker's gun and shoots him.
Attacker A: Gwah!!
UNSPOKEN: Blood spurts from the man's hand. Without pausing, Suzuha leaps into the air and delivers a soaring roundhouse kick to his jaw.
Moeka: Enough.
Suzuha: !!
UNSPOKEN: The next thing I know, the five men are down, and Moeka's gun is aimed at Suzuha's face. But Suzuha doesn't back down. Her gun is trained on Moeka's neck. It's a standoff. Neither moves. Silence returns to the room.
Moeka: Who are you?
Suzuha: 42.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha's reply makes no sense. She glances at me.
Suzuha: TV.
UNSPOKEN: What is she saying?
Suzuha: Turned on.
Moeka: What...
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Kurisu springs up and makes a break for the development room.
Moeka: Don't move!
Suzuha: That's my line!
