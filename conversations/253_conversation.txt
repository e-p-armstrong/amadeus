Suzuha: "Perhaps. But I know your true nature."
Kurisu: "Wow, you can see into my heart? That’s groundbreaking technology. I’d love to hear how it works."
Suzuha: "It’s not science. It’s... a prediction."
Kurisu: "So you’re just making it up."
Suzuha: "I know."
UNSPOKEN: Uh-oh, we’ve got a situation here.
Mayuri: "Okarin."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri clings to me with teary eyes.
Mayuri: "Stop them from fighting."
Rintaro: "Heh... this looks like a job for the one and only Hououin Kyouma."
UNSPOKEN: I insert myself between the two girls.
Rintaro: "Break it up, you two! I, Hououin Kyouma, shall decide this dispute!"
UNSPOKEN: They both glare at me. Although I’m afraid for my life, I harden my resolve. The mission must succeed. First, I focus on Kurisu.
Rintaro: "Assistant! I didn’t raise you this way."
Kurisu: "You didn’t raise me at all."
Rintaro: "If you want to become a true mad scientist, you must learn to keep your emotions in check even as you cackle your way to victory!"
Kurisu: "Nobody asked you. And I’m already a scientist."
UNSPOKEN: Next, I switch focus to Suzuha.
Rintaro: "Warrior! Your enemy is SERN, remember? You must conserve your strength for Ragnarok."
Suzuha: "I warned you before, Okabe Rintaro. Makise Kurisu is a threat."
Rintaro: "Wha--"
UNSPOKEN: You’re going to mention that here? Now?
Kurisu: "Oh? What’s this about, Okabe?"
UNSPOKEN: Their eyes are like laser beams boring into my skull. I want nothing more than to flee for my life. But Mayuri’s watching me anxiously. I need to defuse the situation.
Rintaro: "MUHAHAHA! Looks like neither of you is willing to back down. So be it! Fight to your hearts’ content! Fight until there is no more fight to be had! Then, share a manly handshake by the river and let friendship blossom! But in the future, when it comes time for you to venture out into the real world, I hope you remember one thing... Nobody likes a mood-killer!"
Kurisu & Suzuha: "Shut up!"
UNSPOKEN: Getting yelled at by both of them at the same time sends shivers down my spine. It’s coming. I quickly seize my right arm.
Rintaro: "Gah! Why now, of all times!? Calm down, right arm of mine!"
UNSPOKEN: I turn around and head back to Mayuri.
Rintaro: "I’m sorry, Mayuri. At his rate, I’ll end up hurting those two. I have no choice... the rest is up to you..."
Mayuri: "Geez..."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri puffs her cheeks out and goes over to the two girls.
Mayuri: "Um, guys? Mayushii doesn’t like it when you fight. Let’s all get along, okay?"
