Rintaro: "Hm?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri slowly looks around the lab, smiling all the while.
Mayuri: "It’s been really lively here these past few weeks, huh?"
Rintaro: "Yeah, I guess it has."
UNSPOKEN: I established the Future Gadget Laboratory around the time I entered college. It was the first step in my plan to bring chaos to the world. That was around the middle of March this year, which means it’s been almost five months. Not half a month after it was established, Mayuri showed up -- I’m still not sure why -- and became a lab mem. For about a month, it was just me and Mayuri. Then, in early May, I finally got Daru to join. All it took was telling him that the lab is just a three minute walk from MayQueen+Nyan².  This location on the outskirts of Akiba has always been quiet. Mayuri isn’t the type to object to every little thing like Kurisu, nor the type to make dumb jokes like Daru, so the lab was very peaceful back in those days. It was quite a pleasant place to be. And now the lab mem count has increased to eight. It happened in the blink of an eye, or so it seems. They didn’t come today, but Lukako visits occasionally, and Faris is a familiar face at MayQueen+Nyan². Or at least she was before MayQueen disappeared. I remember feeling out of place the first time I came to Akiba, but now, it’s like a second home.
Mayuri: "It’s fun♪"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri, too, seems pleased by the increase in lab mems.
Mayuri: "Um, now that there are eight lab mems, Mayushii thinks it’s getting a little cramped in here. First, we don’t have enough chairs."
UNSPOKEN: The sofa only has room for two. Then there’s Daru’s personal desk chair. Those are the only chairs in the lounge. There are some pipe chairs in the development room, but they need to stay there.
Mayuri: "We should buy more. Do you have money, Okarin?"
Rintaro: "New chairs will take all my savings."
UNSPOKEN: Then I’d need to get a part-time job again.
Mayuri: "I guess you can use some of my salary. We need a new microwave too. Otherwise, I can’t warm up my Juicy Chicken Number One."
Rintaro: "Yeah, sorry about that."
UNSPOKEN: Cutting off Mayuri’s chicken supply might actually kill her.
Rintaro: "But Mayuri. When we turn over the Time Leap Machine, the reward money will solve all of our problems."
Mayuri: "Will it be enough to pay for chairs and a microwave on top of the higher rent?"
Rintaro: "It’ll be enough. More than enough."
Mayuri: "Wow! That’s great, Okarin♪"
Rintaro: "Why are you so happy?"
Mayuri: "Just look. We’ve made so many friends. There’s Daru-kun, Chris-chan, Luka-chan, Suzu-san, Moeka-san, Feris-chan, Braun-san, Nae-chan, and more!"
