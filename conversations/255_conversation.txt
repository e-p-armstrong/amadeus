UNSPOKEN: No matter how many times I called her name, Mayuri did not answer. Back then, Mayuri wouldn't talk to anyone. Not to me, not even to her parents. Whenever I saw her standing there, staring at the sky, I felt unease grip my heart. Her gaze was so earnest, her intentions so pure, that I feared some power might grant her wish, and carry her off to heaven to join her beloved grandmother. And so, to ensure that nothing like that happened, I made sure to stop by the cemetery every day. I would stand next to the skygazing Mayuri, and call her name.
Rintaro: Mayuri?
UNSPOKEN: But no matter how many times I'd call her, Mayuri wouldn't reply. The only sound in the lonely cemetery was the echo of my voice, calling her name. It was raining that day, too. Mayuri had a light blue umbrella. In contrast to the umbrella's color, the sky was glazed gray, covered in clouds. After a while, the rain stopped. Rays of light shone through gaps in the clouds, a stunningly beautiful sight. Rembrandt's Rays, they are called, or sometimes the Angel's Ladder. Suddenly, a strong wind swept through the cemetery. It caught Mayuri's umbrella and carried it into the sky. Mayuri seemed not to notice. She kept staring at the sky. And then, slowly... So very slowly... She stretched her hand out to the sky. As if to grasp the rays of light. As if her grandmother were reaching down to pull her up. And then, she lifted herself on her toes. To me, it looked as if she were floating up towards heaven. Impulsively, I grabbed Mayuri's outstretched hand and pulled her into my embrace. In retrospect, my fears were just a childish fantasy, but at the time, I truly believed that Mayuri might vanish.
Rintaro: I won't let you go. I won't let anyone take you away.
UNSPOKEN: I realized how embarrassing the words coming from my own mouth were.
Rintaro: You're my hostage now. My guinea pig!
UNSPOKEN: It was the first excuse that came to mind. Before her grandmother died, Mayuri and I were fans of a popular TV series about costumed heroes battling evil. I particularly admired the villain, a mad scientist. I even got pretty good at mimicking his lines. Now I was doing it to hide my embarrassment. I could feel my face growing red, but I kept up the mad scientist act all the same. If nothing else, it was better than admitting my insecurities.
Rintaro: T-there is no escaping me! Muhaha, muhahaha!
UNSPOKEN: As I said this, I realized that Mayuri was shaking.
Mayuri: Oh... sniff...
UNSPOKEN: She whispered. It was the first time in six months that I had heard her speak. Her voice was choked with tears.
Mayuri: Mayushii's your hostage... I guess I'm stuck here, huh? Ehehe...
