Rintaro: Daru! What day is it!? What time is it!?
Itaru: Uh, ummm, well, it's the 13th... a little past 5.
UNSPOKEN: The 13th, a little past 5...
Rintaro: ...Did it work?
UNSPOKEN: Did I manage to time leap in the middle of all that chaos? Did my memories really jump through time? Does that mean I've leaped into my past self? Is there a chance that it was all a dream? Thinking back -- forward -- it doesn't seem real. Commandos breaking into the lab... it's like something out of a Hollywood movie. But the sight of Mayuri, broken and bloody, is burned into my eyes. I remember the smell of the blood. The sound of the gunshot. The weight of the headgear on my head. The pain of the bullet tearing through my arm. Kurisu screaming. Suzuha fighting to defend us. I remember it all vividly. I touch my arm. No bullet holes. No pain, even. Was it all a dream? I don't know. I've never time leaped before. I can only hope that it was a dream. A future like that... is too much to bear. I recall Mayuri's last moments and my eyes fill with tears. I force the tide of emotion back.
Rintaro: ...Where's Mayuri?
UNSPOKEN: I look around the lab. Kurisu and Daru are here. But I can't find Mayuri.
Rintaro: Where's Mayuri!?
Itaru: Uh, she just left saying she was going to Luka-shi's place. Weren't you listening?
UNSPOKEN: That's right. Mayuri went to beg Lukako to wear her costume. She won't return until it's time for the party. What do I do? What do I believe? Was it a dream? Or was it real? If it was a dream, then I don't have to worry about anything. If it was real, then I need to act. Now. I...
Rintaro: Whew...
UNSPOKEN: I take a deep breath.
Rintaro: It must have been a dream. There's no way something like that could really happen.
UNSPOKEN: It was a nightmare brought on by anxiety. That's all. There's no other logical explanation. I desperately persuade myself that it's so. Little do I know that I will soon regret my foolishness. Kurisu goes shopping alone. I stay in the lab with Daru, waiting for Mayuri to return.
Mayuri: Tutturuâ™ª I'm back!
UNSPOKEN: An innocent smile. Mayuri is alive. Nothing will happen to her. I was worried for nothing. When Suzuha arrives, we begin the meeting.
Mayuri: Okarin, Okarin. I called Feris-chan and Luka-chan, but they said they couldn't come.
UNSPOKEN: I've heard these words before. Deja vu. A trick of the mind.
Rintaro: Oh. Do they have plans?
Mayuri: Feris-chan has a RaiNet tournament.
Itaru: Crap, I should've gone to cheer! How careless of me!
Mayuri: And Luka-chan seemed embarrassed for some reason.
Kurisu: Maybe she thinks you'll make her wear a costume again.
