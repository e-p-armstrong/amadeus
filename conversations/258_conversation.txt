Mayuri: Um, guys? Mayushii doesn't like it when you fight. Let's all get along, okay?
UNSPOKEN: Daru comes over to chat with Suzuha, and gradually peace returns to the lab. Kurisu is in the development room, making a call. Probably to her mother in America. I sit on the sofa and watch TV while sipping Dr P. But I can't pay attention to what I see on the screen. It doesn't enter my head. Mayuri sits down next to me. She peels a banana and begins eating it.
Mayuri: Hey, Okarin. It's been really lively here these past few weeks, huh?
UNSPOKEN: Stop it. Why are you saying the same things as in that terrible dream? It was a dream. It has to be a dream.
Mayuri: It's funâ™ª
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri smiles happily, not noticing my lack of a reply.
Mayuri: Um, now that there are eight lab mems, Mayushii thinks it's getting a little cramped in here. First, we don't have enough chairs. We should buy more. Do you have money, Okarin?
UNSPOKEN: I shake my head wordlessly. For some reason, I'm afraid to look Mayuri in the face.
Mayuri: I guess you can use some of my salary. We need a new microwave too. Otherwise, I can't warm up any Juicy Chicken Number One. Okarin... are you okay? You don't look so good.
Rintaro: It's nothing...
Mayuri: Are you feeling sick? Then you need to rest. Want to lie down? You can lie on my lap, okay?
Rintaro: I'm not--
UNSPOKEN: Before I can finish, the television interrupts me with an urgent news bulletin. The subtitles read Terrorist bomb threat suspends Yamanote, Sobu, Keihin-Tohoku lines.
Suzuha: A bomb threat?
Itaru: Hang on. Those lines all pass through Akiba. How is Mayu-shi gonna get home?
Mayuri: Oh yeah. I should call home.
Rintaro: No... it can't be...
UNSPOKEN: It's the same. Every last thing, the same.
Suzuha: Okabe Rintaro. I need to know.
UNSPOKEN: It was a dream.
Suzuha: You've completed the Time Leap Machine, right?
UNSPOKEN: It had to be a dream. But if it was a dream, then why...
Suzuha: Are you listening?
Itaru: Uh, the Time Leap Machine's done.
Suzuha: Okay. I just remembered I've got something to do. I'm going out.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha leaves the lab without another word.
Kurisu: What's wrong with her?
