Kurisu: "Okabe..."
Rintaro: "I’m going back!"
Kurisu: "No! I should be the one to--"
UNSPOKEN: I grab Kurisu’s wrist as she tries to take it back. I stare into her eyes, eyes wet with tears.
Rintaro: "I will save Mayuri!"
Kurisu: "But what if it fails!?"
UNSPOKEN: I ignore her and put on the headgear. Moeka’s last shot grazed the side of my head. My ears are still ringing, and there’s blood on my neck. It doesn’t matter. I might fail. I might even die. But I have to try. It’s my only chance to save Mayuri. Kurisu bites her lip and activates the X68000.
Suzuha: "Okabe Rintaro! One of them’s moving!"
Moeka: "Get in there! Kill them!"
Attacker A: "Damn... kids!"
UNSPOKEN: The crew-cut man staggers into the development room. Acting purely on instinct, I grab Future Gadget No. 4: Moad Snake from the shelf and flick the switch. White smoke instantly fills the room, rendering it impossible to see.
Moeka: "Kill them!"
Kurisu: "Augh!"
Rintaro: "Kurisu!?"
Kurisu: "Ugh, gh, Okabe!! Are you sure!? Are you sure about this!? Really!?"
Rintaro: "Do it, Kurisu! Activate the machine! Agh!"
UNSPOKEN: Pain flares in my right arm. Was I shot? It doesn’t matter. I see blue-white light shining through the smoke. The discharge is starting! The light rapidly grows brighter. The floor begins to shake. The singularity is open! I crouch down, holding the headset steady with one hand. Wait for me, Mayuri! I won’t die here! I’ll cross through time to save you! Leap, my memories. Leap to the past!
Rintaro: "Leaaaaaaaap!!"
UNSPOKEN: The world explodes into light.
Rintaro: "Mayuri? ...Mayuri?"
UNSPOKEN: No matter how many times I call her name... Mayuri doesn’t answer. Mayuri is standing in front of a grave, gazing at the sky. The grave belongs to her grandmother, who died when Mayuri was eleven years old. Her parents were always busy with work, so her grandmother was her only companion.  I was close to Mayuri’s family, so her death was sad for me too. At the wake, I expected Mayuri to break down and cry. She didn’t. Instead, she spent the whole time gazing vacantly at her grandmother’s memorial portrait. Six months went by. I had advanced to middle school, so Mayuri and I no longer commuted together. But whenever I passed the cemetery on the way home, Mayuri would always be standing there. Every day, rain or shine, she would stand for hours before the grave, staring wordlessly at the sky as if she could see her grandmother in heaven. In her hands, an old pocket watch. The watch had belonged to her grandmother. Mayuri always held it when visiting the grave.
Rintaro: "Mayuri?"
