UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, the shattered pieces of the world reform. I slowly come back to my senses. I’m in the lab, standing in front of the PhoneWave (name subject to change) with my cellphone to my ear. No, not the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Since headgear is attached to it, it’s the Time Leap Machine. It’s hard to breathe. Give me oxygen. I hear a low, wheezing groan and realize that it’s coming from my own throat.
Rintaro: "Ahhh..."
UNSPOKEN: I close my mouth, then take a deep breath.
Rintaro: "...ckhaah, haahh, haahh, hah..."
UNSPOKEN: The insides of my throat feel like they’re burning. I resist the urge to cough and continue filling my lungs with air. I notice that I’m drenched in sweat. The drops sliding down my forehead are annoying. I try to wipe them away with the back of my right hand. My hand obeys... slowly. Something is off. It’s like my body and my mind aren’t totally in sync with each other. Almost as if this isn’t really my body. As if my nerves aren’t communicating properly with my extremities. I try blinking slowly. This might just be my imagination. Could this be exhaustion? I haven’t slept much lately. I try to move my hand again. There is no disconnect this time. This is my body.
Kurisu: "Okabe? Are you listening?"
UNSPOKEN: A familiar voice. I turn around slowly. Kurisu is there. She stares at me, perplexed.
Kurisu: "What was all that screaming for?"
UNSPOKEN: What is she talking about?
Kurisu: "Are you sick?"
UNSPOKEN: I try answering, but my voice doesn’t work too well. Even more bewildered, I clear my throat several times.
Rintaro: "...No, I’m fine."
Kurisu: "Then get ready to go already. We’re going shopping, remember?"
Rintaro: "...Shopping?"
UNSPOKEN: For what? I search my memories. The moment I do, images appear in my mind like a string of exploding lightbulbs.
Kurisu: "’Humans are temporal beings.’"
Mayuri: "But now you’re fine."
Kurisu: "Are you sure about this!? Really!?"
Rintaro: "Ah... ah..."
UNSPOKEN: I remember now. I used the Time Leap Machine.
Kurisu: "You’ll remember the future."
UNSPOKEN: That’s right! What am I standing around for!?
Rintaro: "Where am I?"
Kurisu: "Huh?"
UNSPOKEN: I grab Kurisu’s shoulders and pull her close.
Rintaro: "What time is it now!? What month? What day!?"
Kurisu: "Hey, that hurts! Calm down!"
Rintaro: "How can I be calm!? Shopping? You said we’re going shopping?"
UNSPOKEN: Which shopping trip is she talking about? Daru is sitting at his computer, staring at us wide-eyed.
Rintaro: "Daru! What day is it!? What time is it!?"
Itaru: "Uh, ummm, well, it’s the 13th... a little past 5."
UNSPOKEN: The 13th, a little past 5...
Rintaro: "...Did it work?"
