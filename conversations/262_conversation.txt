UNSPOKEN: I look around the lab. Kurisu and Daru are here. But I can’t find Mayuri.
Rintaro: "Where’s Mayuri!?"
Itaru: "Uh, she just left saying she was going to Luka-shi’s place. Weren’t you listening?"
UNSPOKEN: That’s right. Mayuri went to beg Lukako to wear her costume. She won’t return until it’s time for the party. What do I do? What do I believe? Was it a dream? Or was it real? If it was a dream, then I don’t have to worry about anything. If it was real, then I need to act. Now. I...
Rintaro: "Whew..."
UNSPOKEN: I take a deep breath.
Rintaro: "It must have been a dream. There’s no way something like that could really happen."
UNSPOKEN: It was a nightmare brought on by anxiety. That’s all. There’s no other logical explanation. I desperately persuade myself that it’s so. Little do I know that I will soon regret my foolishness. Kurisu goes shopping alone. I stay in the lab with Daru, waiting for Mayuri to return.
Mayuri: "Tutturu♪ I’m back!"
UNSPOKEN: An innocent smile. Mayuri is alive. Nothing will happen to her. I was worried for nothing. When Suzuha arrives, we begin the meeting.
Mayuri: "Okarin, Okarin. I called Feris-chan and Luka-chan, but they said they couldn’t come."
UNSPOKEN: I’ve heard these words before. Deja vu. A trick of the mind.
Rintaro: "Oh. Do they have plans?"
Mayuri: "Feris-chan has a RaiNet tournament."
Itaru: "Crap, I should’ve gone to cheer! How careless of me!"
Mayuri: "And Luka-chan seemed embarrassed for some reason."
Kurisu: "Maybe she thinks you’ll make her wear a costume again."
UNSPOKEN: It’s just like my dream. I’ve never remembered a dream this vividly before. I remember every word that was spoken.
Rintaro: "You still haven’t convinced her to cosplay?"
Mayuri: "She said it was embarrassing. I keep telling her ’Cuteness is Justice’, but she never listens..."
Kurisu: "’Cuteness is Justice’... is that what they say?"
Mayuri: "You’re cute too, Chris-chan!"
Kurisu: "Hah? Eh?"
Mayuri: "Hey, ComiMa’s coming up. Wanna go? I can’t make something new, but I have a costume of Post-Awakening Seira from Blood Tune I made last year. I think the size is just right for you too."
Kurisu: "Me, cosplay? I’m sorta interested. But I refuse to do it in public, though."
Mayuri: "You don’t have to show anyone, but eventually, you’ll want them to see. The cosplay demon compels you! That reminds me. Chris-chan, you’re always wearing that cute uniform. What school is it from?"
Kurisu: "Oh, this? I attended Ayamein for about two weeks. I modeled this outfit after their uniform."
Mayuri: "Oh! Their uniform is really cute, but you made it even cuter! You might have really good design sense♪ I’ll bring the costume tomorrow, okay? Will you try it on then?"
