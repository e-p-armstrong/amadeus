UNSPOKEN: I run full speed to Yanabayashi Shrine. Naturally, I have to stop for breath before I get more than a few blocks. The sun is setting, but the temperature still hasn't dropped below 30. Sweat quickly covers my entire body. I'm not good at exercise in the first place. I finally stagger through the archway. Now I regret not borrowing Suzuha's bicycle. But no, there wasn't time for that. Finding Mayuri comes first. I run to the courtyard, where I find Lukako standing alone with her bamboo broom.
Rintaro: Lukako!
Luka: ...Ah, Okabe-san!
UNSPOKEN: She bows her head.
Luka: What's wrong?
Rintaro: Mayuri! Where's Mayuri!?
Luka: Um, Mayuri-chan already left.
Rintaro: She left!?
Luka: Yes... Um... when you see her, could you tell her that I'm sorry? I'd really prefer not to cosplay... I don't want to disappoint her, but it's too embarrassing to dress like that in front of people...
UNSPOKEN: I finally catch my breath. I don't have time to listen to Lukako's apologies.
Rintaro: Mayuri went back to the lab?
Luka: Eh? Um... I think so.
UNSPOKEN: That doesn't make sense. I know she comes to the lab around 6:30. It's still 5:30. No matter how slowly you walk, it shouldn't take more than 20 minutes to get to the lab. So what was she doing for the extra forty minutes? We don't have time for this!
Rintaro: She didn't say she was dropping by somewhere?
Luka: No... I didn't ask... Um... is something wrong?
Rintaro: If Mayuri comes back here, tell her to call me right away!
Luka: O-okay!
UNSPOKEN: I'd better check the lab. We might have missed each other. When I get back to the lab, nobody's there but Daru. Did Kurisu go shopping by herself? I call out to him as he's ordering pizza on the computer.
Rintaro: Where's Mayuri!? Did she come back!?
Itaru: Huh? No.
Rintaro: Kuh! Where is she!?
UNSPOKEN: I take a bottle of Dr P out of the fridge and chug it down. The cold, sparkling liquid wets my parched throat and drives the heat away. Now I can think. But I still can't relax. Every minute -- every second -- is precious. Each moment I waste brings me closer to Mayuri's death.
Itaru: Hey, Okarin. Why are you so jumpy?
Rintaro: I need to find Mayuri!
Itaru: Isn't she at Luka-shi's?
Rintaro: Not anymore. She was gone by the time I got there.
UNSPOKEN: I start to pace in irritation.
Itaru: Maybe she went to see one of her cosplay friends?
Rintaro: Who? What's her phone number?
Itaru: How should I know?
