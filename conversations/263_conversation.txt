Rintaro: Do you know something!?
Itaru: I think she said that her phone was about to run out of power. She had to turn it off.
UNSPOKEN: Yet another setback. Not only am I unable to contact her, she might not even notice my phone calls.
Itaru: Hey, what's going on?
Rintaro: ...Why are you still here, Daru? I thought I told you to leave!
UNSPOKEN: I sit on the sofa. I feel the weight of stress on my shoulders and in my bones.
Itaru: I'm not leaving without a good reason. Tell me what's going on, man.
Rintaro: ...They're going to kill Mayuri.
Itaru: What?
Rintaro: SERN's after us. In two hours, their men will break in and kill Mayuri. Get out while you still can!
Itaru: What? For real?
Rintaro: Can you get in touch with Kurisu? Pass the message onto her.
Itaru: In two hours? How do you know that?
UNSPOKEN: Daru pauses for a moment. He looks towards the development room, where the Time Leap Machine is sitting.
Itaru: No way. You used it?
UNSPOKEN: I nod gravely. I kick Daru out of the lab and send him home. He promised to call Kurisu for me and tell her to stay at her hotel, but a few minutes later, she calls me directly and demands an explanation. It takes some effort, but I manage to convince her to do as I say. Now I just need to wait for Mayuri to get back. I thought about looking for her, but it's too risky. We could miss each other like we did at the shrine. Better to wait here in front of the building. While waiting, I try to convince myself that everything will be okay. Mayuri returns to the lab at 6:30. That leaves about an hour before Moeka's attack. In an hour, we could ride the bullet train from Tokyo Station to Shizuoka. Is that the best plan? Maybe we should get off at Yokohama and lay low in a hotel for a while. I can think about what comes next after Mayuri's safe. The Time Leap Machine doesn't matter. Moeka can have it. My top priority is to prevent Mayuri's death. Sweat accumulates on my forehead and rolls down my face. Hurry back, Mayuri.
Suzuha: Huh?
UNSPOKEN: Startled, I turn towards the voice. Suzuha and Mister Braun have emerged from the Braun Tube Workshop. I see them lock the door. Guess they're closing up shop. That's right, I forgot about Suzuha.
Suzuha: What are you doing here, Okabe Rintaro?
Rintaro: Nothing...
UNSPOKEN: That reminds me. During the attack, she took down five armed commandos in the blink of an eye. I still can't believe it. Where does an 18-year-old girl learn to move like that? And then there was her strange behavior immediately before the attack. She left as soon as she heard about the bomb threat, almost as if she knew something was going to happen. And finally, there's that business with her father. Everything about her is a mystery. Who is Amane Suzuha?
Suzuha: Oh, I know! You're getting ready for that party tonight, aren't you?
Rintaro: How did you know we're having a party?
