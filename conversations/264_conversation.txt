UNSPOKEN: Daru clutches his head and falls to his knees, screaming at the top of his lungs. In my arms, Mayuri takes one long, ragged breath. And then...
Mayuri: "O...kari..."
Kurisu: "No... no!"
UNSPOKEN: She’s dead. Mayuri’s dead. Again. Her face is covered in blood. Her blood stains my hands. It’s warm.
Moeka: "You three come with us. Now. No more warnings. Resist, and we will kill you too."
UNSPOKEN: I hear a voice. But I can’t comprehend what it’s saying. It’s the same. I knew it would be. I let Mayuri die again. Because I didn’t believe my own memories of the future. I lay Mayuri down on the floor. I’m sorry, Mayuri. I’m so sorry... I stand up. Rage takes hold of me once again. I’m helpless to resist. I take one menacing step towards Moeka.
Kurisu: "Okabe!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu grabs my hand before I can take another.
Kurisu: "You can’t!"
Rintaro: "Let me go!"
Kurisu: "You can’t! They’ll kill you!"
UNSPOKEN: Moeka’s gun is aimed at my head. Her finger is already on the trigger.
Rintaro: "You gonna kill me too!?"
Moeka: "If you resist."
Kurisu: "Please, Okabe, do what she says. Okay? Otherwise, they’ll kill you too."
Rintaro: "Gh...!"
UNSPOKEN: I grit my teeth and suppress my anger. Just then, something small and round strikes Moeka’s gun hand.
Moeka: "...!?"
UNSPOKEN: She drops her gun. At her feet lies a small stone.
Suzuha: "Get down!"
Attacker B: "Gweh!!"
UNSPOKEN: The next events transpire exactly as I remember. Suzuha appears in the doorway, knocking down the first man before anyone can react. She then proceeds to dispatch the remaining men with a series of swift, precise maneuvers.
Attacker A: "Who the hell!?"
UNSPOKEN: The dark-skinned man, the last one standing, takes aim at Suzuha with his assault rifle. But before he can fire, Suzuha snatches a stunned attacker’s gun and shoots him.
Attacker A: "Gwah!!"
UNSPOKEN: Blood spurts from the man’s hand. Without stopping, Suzuha delivers a soaring roundhouse kick to the man’s jaw.
Moeka: "Enough."
Suzuha: "!!"
UNSPOKEN: Moeka and Suzuha point their guns at each other. A standoff. Neither moves. Silence returns to the room.
Moeka: "...Who are you?"
Suzuha: "42."
UNSPOKEN: She glances at me.
Suzuha: "TV."
UNSPOKEN: This time, I already know what she means.
Suzuha: "Turned on."
UNSPOKEN: I make a break for the development room.
Moeka: "Don’t move!"
Suzuha: "That’s my line!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu is right behind me. I grab the headgear and jam it on my head without a moment’s hesitation.
Kurisu: "Okabe, I--"
Rintaro: "I’m going back!"
Kurisu: "But what if it fails!?"
Rintaro: "Get the machine started!"
