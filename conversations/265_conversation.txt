UNSPOKEN: Before the crew-cut man enters the development room, I push the switch. White smoke instantly fills the room, rendering it impossible to see.
Kurisu: "Are you sure, Okabe!? Are you sure about this!? Really!?"
Rintaro: "Do it, Kurisu! Activate the machine!"
UNSPOKEN: I see blue-white light shining through the smoke. The discharge is starting! The light rapidly grows brighter. The floor begins to shake. The singularity is open! I crouch down, holding the headset steady with one hand. This is reality. It wasn’t a dream. I burn that fact into my mind as I prepare to time leap. One more chance... The shaking begins.
Rintaro: "Please! Give me one more chance!"
UNSPOKEN: Once more, the world explodes into light. I can’t hear. It feels like something is crushing my eardrums.
Rintaro: "Ah!"
UNSPOKEN: Slowly, the shattered pieces of the world reform. My body convulses as if struck by lightning. I... am Okabe Rintaro. I’m in the lab development room, standing in front of the Time Leap Machine with my phone to my ear.
Rintaro: "...Gh."
UNSPOKEN: My brain hurts again. This isn’t like a headache. It’s somehow deeper. With the pain comes a torrent of emotions -- sorrow, longing, hope, joy -- that threatens to wash away my psyche. However, only one thing matters.
Rintaro: "...It worked again."
UNSPOKEN: I quickly return to the lounge.
Kurisu: "Kya! You surprised me!"
UNSPOKEN: I almost crashed into Kurisu.
Kurisu: "Don’t startle me like that."
Rintaro: "Daru! Is it just before 5 on the 13th!?"
Itaru: "Eh? Um... yeah?"
UNSPOKEN: Alright. Time leap successful. I pat Kurisu on the shoulders, almost in an embrace.
Rintaro: "You’re a genius."
Kurisu: "W-what’s gotten in to you? Stop manhandling me. It’s gross."
UNSPOKEN: I scramble for my phone.
Mayuri: "Tutturu♪ Mayushii here."
Rintaro: "Mayuri! Where are--"
Mayuri: "But I can’t answer the phone right now."
UNSPOKEN: ...It went to voice mail?
Mayuri: "Please leave your message after the beep♪"
Rintaro: "Mayuri! Contact me at once! Okay? At once!"
UNSPOKEN: I hang up. I look at my watch again. It’s just past 5. Thank god for the Time Leap Machine. It makes me shiver to imagine what would have happened without it. I have three hours until Moeka kills Mayuri. Everything’s going to be okay. That’s plenty of time to escape. First, I’ll meet up with Mayuri and leave Akiba. We can go to Ikebukuro. Wait, what if they’re watching her house? Maybe we should hop the bullet train and get out of Tokyo entirely. Anyway, we’re fine as long as Moeka doesn’t find her today. So first, I need to find Mayuri.
Kurisu: "Okabe? You look kind of crazy. What’s wrong?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu and Daru look at me with concern.
Rintaro: "Both of you get out of here. Now."
Kurisu: "...What’s this about?"
