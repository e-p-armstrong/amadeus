Rintaro: No... stopping... until... we're on... the train...
UNSPOKEN: I do my best to keep up the pace.
Mayuri: But Okarin, you're covered in sweat. You shouldn't push yourself. You're not good at exercise.
UNSPOKEN: When we reach the station, I realize that something is wrong. The station is packed. Seriously packed. You don't see this many people even at rush hour. The crowd is milling around the entrance. For some reason, it looks like no one is going in. What's going on here? A protest? Some kind of street performance? I don't have time for this! Just then, an announcement plays over the PA.
Premise Announcer: Your attention please. The Yamanote, Keihin-Tohoku, and Sobu Lines are currently suspended. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, and kindly ask for your cooperation.
UNSPOKEN: Finally, I realize my mistake. That's right. Before the attack, the trains were stopped by a bomb threat! No wonder there are so many people standing around. In my haste to flee the city, I completely forgot! How could I have been so stupid!?
Mayuri: I wonder what happened...
UNSPOKEN: All of the train lines are stopped. We can't escape Akiba! What about other means of public transportation -- the subway or the bus? Should we go to another station? I turn around and head back the way we came, keeping a firm grip on Mayuri's hand. But before we get more than a few steps, a man steps out of the crowd and blocks our way. I realize that we're surrounded.
???: Okabe Rintaro?
UNSPOKEN: A low voice. A face I've never seen. He's not one of the five who broke into the lab.
Mayuri: Okarin, do you know these people?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri grips my arm tightly as she looks anxiously at the men.
???: Come with us.
Rintaro: Who are you?
UNSPOKEN: Instead of answering, the man makes a grab for my arm. I jerk away and try to escape, but the men move to block us again.
???: If you resist, we'll kill you.
Rintaro: SERN!
UNSPOKEN: They're with Moeka!? She must have planned for this in advance. A chill runs up my spine. We made a terrible mistake when we hacked into SERN. I realize that now, though it's far too late.
Rintaro: Are you going to kill us with all these witnesses around?
