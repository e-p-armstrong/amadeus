UNSPOKEN: I grab Mayuri's hand and start running. We have to fight our way through the crowd, but that also thwarts our pursuers. As soon as we reach the main street, we start running back towards the lab. Of course, we can't return to the lab itself. Moeka's group will be there shortly. Is the subway still running? If we get on at Suehirocho Station, we can take the Ginza line to Shibuya. From there, we can grab a train heading out of Tokyo. I still haven't recovered from my exhaustion. I don't know how much longer I can hold on. We can't stop now. I have to keep running. It doesn't take long before a new obstacle appears. Four men walking together up ahead suddenly stop and turn to face us. I've got a bad feeling about this. They don't look like otaku. Are they with SERN too? My fears are confirmed when the four men start walking towards us, arms spread to block the street. No doubt about it. They're after us too! I turn to flee back towards the station, and there I see the first group of men closing in behind us. We're trapped. Enemies on both sides. There's only one choice. I grab Mayuri and make for the nearby side street.
Mayuri: Where are we going, Okarin!?
UNSPOKEN: I'm trying to get to Suehirocho Station without using the main streets. But as we pass UPX, several men on the bridge point at us and shout something. Are they with SERN too!? How many men do they have!? We turn back and change course.
Rintaro: Haah, haah, okay, Mayuri, you're, a faster, haah, haah, runner, so...
UNSPOKEN: Talking while running uses up all of my breath. Sweat drips into my eyes, making it hard to see.
Rintaro: You, go on, ahead! Go, to Hariti shrine, in Ikebukuro. We'll meet--
UNSPOKEN: Before I finish, I catch sight of another group of men waiting for us up ahead.
Mayuri: What's going on, Okarin!?
UNSPOKEN: I look back. The group from before is chasing us. We're surrounded by enemies. The familiar streets of Akiba are filled with agents of SERN. I recall what Moeka said.
Moeka: You have nowhere to run. We have men stationed throughout Akihabara.
UNSPOKEN: Despair seizes my heart. Is escape impossible? We're just kids playing at science in the safety of our tiny little lab. Our enemy is a multinational conspiracy willing to kill anyone who gets in their way. Were we doomed from the start? No! No matter what, we must get away! Leading Mayuri by the hand, I push my way through the crowd, then jump the fence onto the road.
Rintaro: ...!?
UNSPOKEN: Something strikes me with crushing force, sending me tumbling across the pavement. I come to a stop several meters away. My body is wracked with intense pain.
Rintaro: Gah...hah...
