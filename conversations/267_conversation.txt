Mayuri: Okarin♪
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri waves her hand happily. Lukako bows her head.
Mayuri: Are you here to back me up?
Rintaro: Back you up?
Mayuri: To help convince Luka-chan to wear my costume!
Luka: Mayuri-chan, I really can't. It's too embarrassing...
Mayuri: Hey, Okarin. Can you think of some way to persuade Luka-chan? Mayushii can't reach the ending for the Luka-chan route.
Luka: I keep telling her I can't... but Mayuri-chan just won't give up.
UNSPOKEN: Tears well up in my eyes. I grit my teeth and resist the urge to cry. To see them talking, so happy and carefree... I thought that this peace would last forever. And yet...
Rintaro: I'm sorry, you two. Save the cosplay talk for later.
UNSPOKEN: I grab Mayuri's hand.
Rintaro: Drop your bags, Mayuri. Leave them with Lukako.
Mayuri: Huh? What's going on?
Rintaro: We're leaving town.
Mayuri: Leaving town? We're going on a trip?
Luka: A... trip?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako's face turns red.
Luka: Just the two of you?
Rintaro: That's right.
UNSPOKEN: I'll let Lukako misunderstand whatever she wants. I take off running, half dragging Mayuri along. We get out to Manseibashi Bridge. Now I need to figure out where we go from here. It's half past 4. We should still have about three hours before the trains stop. If we wanted to, we could even leave from Akiba station. But that seems like a bad idea. Moeka and her men might already be there. We should board from another station. If the plan is to head for Yokohama, the fastest way is to take the bullet train from Tokyo Station. To get to Tokyo Station without passing through Akihabara Station means boarding at Kanda or Awajicho. We could walk to Tokyo Station in an hour, but I don't want to waste that much time.
Mayuri: Where are we going, Okarin? What's the rush?
Rintaro: SERN's after us.
Mayuri: Huh? What does that mean?
Rintaro: I'll explain later. First we need to get out of Akiba.
Mayuri: O-okay...
UNSPOKEN: I decide on Awajicho Station and start running. If we can make it to Yasukuni-dori, the station's right there. But I freeze when I see a group of six men walking just ahead. Are they Moeka's men? I don't know, but we can't take the chance. I pull Mayuri into a nearby alley. How many men does SERN have? When did these patrols start? Are they watching stations besides Akihabara? I have no way of knowing. To make matters worse, SERN's assassins are indistinguishable from ordinary shoppers at a glance. You can tell they're different when you get close, but by then it's too late. They could be anyone. Japanese, foreigners, anyone. Damn! What should we do? Should we take the shortest route and risk being seen? Or should we stick to the back streets and stay out of sight?
Mayuri: Okarin... Mayushii's kinda scared...
