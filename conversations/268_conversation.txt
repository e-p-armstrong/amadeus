Rintaro: Hide!
UNSPOKEN: I pull Mayuri into the entrance of a nearby building. Several young men pass by. They're not particularly fit, and each of them is carrying a bag full of computer parts. I don't think they're the enemy. But I can't be sure. The only way to be safe is to treat every group of men as a potential threat. At this rate, it'll be night before we escape Akiba. Maybe we should just go for it and hope to get lucky. I look up the closest station with my phone. Ochanomizu and Suehirocho are about equidistant from our current position. Suehirocho takes us near the lab, but Ochanomizu is on the same line as Akihabara. It might be affected by the bomb threat. An impasse.
Rintaro: Mayuri, stay right here. Don't move until I get back.
Mayuri: Where are you going?
Rintaro: To the station to make sure it's safe.
UNSPOKEN: And while I'm at it, scout the streets between here and there. We'll need to use the shortest route.
Mayuri: Mayushii doesn't want to be left alone...
Rintaro: I'll be right back. If I'm not back in 30 minutes, call someone. Kurisu or Suzuha. Have them get you out of Akiba.
Mayuri: Don't say that! Come back, okay? If you don't, Mayushii won't know what to do...
Rintaro: Okay. I'll come back. I promise.
UNSPOKEN: I leave Mayuri behind and run to Ochanomizu Station. Wary of surrounding eyes, I scout the streets and decide that the back alleys of Kanda Myojin will give us the best chance of avoiding detection. Once we make it to the station, we'll just have to pray. I race back to the spot I left Mayuri.
Rintaro: Mayuri!
UNSPOKEN: She's not there. For an instant, I think I got the place mixed up, so I check the entrance of the next building. But Mayuri isn't there either. She's gone.
Rintaro: I told her not to move!
