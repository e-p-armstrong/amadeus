Rintaro: "How did you know we’re having a party?"
Suzuha: "Shiina Mayuri. She came by earlier today to invite me over. Hope you’ve got room for one more, ’cuz I’m--"
Rintaro: "You can’t!"
Suzuha: "Um... am I a bother?"
Rintaro: "...No."
Suzuha: "It’s okay. I understand. I guess I’m still an outsider."
Rintaro: "That’s not it!"
Tennouji: "What’s wrong with you, Okabe? Let my part-timer join your little club. You owe her, remember? It’s thanks to her belly that I let ya’ off the hook for shaking the building last time."
Suzuha: "My belly? Hey!"
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha has recovered her jacket. She’s properly dressed now.
Tennouji: "She’s got a fine belly. Tight and well trained."
Suzuha: "I’m standing right here, you dirty old man."
Rintaro: "The party is canceled. I’m sorry, Part-Time Warrior, but please go home today."
Suzuha: "Canceled?"
Rintaro: "Yeah. Sorry."
UNSPOKEN: I attempt a smile, but with little hope of success.
Tennouji: "I don’t know what’s going on, Okabe, but don’t do anything reckless."
Rintaro: "...Huh?"
UNSPOKEN: It’s weird to have him give me advice. I thought he was just a dirty old man who loved CRTs. Maybe he’s sharper than I thought. Or maybe he’s just telling me to stop shaking the building.
Rintaro: "I... got in a fight with Mayuri. Things are a little complicated right now. That’s all."
UNSPOKEN: That’s the best lie I can manage.
Suzuha: "Oh, is there gonna be blood?"
UNSPOKEN: Blood?
Suzuha: "I mean, look over there."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha points across the street. I turn to look. To my surprise, there’s Mayuri walking up the street with a big bag. When she notices us, she waves her hand with a ditzy smile. Mayuri!
Suzuha: "Huh? Weren’t you fighting? She looks really happy to see you."
UNSPOKEN: I ignore Suzuha and run to Mayuri. The clock on my phone says 6:33.
Suzuha: "Hey! Where are you going!?"
UNSPOKEN: I wasted precious time talking to Suzuha. Now that I’ve secured Mayuri, we need to get as far away from Akiba as we can!
Mayuri: "What’s the rush, Okarin?"
UNSPOKEN: I ignore her question and grab her hand.
Rintaro: "Run! To the station!"
Mayuri: "Wawawa... W-w-wait! My bag..."
Rintaro: "Forget it! Just run!"
Mayuri: "Eh? Why?"
Rintaro: "Just run!"
UNSPOKEN: I can’t get the image of Mayuri’s death out of my mind. I won’t let them kill her. I won’t. Mayuri gives no further resistance. She follows obediently, quickly matching my pace. I forgot that she’s faster on her feet than I am.
Mayuri: "Hey, where are we going?"
Rintaro: "Haah, haah, haah, first we’ll head for, haah, Tsukuba or Yokohama..."
