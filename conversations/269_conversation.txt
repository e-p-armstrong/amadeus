Mayuri: Um, Okarin? Mayushii has a lot of questions, but she'll wait for now. But once it's over, I want you to tell me everything, okay?
Rintaro: Yeah, I promise.
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri smiles happily at that answer. That's right. While we wait for the train, I should ask Mayuri about her whereabouts today. If -- if -- I have to leap again, I'll need all the information I can get.
Rintaro: Where did you go after you saw Lukako?
Mayuri: I got an email from Fubuki-chan. A thread came loose on her costume. I went to fix it.
Rintaro: Where does Fubuki-chan live?
Mayuri: Um, we met at the Starbecks at UPX.
UNSPOKEN: So that's where she was. Just then, an announcement plays over the PA system. The subway is resuming normal operations. About 20 minutes have passed since we arrived. I didn't expect to be stuck here that long, but it's okay. Right now, Moeka should be in Akihabara, heading to the lab. Everything is going to be alright. While waiting for the train, I examine the route map on the station's noticeboard. We can transfer to an overland train at Yoyogi-Uehara. It'll take a while, but that will take us all the way to Odawara. Another announcement. Our train is arriving. I can hear the rumbling and see the lights at the end of the tunnel. Mayuri and I are standing just behind the white line. I reach for her hand, meaning to make a dash for the train when the doors open, but I guess there's no hurry now. I let my hand fall to my side, empty. The roar comes closer.
Mayuri: About the party tonight...
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri is saying something. I can't quite hear her over the train.
Mayuri: It got canceled, but we should definitely--
Nae: Mayuriâ™ª
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Mayuri disappears.
Rintaro: Huh?
