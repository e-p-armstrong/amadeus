Kurisu: "Don’t shout... I’ve been working all night, so let me rest a bit..."
Rintaro: "Where is Mayuri!?"
Itaru: "What’s wrong with you? She went to Luka-shi’s, remember?"
UNSPOKEN: Damn, she already left? I should call or send a mail. I need to get in touch with her somehow! Mayuri went to see someone after leaving the shrine. The question is who. Think. Consider every possibility!
Mayuri: "Tutturu♪ Mayushii here."
Rintaro: "Mayuri! Where are--"
Mayuri: "But I can’t answer the phone right now."
UNSPOKEN: ...I got her voice mail?
Mayuri: "Please leave your message after the beep♪"
UNSPOKEN: ...It’s the same as last time. Damn! Why did I forget? Before I time leaped, I should have asked Mayuri where she was today. I’m not thinking straight. I have to calm down. Wait... I know. Last time, we failed because we went to Akihabara Station. I should have known that SERN would be watching. This time, we’ll take a taxi to another station, then hide somewhere until things calm down. For now, all I can do is wait for Mayuri to return. It’s driving me crazy. I consider explaining the situation to Kurisu and Daru, but I just don’t have the strength to do that right now. Besides, I don’t want to get them involved. I’ll take care of it myself. I won’t let any more of my friends die.
Luka: "Hello. This is Urushibara."
Rintaro: "Lukako! It’s me! Okabe!"
Luka: "Okabe-san? What’s wrong?"
Rintaro: "Is Mayuri there? If she is, let me speak to her!"
Luka: "Okay. Just a moment please."
Mayuri: "Tutturu♪ Mayushii here. What’s up, Okarin?"
UNSPOKEN: Finally... I’ve managed to get ahold of Mayuri. This will give us hours to spare.
Rintaro: "Where are you now? Yanabayashi Shrine!?"
Mayuri: "Yup!"
Rintaro: "I’m headed there now. Whatever you do, don’t move, okay!?"
Mayuri: "Huh? Why not?"
Kurisu: "What’s all the commotion?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu’s eyes are half asleep.
Rintaro: "Daru. Assistant. Leave right now and get as far from Akiba as you can. But under no circumstances use the train."
Itaru: "What? Why?"
Rintaro: "If you can, go somewhere you don’t normally go, and stay there overnight. Understand?"
Itaru: "Wait, overnight? So you’re saying we should go to a love hotel and make hanky panky. I understand."
Kurisu: "Shut it, perv."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu gets up.
Kurisu: "What’s going on, Okabe?"
Rintaro: "Please, just do as I say. We’ll talk later. Don’t come back to the lab until I say so!"
