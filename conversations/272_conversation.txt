Kurisu: Tell me what happened. I know you used the Time Leap Machine.
Rintaro: ...What?
UNSPOKEN: I look up in surprise. Kurisu doesn't meet my stare. Instead, she leans on the guard rail and gazes down at the plaza with her usual frown.
Kurisu: You get a phone call, and suddenly you're like a different person. It was obvious.
Rintaro: I came from three hours in the future.
Kurisu: What happened?
Rintaro: They... killed Mayuri.
UNSPOKEN: I lower my head, trying to hold back the tears. Then I explain about SERN and Moeka, and about how Kurisu herself activated the Time Leap Machine and made this possible. I tell her about my previous leaps. I explain that the world itself wants Mayuri dead, that I can't save her no matter how I try. I keep talking for thirty minutes straight. During that time, Kurisu hardly says a word.
Rintaro: ...It's all my fault.
UNSPOKEN: Talking to Kurisu lets me sort out everything I've done. Everything I've seen.
Rintaro: I shouldn't have told Daru to hack SERN. I shouldn't have asked you to build a time machine. I shouldn't have made Moeka a lab mem. Mayuri's death... is all my fault.
UNSPOKEN: That's why I needed to bear the burden myself.  I was resolved to do whatever it took to save Mayuri, never faltering, never giving up. And yet, my resolve has already crumbled.
Kurisu: If you know that Mayuri's going to die, then what are you doing wasting time here?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's tone is haughty. Is this how I sound when I'm playing Hououin Kyouma?
Rintaro: ...I just don't get it anymore.
Kurisu: What don't you get?
Rintaro: How to save Mayuri.
Kurisu: Based on what you said, I guess the chronology protection conjecture is true.
Rintaro: No matter what I do, Mayuri dies.
Kurisu: And that's why you keep time leaping... There's no guarantee that the machine is safe, you know.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu lowers her gaze and cups her chin, as she often does when assessing a problem.
Kurisu: Even if the machine works perfectly, repeated use may have serious side effects. For example, you may become disconnected from causality itself. You need to understand the risks if you're going to continue.
Rintaro: Disconnected from causality, meaning?
Kurisu: It happens all the time in sci-fi. You'll become trapped in a closed time loop, never aging, never dying, but doomed to repeat the same day for all eternity. Worst case, you may cease to exist entirely.
UNSPOKEN: What?
Kurisu: Every trace of your existence will vanish. Nobody will remember you, because your life will have never happened. Leaping through time is that dangerous.
Rintaro: 'Humans are temporal beings.'
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks surprised.
Kurisu: Heidegger. I was thinking of that quote too.
Rintaro: I heard it from you first.
Kurisu: When?
Rintaro: This isn't the first time I've leaped.
Kurisu: Right. Of course.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu squats next to me, thinking deeply.
Kurisu: If what you said is true, then I want to save Mayuri too. But as the co-creator of the Time Leap Machine, I can't recommend its continued use. Will you listen to my advice?
