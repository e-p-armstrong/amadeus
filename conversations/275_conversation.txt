Kurisu: "Are you trying to break the machine? You don’t have to break it, Okabe. We already decided not to experiment. Remember? Anyway, put the chair down."
UNSPOKEN: I lower the chair slowly. Not because Kurisu told me to, but because I realized what would happen if I really did break the machine. It caused -- or will cause -- Mayuri’s death, but at the same time, it is also my only chance of averting that future. If I lose it, I lose my only hope of saving her. The fear of that outcome stayed my hand.
Kurisu: "You look pale. What’s wrong? Are you listening?"
UNSPOKEN: I can’t deal with this. Not now.
Kurisu: "W-wait!"
UNSPOKEN: I flee from the lab. I don’t have a particular destination in mind. People look at me strangely as I shuffle down the street. I imagine I must look like I crawled up from the grave. Soon, I get fed up with the crowd around the station and escape to the pedestrian overpass. I get about halfway across the bridge and squat down on the concrete. The giant screen on the UPX building is advertising some gothic punk band. The ticker at the bottom displays today’s weather forecast along with the date and time. I realize that today is Friday the 13th. Is there no way to get through today without Mayuri dying? It’s already 5:30. Two hours until the attack. The lights around Akihabara Station turn on one by one as the sun sets. The moe might be gone from Akiba, but the area around the station is still as posh as ever. I don’t belong here. The bridge I’m sitting on has become a date spot for couples. I see them standing here and there, gazing at the cityscape with their arms wound around each other. Somehow, they never seem to tire of the dull, unchanging scenery. What am I doing here? Mayuri’s about to die.
Kurisu: "Hey. Don’t you think you’re a little old to be sitting on the ground in public?"
UNSPOKEN: I lift my head and see Kurisu standing there.
Kurisu: "So this is where you went. I’ve been looking for you."
Rintaro: "...Christina."
Kurisu: "What?"
Rintaro: "What time is it now?"
Kurisu: "5:38. Hey. If you have time to sit around, then you can help me with the shopping."
UNSPOKEN: Shopping... Oh, right. Preparations for the party. In the original timeline, I went shopping with Kurisu at the UPX supermarket. And then we talked on this bridge, just like now. It feels like so long ago. Back then, I had no idea what was about to happen.
Kurisu: "Well? Are you going to come along or not?"
UNSPOKEN: I sigh deeply. I don’t believe that it was wrong to time leap. However...
Rintaro: "Kurisu."
UNSPOKEN: I keep my eyes lowered.
Kurisu: "...That’s the first time you’ve said my name properly."
UNSPOKEN: I feel her eyes on me.
Rintaro: "...Help me."
