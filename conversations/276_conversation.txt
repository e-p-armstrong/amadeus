Kurisu: The many-worlds interpretation... That might have something to do with how Mayuri's means of death keeps changing. But it's supposed to be impossible for parallel worlds to observe each other. Why are you different?
Rintaro: Because of my esper power, Reading Steiner.
Kurisu: This is no time for your chuunibyou nonsense.
Rintaro: ...There's no other explanation.
Kurisu: You've mentioned that Reading Steiner thing before. Were you actually serious?
Rintaro: Why would I make up something like that?
UNSPOKEN: Our D-Mail experiments proved that I can somehow perceive changes in the timeline when they occur. It's an ability only I seem to possess.
Kurisu: I don't know, but I don't want to rely on something that may not even exist. Anyway, you can't control which possibilities you observe. Even if the many-worlds interpretation holds true, it's unreasonable to expect that you'll ever find a world where Mayuri doesn't die.
Rintaro: Wait. We're not getting anywhere. Instead of analyzing what I've done, let's think about what we can do.
Kurisu: Time leaping won't change the result. I just said that.
Rintaro: Then what do we do!?
Kurisu: Calm down.
Rintaro: How can I calm down!? Do you know how many times I've seen Mayuri die!? Covered in blood! Gasping for breath! The light fading from her eyes! Again... and again... and again... And all I could do... was watch!
UNSPOKEN: I hear my teeth grinding in my skull. Recalling that despair, that feeling of utter powerlessness, makes me want to lash out at everything within reach.
Kurisu: Getting emotional won't solve anything.
Rintaro: You're only calm because you weren't there!
Kurisu: ...True. I don't know what happens five hours from now. To be honest, it doesn't feel real at all. But it's not like I don't believe you. You have to stay strong, Okabe.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu pats my arm. Her hand is warm and her touch is gentle. How... American of her.
Rintaro: ...Sorry.
UNSPOKEN: She's right. Getting emotional won't solve anything. I need to calm down. Calm down...
Rintaro: What I don't understand is how the cause can change but the effect can stay the same. It's like causality itself is broken.
Kurisu: Maybe Kiryu Moeka shooting her isn't the real cause of her death. Maybe it's something larger and less obvious. For example, maybe she dies because we invented a time machine, or because SERN discovered our hacking. If that's the cause, then it doesn't really matter how she dies. Causality remains intact.
Rintaro: Can that theory explain why Nae pushed her in front of a train?
Kurisu: Oh, right... hmm... Anyway, the principle of causality is absolute. Deny that, and you deny all of physics. There must be a distinct cause for Mayuri's death.
Rintaro: So if we figure out what it is, then maybe we can save her.
Kurisu: Not necessarily.
Rintaro: What do you mean?
Kurisu: The problem is when the causal event occurred. If it happened too far in the past... then there's nothing we can do.
Rintaro: But I can travel to any time I had a cell phone, can't I!?
