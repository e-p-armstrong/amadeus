UNSPOKEN: I can’t do it alone. I know that now.
Rintaro: "I need your help. I have to save Mayuri! I can’t do it alone, but together, we might have a chance. I want... I need to believe that! Please, lend me your strength."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu sighs.
Kurisu: "You’re such a stubborn fool. What you’ve been through... I’m surprised it hasn’t broken you already."
UNSPOKEN: Incredibly, she sounds concerned about me. She looks at me for a moment, then turns away as if embarrassed.
Kurisu: "I’ll help. Mayuri’s my friend, and a fellow lab mem. And besides... I don’t want to see you in such pain."
Rintaro: "I’m sorry."
Kurisu: "Don’t apologize. Remember when I told you about my father? You really helped me out back then. Now it’s my turn to return the favor. I want to be your strength. Besides, you still have to come with me to Aomori."
UNSPOKEN: She smiles a wry but gentle smile, as if I were her mischievous younger brother.
Kurisu: "I know you’re going to leap no matter what I say. You are a mad scientist, after all, and mad scientists play by their own rules. Hey. Aren’t you supposed to go ’muhahahaha’ or something?"
Rintaro: "Yeah..."
Kurisu: "Why do I even try?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu is right. I’ll do anything to save Mayuri.
Kurisu: "Anyway, I’m not doing this for you, okay? I’m doing it for Mayuri."
Rintaro: "Yeah, of course."
Kurisu: "That, and I think you’ll make a good test subject."
Rintaro: "Now you’re talking like SERN."
Kurisu: "It’s completely different."
Rintaro: "How so?"
Kurisu: "I only experiment on you. Besides, mad scientists experiment on themselves all the time, don’t they?"
Rintaro: "I guess..."
UNSPOKEN: I’m no longer afraid to time leap. I’ll do anything to save Mayuri.
Kurisu: "I-it’s just a joke. Don’t take it so seriously."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu stands up and looks at her watch.
Kurisu: "There’s not much time. I think you should have a clear plan before trying to change the future again."
Rintaro: "Meaning?"
Kurisu: "Leap to an even earlier time. Then explain the situation to me again."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu’s right. My actions so far have been almost entirely random, and look where that’s gotten me. I need a real plan if I’m going to save Mayuri.
Kurisu: "Let’s go."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu stretches out her hand. I grasp it and pull myself up. Mayuri and Daru are already back when we return to the lab. Suzuha is there too. To get rid of them, Kurisu and I explain that we forgot to do the shopping, so could they please take care of it for us? I have to cough up the money to convince them to go, but it works.
Kurisu: "I understand why you can’t tell Mayuri, but why can’t you tell Hashida?"
Rintaro: "I’ll tell him when it’s necessary."
