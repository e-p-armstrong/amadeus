Rintaro: "In a few seconds, it won’t have happened."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu hands me the headgear and I put it on.
Kurisu: "I see. That’s how it looks from your perspective. What does it look like from my perspective? What happens here after you leap?"
Rintaro: "...You’ll know soon enough."
UNSPOKEN: My consciousness travels to the past. That, I know from experience. But what about the body I leave behind? If time is a straight line, then it’s likely that the present will be reconstructed based on my actions in the past. But if the many-worlds interpretation holds, then after I leave, this world will continue on as if nothing happened. I used to be so fascinated by the structure of the universe, but now I don’t really care. All that matters is saving Mayuri. Kurisu’s fingers stop typing on the keyboard.
Rintaro: "What’s wrong?"
Kurisu: "It’s nothing. I was just thinking."
Rintaro: "Maybe it works like a D-Mail."
UNSPOKEN: The instant we send a D-Mail, the present changes around us. Thanks to Reading Steiner, only I remember what it was like before the change.
Kurisu: "That would make things easier, though I kind of hope you’re wrong."
Rintaro: "Because you can’t collect data if you can’t record the change?"
Kurisu: "Exactly."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu nods and begins tinkering with the settings again.
Kurisu: "I set the destination to five hours ago. You should arrive around 1:40 PM. I completed the Time Leap Machine just after 2. Do you remember?"
UNSPOKEN: Barely. For Kurisu, that happened only five hours ago. For me, it feels like weeks.  Maybe it has been weeks.
Kurisu: "Nobody likes a man who can’t remember dates. Be thankful that I make a habit of checking the time. I have a pretty good idea what happened when."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu finishes typing and turns to face me.
Kurisu: "Listen, Okabe. If you’re going to keep using the Time Leap Machine, there’s one thing you must remember. Don’t let go of your phone. Ever. It’s your lifeline. Your destination marker. As long as you keep it with you, you can leap to any time you want. But if you lose your phone... if someone else gets ahold of it..."
UNSPOKEN: Then if I leap to that time, my memories could overwrite theirs. I don’t want to imagine what might happen next.
Kurisu: "If it breaks, or the battery dies..."
UNSPOKEN: Then I won’t be able to leap to that time. If it breaks, then I can get a new phone with the same number, but there will still be a period of time to which I can never leap.
Kurisu: "The time leap will fail. Once again, never let go of your phone."
Rintaro: "Got it."
Kurisu: "After you leap back to this afternoon, just sit tight and don’t do anything until I complete the Time Leap Machine. If you accidentally prevent me from completing the machine, it will likely wreak havoc with the timeline. As soon as I finish, declare that we will not experiment. Then send everyone home. Ask me to stay. Tell me the truth. If you say you came from the future, I’ll probably believe you."
