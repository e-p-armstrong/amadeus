UNSPOKEN: 48 hours... I can only go back two days!?
Rintaro: Why didn't you tell me that before!?
Kurisu: Before what? I just finished the Time Leap Machine, remember?
UNSPOKEN: That's true...
Rintaro: Future you didn't say anything about it either.
Kurisu: Oh, so that's what you mean. Maybe she just didn't have the chance.
Rintaro: So how come I can only leap 48 hours?
Kurisu: I don't know. Even I don't understand everything that's going on inside that thing. But you can do consecutive leaps. That is, as long as the Time Leap Machine exists. For example, if the Time Leap Machine remains functional for ten straight years, you could leap back to this moment ten years from now. Of course, it would take a total of 1825 leaps, so I don't recommend it. Still, it's theoretically possible.
Rintaro: Then what's the problem?
Kurisu: Weren't you listening? I said, as long as the Time Leap Machine exists. When was the machine completed?
Rintaro: ...Ah.
Kurisu: Exactly. An hour ago. August 13th, 2010. 2:00 PM, or thereabouts. It didn't exist before then. It's impossible to use the machine before 2 PM today.
Rintaro: So what you're saying is...
UNSPOKEN: Count 48 hours back.
Rintaro: I can't go back farther than 2 PM on the 11th!?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu nods, her expression grave.
Kurisu: Most likely.
Rintaro: Can't you improve it!?
Kurisu: Eventually, maybe, but certainly not now. I'd need a real laboratory with real equipment. It would be expensive, which means we'd need sponsors. And if we go looking, I'm pretty sure SERN would crush us. I'd say that's proven by the fact that neither you nor I have leapt here from the far future yet.
UNSPOKEN: So basically...
Rintaro: We can't do anything!? Even with the Time Leap Machine, we can't stop SERN from killing Mayuri five hours from now!?
UNSPOKEN: At that moment, I hear a sound from outside the window. What? Is it Moeka!? Did she overhear us!? I dash to the window and look down at the street. It's Suzuha. Her bicycle has fallen over, and she's scurrying to pick it up. Our eyes meet.
Rintaro: ...Huh?
UNSPOKEN: Why does she look so pale? Her lips move slightly. It looks like she's whispering something, but I can't make it out from here.
Rintaro: Hey!
