Kurisu: "Who knows me better than myself?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu grins faintly and stands up after she’s done typing.
Kurisu: "Don’t forget. It was my mad skillz that turned the PhoneWave into a time leap machine. When you told me about your time leap, I took it as proof that my theories were right. I was happy it succeeded. I really was. I didn’t doubt it was true for a second."
UNSPOKEN: I see...
Kurisu: "Just to be safe, I should probably give you a passphrase. What I want the most right now is my own fork."
Rintaro: "...What?"
Kurisu: "It doesn’t mean anything, okay!?"
Rintaro: "You want your own fork?"
Kurisu: "I already have my own spoon... wait, that doesn’t matter! Everything’s ready! Now get out of here!"
UNSPOKEN: I nod and call up the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Kurisu: "Be careful. And remember... I’m always on your side."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu touches my shoulder, then steps away. I lie back on the sofa with my phone in my hand. Needles in my brain. A whining in my ears. These sensations never get any easier to endure. I look at the clock. It’s about 1:45. There’s a high-school baseball game on TV. In about fifteen minutes, Kurisu will finish the Time Leap Machine. All it needs are some final adjustments, so there’s nothing for me to do but wait. As the pain in my brain subsides, I realize that my head is throbbing. Why? Oh, I remember. Right before this, I had an argument with Mister Braun in which he introduced his fist to my skull. Mayuri is at her sewing machine, working on her costume. Daru is at his computer, collecting moe artwork from the internet. Kurisu is in the development room, upgrading the Time Leap Machine. I sit, motionless, as the minutes tick by. Suddenly, the sound of the sewing machine stops.
Mayuri: "Okarin, Okarin! Can you come here?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri shows me her costume.
Mayuri: "Can you hold this for me? Spread it out like ’fwapp!’"
Itaru: "Mayu-shi, say ’fwapp’ again."
Mayuri: "Fwapp!"
Itaru: "I got a fwapp!"
Kurisu: "Stop it, perv."
UNSPOKEN: I follow Mayuri’s directions and spread the costume out by the sleeves.
Mayuri: "Hmm... Okay! Thanks."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri looks a little tired. She was working on this costume all night. But then she smiles, brighter than the sun.
Mayuri: "All done♪"
UNSPOKEN: ...I said something here, didn’t I? What was it? I can’t remember.
Mayuri: "I finished before Chris-chan! We were racing."
Kurisu: "You win, Mayuri. Congratulations. But I’m finished too."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu finishes connecting the two cords she’s holding.
Kurisu: "Complete."
UNSPOKEN: Alright, that’s my cue.
Rintaro: "We’re not experimenting."
Kurisu: "Eh!?"
UNSPOKEN: Crap, was that too soon?
Kurisu: "I just finished and you’re already shutting it down? What I have been doing these past three days?"
Rintaro: "Time leaping presents a host of problems. I want to consider them all carefully."
