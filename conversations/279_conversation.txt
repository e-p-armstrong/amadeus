UNSPOKEN: What is she trying to do? What is that satellite? How is it related to John Titor? Is it even a satellite? Nobody knows for sure. I checked online. No satellites fell out of orbit that day. When they do, whether by accident or design, they usually burn up in the atmosphere. It's impossible for one to land in such perfect condition. So what is it, then? A jolt suddenly runs through my body. Could it be... a time machine!? There's only one way to know for sure. I need to get there before Suzuha does something! The elevator and escalator aren't operating, so I bound up the stairs two at a time. My lungs gasp and my legs burn, but I force my body to carry me to the top. There's the satellite, lodged in Radi-Kan's roof. I notice wires holding it in place. The police must have done that so it wouldn't fall. There's a hatch open on the side of the machine. I see someone moving inside.
Rintaro: Suzuha!!
UNSPOKEN: The person freezes when I shout. I run to the satellite.
Suzuha: Okabe Rintaro...
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha turns to me with a sad expression. Behind her, I can see the interior of the satellite. It's surprisingly simple, without the switches and buttons you'd expect. Instead, there's a black box the size of a desktop PC. There are numbers on the screen -- 2010. 08. 13, and below that, 1975. 08. 13. Suzuha reaches out to press a button.
Suzuha: Ow!!
UNSPOKEN: Sparks burst from the panel. She jerks back, her fingertips burned.
Rintaro: What are you doing!?
Suzuha: ...It's not working.
Rintaro: You know how to use that thing?
UNSPOKEN: She doesn't reply. I see her shoulders sag.
Suzuha: It's not working...
UNSPOKEN: Those sparks had to be from an electrical short. My eyes are burning from the smoke.
Rintaro: Answer me, Amane Suzuha.
UNSPOKEN: I swallow hard, then ask the question.
Rintaro: This is a time machine, isn't it? Are you a time traveler?
UNSPOKEN: With her head hung low, Suzuha nods.
Suzuha: I'm... John Titor.
UNSPOKEN: There's still a big crowd outside, so we exit the building on the side facing away from the station. Suzuha has calmed down a bit, so I start pressing her for answers.
Rintaro: What do you mean, you're John Titor?
Suzuha: ...Exactly what it sounds like. I'm the John Titor who's been posting on @channel.
Rintaro: ...I thought he was a guy.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha smiles humorlessly.
Suzuha: I fooled you? Guess my camouflage worked, then.
Rintaro: Who are you hiding from?
Suzuha: ...SERN.
Rintaro: Those stories you posted... were they...
Suzuha: True? Mostly. A few exceptions.
UNSPOKEN: It's those exceptions that bother me.
Rintaro: So you came from 2036, and that satellite... that's your time machine.
Suzuha: I was hoping you wouldn't find out, but my time machine went and broke on me. I really screwed up, huh?
