Suzuha: Chevy? That's a car, right? Where'd you hear that?
Rintaro: The Titor in 2000 said so.
Suzuha: 2000? That might be me on a different worldline. At least, I haven't been to 2000. I came straight here from 2036.
UNSPOKEN: So it was someone else? It's true that Titor never posted in 2000, not on the current worldline. It doesn't matter. I can worry about that later.
Rintaro: What do you know?
UNSPOKEN: I press Suzuha for answers, trapping her between me and the wall so she can't escape.
Rintaro: You overheard my conversation with Kurisu, right? Why did you run to the time machine? What were you trying to do?
Suzuha: I thought it was my fault.
Rintaro: What?
Suzuha: Because I neglected my mission, SERN was able to put their plan in motion. ...Is it true!?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha suddenly grabs my shoulders.
Suzuha: Is it true that SERN kills Shiina Mayuri?
Rintaro: It's true. I time leaped from five hours in the future.
Suzuha: Time leaped... So you guys completed your time machine...
Rintaro: I need answers! What do you mean it's your fault!?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha bites her lip and looks away.
Suzuha: I'll tell you everything. I think you need to know. You... and Makise Kurisu.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu? Why Kurisu? I'll guess I'll find out if I let Suzuha talk. We should head back to the lab. But first... I offer Suzuha my handkerchief. She looks at me for a second, then takes it and ties it around her burned hand.
Suzuha: ...Thanks.
UNSPOKEN: She should probably see a doctor about her hand, but there's no time for that. Mayuri's death is approaching. I just hope she's not in too much pain. I wrap a towel around her hand to keep people around us from staring.
Mayuri: Welcome back, Okarin! Oh! Suzu-san's with you too♪
UNSPOKEN: When we get to the lab, Mayuri and Daru are there for some reason. I thought I sent them home! Mayuri gives me a ditzy answer when I ask them.
Mayuri: I really thought we should celebrate the birth of Super PhoneWave-chan! So Daru-kun and I went shopping♪
UNSPOKEN: I should have known she wouldn't stay away. Kurisu looks as worried as I am. She leans close and whispers into my ear.
Kurisu: W-what do we do?
Rintaro: Make absolutely sure Mayuri doesn't find out.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu nods slightly.
Itaru: What are you guys whispering about?
Kurisu: Um...
Rintaro: How many times do I have to say it? No party!
Mayuri: Come on, Okarin. That's no fun!
Rintaro: It's not about fun.
UNSPOKEN: I glance at Suzuha. She's still looks depressed.
Mayuri: Suzu-san? Are you feeling okay?
Rintaro: Suzuha, Christina, and I have important matters to discuss. That's why I asked you to leave for the day.
Mayuri: Mayushii wants to hear too!
Itaru: Um, I think he's serious.
Mayuri: But Suzu-san looks sad... Mayushii's worried...
