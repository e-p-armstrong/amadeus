UNSPOKEN: Suzuha glares at Kurisu.
Suzuha: In 2036, you're apotheosized as the mother of the time machine.
Kurisu: Apotheosized?
Itaru: In Japanese, please.
Suzuha: Apotheosized. As in revered, respected.
UNSPOKEN: She keeps using unusual vocabulary. Or maybe that's normal vocabulary in 2036?
Kurisu: Respected? Huh!? I-I am!?
Suzuha: In 2010, you pioneer time leap technology. Afterwards, you contribute to the development of SERN's time machine. That's what I know about Makise Kurisu.
UNSPOKEN: Is that why she treats Kurisu like an enemy?
Rintaro: Then I must be the father of the time machine, right?
Suzuha: Okabe Rintaro is a terrorist in 2036. You're pretty infamous.
Rintaro: Wha...
UNSPOKEN: Seriously? I'm a terrorist in the future!?
Kurisu: I help SERN build their time machine? I don't believe it. SERN experiments on people against their will. They're a disgrace to scientists everywhere. I would never collaborate with them.
Suzuha: But that's how it is in the future.
Kurisu: How did the future me explain herself?
Suzuha: We've never met. By 2036, you're already dead... sorry.
Kurisu: Well... that's just great. I don't even make it to fifty?
Suzuha: In my time, there are two kinds of people: those who live extremely long lives, and those who die young, under suspicious circumstances. People who act against SERN are erased.
Kurisu: T-they erased me?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha looks into Kurisu's eyes. For once, she's not glaring at Kurisu.
Suzuha: ...Maybe you were being used by SERN too. Maybe they took your parents hostage and forced you to work on their time machine.
Kurisu: No... does that mean Mama's in danger?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's mother is in America. It's not terribly difficult to imagine SERN kidnapping her while Kurisu is away. After all, I watched Moeka kill Mayuri in cold blood.
Rintaro: Rounders.
Itaru: What's that?
Rintaro: SERN's private army. Or something like that.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha nods.
Suzuha: On paper, they're an independent technology research firm. In reality, they do the dirty work for SERN all over the world.
UNSPOKEN: According to Moeka, they have two chief duties. First, to acquire IBN 5100s, the only computers that can access SERN's secret database. Second, to find promising scientists in the field of time travel and force them to cooperate with SERN, or eliminate them if they will not.
Suzuha: So they already exist. I thought they might. In my time, they're our number one enemy.
Itaru: D-dirty work? Does that mean like... kidnappings and assassinations?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha looks to me with a question in her eyes. I shake my head.
Suzuha: In my time, yes. But I don't think they've reached that level in this time yet.
UNSPOKEN: Daru is visibly relieved.
Kurisu: Amane-san. You said that most of what you posted as John Titor was true, right?
