UNSPOKEN: I know I don’t have much chance of catching her on foot, but I have to try. There’s something going on here. This is a completely new sequence of events. According to my memories of the future, Suzuha is supposed to remain at the Braun Tube Workshop until 6:30 this evening. But when she overheard me talking to Kurisu, she suddenly took off like a bat out of hell. This has to mean something. Suzuha’s already out of sight, but when she left, she was headed for Chuo-dori. I wonder if her phone’s on. Maybe I should just try calling her. Come to think of it, this reminds me of something. On the day she failed to meet her father, she disappeared without a word -- just an email saying bye. I searched the town, but I couldn’t find her, so I sent a D-Mail that changed the past in order to make her stay. I’m pretty sure I lost her near the station back then. What happened on that timeline? Where did Suzuha go after failing to find her father?
Rintaro: "Suzuha! I need to talk to you!"
Suzuha: "...I’m sorry. It’s all my fault."
Rintaro: "...What?"
Suzuha: "All because I acted like a spoiled child. This time, I’m going. Bye."
Rintaro: "Hey! Suzuha! Wait!"
UNSPOKEN: It’s happening again. She’s going to disappear. Last time, I lost sight of her near the station. I search up and down Chuo-dori, but find no trace of Suzuha or her bike. I have to be careful. There could already be Rounders here in Akiba. I comb the area around the station’s main exit, but there’s no sign of her anywhere. I lost sight of her here before, so I thought she might be close by. Maybe I should corner her on my next time leap, press her for answers before she can escape. I’d better get back to the lab. I start walking away from the station, but just then-- The people around me gasp and point. Everyone’s looking up at the sky. No, not the sky. The satellite embedded in the roof of Radi-Kan. Why now? It’s been there for two weeks. It’s practically a landmark now. But everyone looks like they’re seeing it for the first time. So I turn and look up too.
Rintaro: "Wha..."
UNSPOKEN: The lights on the satellite are blinking. Is someone inside? Who?
Rintaro: "Suzuha? Or could it be Moeka!?"
