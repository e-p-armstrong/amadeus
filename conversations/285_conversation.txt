Kurisu: Just ignore them.
UNSPOKEN: Let me get this straight. The reason I can't save Mayuri... is that her death is the event upon which this attractor field converges? But that means... That means the world really is killing Mayuri.
Itaru: But then, isn't it impossible to change the future? It always converges in the end, right? No matter what you do, the result is the same.
UNSPOKEN: That's right. That's why Mayuri dies no matter how many times I leap.
Suzuha: We have to escape Attractor Field Alpha.
Rintaro: Escape?
Suzuha: In other words, we're going to jump to a worldline in Attractor Field Beta.
Kurisu: I thought attractor fields couldn't interact.
Suzuha: Attractor fields are normally separate, but if we go to the instant they diverge...
Kurisu: The instant they diverge... is that now?
Suzuha: I was taught that a major divergence occurs in 2010. This year, an earth-shattering event causes divergence at the attractor field level. The last time such a divergence occurred was in the year 2000, and before that, in 1991.
Mayuri: Umm, what happened those years?
Suzuha: Events that changed the face of the world.
Mayuri: Huh?
Rintaro: 1991 was the collapse of the Soviet Union, right? But what happened in 2000? 2001 had the 9/11 attacks...
Suzuha: The Year 2000 Problem.
Itaru: Y2K? But that was just hype. Nothing happened.
Suzuha: That's because the Alpha worldline we're on represents a world where Y2K didn't occur.
UNSPOKEN: So in other words, there are worlds where it did occur?
Suzuha: And that brings us to 2010.
Mayuri: Did something big happen this year?
Suzuha: What else could it be...
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha looks towards the development room.
Suzuha: But the creation of humanity's first time machine?
Mayuri: Oh yeah! Wow!
Kurisu: One more question.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu keeps plowing ahead. I guess that's what makes her a scientist.
Kurisu: These worldlines aren't parallel worlds, are they?
Suzuha: No. Ultimately, they're just possibilities that exist simultaneously.
Kurisu: Then how do you observe the differences between worldlines? Wouldn't you need a god's eye view to do that?
Suzuha: Normally. However...
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha looks at me. ...Don't tell me!
Rintaro: Reading Steiner!?
Suzuha: Is that what you call it? Okabe Rintaro, you have the power to observe changes across worldlines. Correct?
Rintaro: Yeah.
Suzuha: That's the key. Your power is the key to freeing the world from SERN's rule. You have the power of a god.
Rintaro: My power...
Suzuha: If you escape Attractor Field Alpha and reach a Beta worldline... then the result will change.
UNSPOKEN: I feel a shiver of excitement.
Rintaro: So there's hope?
UNSPOKEN: I can save Mayuri? Suzuha nods firmly. Then I must do it. I have no choice.
Kurisu: Wait a second.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu, however, is not so enthusiastic.
Kurisu: How do we know this is all true? What if Amane-san is just making stuff up?
Suzuha: What!? I'm not making stuff up!
Kurisu: Calm down. I'm not trying to pick a fight. But I still have questions. One, how do you know about Okabe's power? Two, how did you know Okabe and I were in Akihabara in 2010? Don't you know a little too much for someone born in 2017?
