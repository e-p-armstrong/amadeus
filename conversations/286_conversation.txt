Mayuri: "But Suzu-san looks sad... Mayushii’s worried..."
Suzuha: "...Sorry."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha hangs her head and bites her lip. I know she feels responsible for Mayuri’s death. But how is she related? That’s what I’m here to find out.
Suzuha: "I want Shiina Mayuri and Hashida Itaru to stay. This concerns them too."
UNSPOKEN: If Suzuha says so, then I have no objections. But I quietly pull her aside and remind her not to tell them about Mayuri’s impending death. Then I quickly explain Suzuha’s true identity -- that she posted on @channel as John Titor, that the satellite is really a time machine, that she came from the year 2036.
Itaru: "A girl from the future? That’s awesome! Can I shake your hand?"
Rintaro: "We’re not playing around here, Daru."
Mayuri: "What year were you born?"
Suzuha: "2017."
Mayuri: "That’s in seven years... You haven’t been born yet, but you’re here. Uh... huh???"
UNSPOKEN: There’s no time to deal with Mayuri’s confusion.
Rintaro: "Alright, Suzuha. Let’s hear it."
Suzuha: "Well, the gist is what I posted on @channel. I came from future, the year 2036. In my time, the world is a dystopia ruled by SERN. There’s no war, no conflict, but no freedom either."
Mayuri: "Diss-tope-ear?"
Kurisu: "A society where every activity is controlled by the government. In a dystopia, you’re not allowed to eat bananas unless today is banana-eating day. If you break that rule, they throw you in jail without a trial."
Mayuri: "That’s terrible! Mayushii loves bananas..."
UNSPOKEN: Forget about the bananas.
Suzuha: "I’m part of the Resistance fighting to free humanity from SERN’s control. I came to the past to change my present. From your point of view, I guess I should say the future. To change the future."
UNSPOKEN: Change the future... She doesn’t sound like she’s joking.
Mayuri: "Um, what about finding your father? Was that a lie?"
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha doesn’t answer. Does that mean it was a lie?
Kurisu: "SERN is a research institution. They don’t have political power. I explained that to John Titor several times online."
UNSPOKEN: ...Online?
Rintaro: "...Wait, don’t tell me. You’re ’KuriGohan and Kamehameha’!?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu turns red and looks away.
Kurisu: "Titor came forward, so it’s only fair that I do too."
Rintaro: "In that case, I’ll come clean too. I was posting under my true name, Hououin Kyou--"
Kurisu & Suzuha: "I know."
Mayuri: "Ah, you harmonized♪"
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha frowns. She must not like having anything in common with Kurisu. She clears her throat and continues.
Suzuha: "SERN is still a research institution in 2036. The world is actually ruled by SERN’s secret backers, the Committee of 300."
Rintaro: "The Committee of 300... They’re real?"
