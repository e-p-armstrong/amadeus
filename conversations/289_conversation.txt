Suzuha: Yeah, that's right.
Mayuri: Wow, a foreigner?
Suzuha: No, I'm pretty sure he's Japanese. Barrel Titor is his codename in the Resistance. I don't think he's using it yet.
UNSPOKEN: So that's why Suzuha called herself John Titor.
Suzuha: I... don't know his real name. Some daughter, huh?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha looks like she's about to cry for an instant, but she quickly covers it with a bitter smile.
Suzuha: He died before he could tell me.
UNSPOKEN: Hearing that, I realize how hellish the world she came from must be.
Rintaro: What about your surname, Amane?
Suzuha: That was my mother's maiden name.
Kurisu: So you have no leads?
Suzuha: Leads... oh, there is one thing.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha claps her hands together and starts patting her pockets. A few seconds later, she reaches into one and pulls out...
Mayuri: A pin?
UNSPOKEN: I've seen Suzuha fiddling with it before. It's just a regular pin, the kind you stick on your hat or bag.
Mayuri: There's something written on it.
UNSPOKEN: It reads OSHM***A 7010.
Suzuha: This belonged to my dad.
Kurisu: A memento...
Rintaro: Google it, Daru!
UNSPOKEN: Daru runs a search, but gets only incomprehensible foreign sites.
Suzuha: He was here in Akihabara, so I think we can exclude the foreign sites.
Itaru: Okay, got it.
UNSPOKEN: He narrows the search down to Japanese sites. But even then, none of the results look relevant.
Itaru: Nothing!
Mayuri: But this has to be some kind of hint!
UNSPOKEN: With Suzuha's permission, I take a picture of the pin.
Mayuri: Okay, all in favor of helping Suzu-san find her dad?
UNSPOKEN: I want to argue that there's no time for that, but Mayuri's right when she says that the time machine won't be ready for a while. I guess there's no harm in letting her have her way. After all, there's no point in running, not even with two days' head start. Even if I dragged Mayuri to the ends of the Earth, we wouldn't be able to escape her death. I know that now.
Rintaro: ...No objections.
Mayuri: Thanks, Okarinâ™ª Ehehe!
UNSPOKEN: Daru raises his hand in agreement. So does Kurisu. It's decided. We'll help Suzuha find her father.
Suzuha: Everyone... thank you. But I want to be clear that my mission to 1975 comes first. That was my dad's final wish, after all. So if we still haven't found him by the time repairs are complete, I think we should give up. Is that okay?
Mayuri: Are you sure?
Suzuha: If we still haven't found him by then, it just wasn't meant to be.
UNSPOKEN: It's a relief to hear Suzuha say that.
Itaru: So where do we start?
Rintaro: The pin is our only hint. We'll hit every store in Akiba that sells things like this. Maybe someone will know where it came from.
Suzuha: What kind of stores?
Rintaro: Akiba is full of niche stores where you can find strange and cool accessories.
