UNSPOKEN: She has a point. Everyone looks to Suzuha.
Suzuha: "...It was written in Dad’s will."
UNSPOKEN: His will?
Mayuri: "What do you mean?"
Suzuha: "His will was what made me decide to time travel. My dad was one of the founding members of the Resistance. He hid from SERN and researched time travel on his own. He wanted to change the future. But SERN killed him. That’s why I’m here. To fulfill his dream."
Kurisu: "...I’m sorry."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha doesn’t look at Kurisu. She still seems to have a grudge against her. Kurisu would never actively cooperate with SERN. I know that, but I just can’t say it in front of Suzuha. For some reason, Suzuha really does see Kurisu as responsible for the problems of the future. But if that’s the case, why doesn’t Suzuha just kill Kurisu? Wouldn’t that change the future too? Maybe she can’t. Worldlines converge. No matter how hard I struggle, Mayuri dies. Similarly, it may be impossible for Suzuha to kill Kurisu... no matter how much she may want to. Suzuha clears her throat as if to change the subject.
Suzuha: "Akihabara, 2010. The time machine created here accelerates SERN’s own time machine research. We have to stop that from happening in order to guide history in a new direction."
Itaru: "Stop it? How?"
Rintaro: "SERN already knows about us."
UNSPOKEN: That’s clear from Moeka’s attack.
Suzuha: "Dad believed that the ultimate cause was the very first email you sent with your time machine."
Rintaro: "An email? It wasn’t because they caught us hacking?"
Itaru: "Like I said, nobody can catch my hacking."
Kurisu: "Which email are you talking about?"
Mayuri: "Um, I know! Wasn’t it the email Okarin sent that said Chris-chan died?"
UNSPOKEN: Right. The email I sent to Daru right after Doctor Nakabachi’s conference.
Kurisu: "Oh, that..."
UNSPOKEN: Back then, we hadn’t yet realized that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) was a time machine.
Suzuha: "SERN probably intercepted that email and realized what it meant."
Rintaro: "They were already on to us back then?"
UNSPOKEN: Come to think of it, the first time I met Moeka was the day after I sent that email.
Itaru: "We really jumped in the deep end, huh..."
Mayuri: "Mayushii’s good at the breaststroke!"
Itaru: "Alright, then do a sexy underwater pose."
Rintaro: "But how did they intercept our email? Hundreds of millions of emails are sent around the world each day."
Suzuha: "SERN uses the Echelon network to collect communications pertaining to time travel research worldwide."
Rintaro: "Echelon!? It really exists!?"
UNSPOKEN: As an expert on conspiracies, I understand the implications, and they terrify me. No one else seems to get what Suzuha’s saying, though.
Suzuha: "Echelon sees everything. Any transmission that even hints at time travel is filtered and sent to SERN."
UNSPOKEN: For example, an email that appeared to have come from the future.
Suzuha: "We need to find the record of that email in SERN’s database and delete it. If you do that, then SERN will never know you exist. Their time machine won’t be completed in 2034. If we’re lucky, the program may be shut down entirely."
