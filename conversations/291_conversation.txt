Itaru: "Hmm... there wasn’t any data like that when we hacked SERN’s database."
Suzuha: "The IBN 5100."
Itaru: "Oh!"
Rintaro: "Of course! SERN’s IBN 5100 database!"
Suzuha: "That’s probably where they store the data from Echelon."
UNSPOKEN: So that’s what it is!
Rintaro: "Dammit, Daru! Why didn’t we use the IBN 5100 earlier!?"
Itaru: "Uh... we never had one?"
Rintaro: "What are you talking about!? I got one, remember!?"
Itaru: "Huh?"
UNSPOKEN: Right... That was on a different worldline. On this worldline, I never found the IBN 5100.
Suzuha: "My mission is to make sure you acquire an IBN 5100."
Rintaro: "You have one!?"
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha shakes her head.
Suzuha: "I’m going to 1975 to obtain one."
UNSPOKEN: 1975. The year the IBN 5100 went to market. I know because the John Titor in 2000 said that was his mission. Was that John Titor Suzuha too? Anyway, if Suzuha can get us an IBN 5100, then we can leave this attractor field and jump to a Beta worldline, where SERN never finds us and their time machine is never completed. Mayuri won’t have to die.
Rintaro: "Alright! We need to move fast. How soon can you leave, Suzuha?"
Suzuha: "I was trying to leave when you caught me, but..."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha bows her head apologetically. I look at her burnt hand. She’s hiding it from Mayuri and Daru, but I can see the blood staining my handkerchief. It hurts to look at. Maybe we should get her to a doctor.
Rintaro: "Right... your time machine’s broken."
Kurisu: "Can you fix it?"
Suzuha: "No. I just ride it. My dad’s the one who built it. I’ve memorized the manual, so I know how it works, but..."
UNSPOKEN: That doesn’t mean she knows how to repair it, and there’s no guarantee that a time machine from 2036 can be repaired with today’s technology.
Kurisu: "Maybe we can use the Time Leap Machine to go back before Amane-san’s time machine broke."
Itaru: "Wait, you’re going to use the Time Leap Machine? Wasn’t the plan not to experiment?"
UNSPOKEN: I still haven’t told Daru about my time leaping. There’s no time to explain.
Rintaro: "We’ll use it if the situation demands. Do you know when it broke, Suzuha?"
Suzuha: "No... but it was probably the rain a few days ago. It’s supposed to be airtight, but the inside was all wet when I checked it today."
Itaru: "Maybe it made a hole when you crashed into Radi-Kan?"
Suzuha: "That wasn’t a crash. The coordinates were slightly off, so it just appeared there. It’s not exactly the most stable machine."
Rintaro: "Anyone remember when it rained?"
Kurisu: "The morning of the 10th. Just before dawn."
