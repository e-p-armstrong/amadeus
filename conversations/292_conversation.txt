Kurisu: He hasn't come back yet. It's already dark, so maybe he went straight home?
UNSPOKEN: It's too dark to work at Radi-Kan now. We can't use lights, because that would be too conspicuous to the people below.  Mayuri isn't around. Is she making any progress in the search for Suzuha's father?
Suzuha: I feel bad. There's no time for this...
Rintaro: It's not for you. We're doing it to save Mayuri.
Suzuha: ...Yeah.
UNSPOKEN: I start up Daru's computer and search the net for communities of people who collect unique pins. I'll investigate tomorrow based on the information I find. There's a pin collecting group on a site called FrePara, where everyone shows off their collections. I post there, asking for information. I'm sleeping on the couch when a loud alarm rings in my ears.
Rintaro: Is it SERN!?
UNSPOKEN: I jump up and see Kurisu and Suzuha. Kurisu is holding her phone. That's the source of the sound.
Kurisu: Good morning.
UNSPOKEN: Her sour expression says it's not good at all. I wish she'd put herself in my shoes and see what it's like to be woken up suddenly like that. I check the time on my phone. It's just before 7 AM.
Rintaro: ...You came to wake me up? Thanks.
Kurisu: I didn't do it for you.
Suzuha: I asked her to wake you up, Okabe Rintaro. There's something I want to show you.
UNSPOKEN: I realize that there's a strange object sitting on the table in front of me.
Rintaro: ...What's this?
Suzuha: A divergence meter. The numbers indicate the divergence value of the current worldline.
UNSPOKEN: The meter displays 0. 337187%.
Suzuha: Divergence is measured from my original worldline, which corresponds to zero.
Rintaro: You made this?
Suzuha: No. I brought it with me from 2036.
Rintaro: These are Nixie tubes, right? Whoever made this has taste. I'd happily dub it Future Gadget No. 9.
Kurisu: How exactly does it work? It shouldn't be possible to measure changes like that.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha shrugs.
Suzuha: I don't know either.
Rintaro: You don't know!?
Suzuha: Can you guess who made it?
UNSPOKEN: How should I know?
Suzuha: You did, Okabe Rintaro.
Rintaro: Huh?
Suzuha: You made it, umm... 11 years from now. It apparently works the same way your special power does.
Rintaro: Huh...
Kurisu: So this meter lets other people check worldline divergence?
Suzuha: I wish. I'm pretty sure only Okabe Rintaro would notice if the number changed.
Kurisu: What? Then there's no point. Make something useful for once, Okabe.
UNSPOKEN: I ignore Kurisu's complaints and look at the meter again. This is something I made. Fifteen years have passed since I completed it. Eleven years will pass before I complete it. It's a strange feeling.
Suzuha: Only the person who made it knows how it works. Wait 11 years. I'm sure he'll have figured it out by then.
Rintaro: Have you met me in the future?
