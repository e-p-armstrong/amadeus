UNSPOKEN: I thought we had a glimmer of hope...
Itaru: "I think we should try to fix it."
Mayuri: "Yeah! It’s a time machine, so we have plenty of time, right?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu, Suzuha, and I say nothing. We know. In less than two hours, Mayuri will die. It’s already 5:30. There’s barely enough time to sneak into Radi-Kan, let alone fix Suzuha’s time machine. Maybe I should leap now to 2 PM on the 11th. Then we’ll have two full days to fix the machine.
Rintaro: "You’re all hungry, aren’t you? You should be."
Itaru: "What’s this all of a sudden?"
Mayuri: "Mayushii’s hungry!"
UNSPOKEN: As expected from a glutton. I take a 10, 000 yen bill out of my wallet.
Rintaro: "Mayuri, Daru. I leave the shopping to you. We can come up with a plan while we eat."
Mayuri: "Wow, Okarin! What are we going to do with all this money?"
Rintaro: "Buy food. Lots of food. Use it all!"
Itaru: "You just calmly hand over a 10, 000 yen bill... wow, Okarin, you make it look easy! That’s why we love you! That’s why we admire you!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri and Daru leave in high spirits. I knew the 10, 000 yen bill would work.
Rintaro: "Christina. Titor."
Suzuha: "Titor? Is that me?"
Rintaro: "Who else?"
Suzuha: "Why are you calling me that now?"
Rintaro: "Because you’re the one behind Titor’s mask."
Suzuha: "Well, yeah, but..."
Kurisu: "Just give up. Okabe rarely calls anyone by their name."
Suzuha: "Oh yeah. He always calls me ’Part-Time Warrior’ for some reason."
Rintaro: "Listen, you two. I’m going to leap to 2 PM on the 11th. After Titor explains herself again, we’ll start repairs on the time machine. Our goal is to have it working by this time today."
Kurisu: "Is that the best plan?"
Rintaro: "It’s better than trying to fix it when we only have two hours left. If it doesn’t work, I’ll just keep repeating the same two days."
Suzuha: "...I’m sorry."
Rintaro: "Titor. We’re counting on you to get us an IBN 5100. Never forget. I’m not doing this for you, and I’m not doing it for the future. My mission is to save Mayuri. Call me self-righteous if you want. However... I’m doing this my way."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu and Suzuha give an encouraging nod in agreement.
Rintaro: "Good. Then let’s begin."
Kurisu: "You’re not going to name the operation?"
UNSPOKEN: Who cares about that? This isn’t a game. Mayuri’s life hangs in the balance.
Kurisu: "You couldn’t find a good Norse mythology-themed name?"
Suzuha: "Why Norse mythology?"
Kurisu: "I don’t think there’s a deep meaning behind it. Chuunibyou patients just love Germanic names for some reason."
