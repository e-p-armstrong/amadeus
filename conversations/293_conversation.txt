Kurisu: "So there’s still chuunibyou in 2036..."
Rintaro: "Cut the chatter!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri’s life hangs in the balance. There’s no time for this nonsense! Kurisu sets up the Time Leap Machine while Suzuha goes to turn on the 42-inch CRT. Well before Mayuri returns, I leap. When I come to, I’m standing with my phone in hand. While I wait for the ringing in my ears to subside, I check the date and time on my phone screen. August 11th, 2:21 PM. Alright. Now I have two more days. As a matter of fact, I leapt twice. First to 2 PM on the 13th, when the machine was completed. From there, I leapt an additional 48 hours to 2 PM on the 11th. It was my first consecutive leap, but it seems to have gone well. I immediately head downstairs to see Suzuha. I’m relieved to see that her hand isn’t burned. When I explain the situation, Suzuha races to Radi-Kan to confirm my story.  After she realizes that I’m telling the truth, I take her back to the lab and have her repeat the explanation she gave us before I time leaped. We come to the conclusion that all we can do right now is try our best to repair Suzuha’s time machine.
Itaru: "Let’s go take a look!"
UNSPOKEN: Daru is unusually enthusiastic. I guess Suzuha’s talk of attractor fields and divergence and correcting history’s mistakes got his blood pumping.
Mayuri: "H-hold on, everyone!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri stops us as we’re about to leave the lab.
Mayuri: "Um, guys? Aren’t we forgetting something?"
Itaru: "Like what?"
Mayuri: "What about Suzu-san’s dad?"
UNSPOKEN: Oh, right. I thought Suzuha was lying about that. But when I turn to her, she looks away.
Suzuha: "...That doesn’t matter now, does it?"
Mayuri: "It does too! I mean, it’ll take time to fix the time machine, won’t it? We should help Suzu-san find her dad in the meantime! Right?"
Rintaro: "But..."
UNSPOKEN: When I show reluctance, Mayuri’s puffs out her cheeks.
Mayuri: "Don’t be like that, Okarin! You have to keep your promise."
UNSPOKEN: What promise?
Mayuri: "We promised, remember? We said we’d all look for Suzu-san’s dad."
UNSPOKEN: That’s right... We convinced her to stay by promising to help look for her father.
Rintaro: "Yeah... I remember."
Mayuri: "I know Suzu-san has a mission and stuff, but I think she also came because she really wanted to meet her dad. Mayushii wants to make that happen!"
UNSPOKEN: If Mayuri feels that strongly about it, there’s no way I can refuse.
Suzuha: "Shiina Mayuri... you’re such a nice girl..."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha sniffles.
Suzuha: "...You’re right. I thought I could find him if I came to this town. I know that he was in Akihabara in 2010."
