Rintaro: How can you give up? We still have one more day!
Suzuha: W-why are you getting mad?
Rintaro: Everyone's fighting for you. Don't you get it!? Me? I want to prioritize Mayuri over everything else! But you're still a lab mem, a friend! When a friend's in trouble, you want to help them. That's how Mayuri felt, and I agree. That's why I'm searching! So how dare you be the first to give up!?
Suzuha: Y-you don't have to yell!
Rintaro: Don't disappoint me like this!
UNSPOKEN: I tell myself to calm down. This is just my own feelings of impotence boiling over. There's no time for this.
Suzuha: I'm sorry. But maybe you should think about how I feel.
UNSPOKEN: I realize that we have an audience. Some pedestrians are grinning at us, like they think we're a bickering couple or something. I take a deep breath.
Rintaro: ...You're right. I shouldn't have said that.
UNSPOKEN: It's too awkward to make eye contact. So I look around, pretending to think.
Rintaro: ...Alright. What next?
UNSPOKEN: I wonder how the other lab mems are progressing. I'm especially concerned about Daru. Depending on the situation, he might need some relief. He's been working in that heat for hours, so we should bring him something cold to drink. And then there's Mayuri. She's been working alone, trying to find some information on Suzuha's father. If I close my eyes, I can still recall her death -- deaths -- in every detail. I resist the urge to pound my head against the wall. Although we still have over 24 hours before that happens, I can't help but worry about leaving her alone. But currently, all I can do is search for that pin.
Mayuri: Tutturuâ™ª Mayushii here.
Rintaro: Where are you now?
Mayuri: Umm, in front of the station.
Rintaro: Let's meet up. Stay right there.
Mayuri: Okay!
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha and I head to the station. When we get there, I hear Mayuri's voice.
Mayuri: Please take one! We need your help!
Rintaro: What is she doing?
Mayuri: There's been a kidnapping! The kidnapper was wearing this pin! Please help us find him!
UNSPOKEN: Why is Mayuri passing out leaflets? When I call out to her, Mayuri smiles and wipes the sweat off her brow with a handkerchief.
Mayuri: Okarin, Suzu-san! Um, there's something I've been meaning to ask.
UNSPOKEN: Yeah?
Mayuri: The 'Barrel' in Suzuha's dad's name. What does it mean?
UNSPOKEN: Uh...
Rintaro: It's just a name. It probably doesn't mean anything.
Mayuri: But it's not his real name, right?
Suzuha: Right. It's a codename.
Mayuri: So why did he choose Barrel Titor? And why did you choose John, Suzu-san?
Suzuha: Because John's the most common English name.
Mayuri: But Barrel isn't common.
Suzuha: Now that you mention it.
