Rintaro: "Akiba is full of niche stores where you can find strange and cool accessories."
UNSPOKEN: It’s hard to sneak into Radi-Kan in the daytime. There isn’t a crowd out front like before, but pedestrian traffic remains constant. It takes us about 30 minutes to find a way in. Kurisu is back at the lab, working on the Time Leap Machine. It needs to be complete by 2 PM on the 13th. If she’s late, it could affect my ability to time leap, which would lower my chances of saving Mayuri. Speaking of Mayuri, she wandered off somewhere in search of Suzuha’s father.
Rintaro: "How does it look?"
UNSPOKEN: I call to Daru, who’s examining the flooded satellite -- I mean, time machine -- while Suzuha and I keep a lookout. Daru crawls out of the machine. He’s covered in sweat, and his breathing is heavy. We quickly help pull his huge body out. The time machine is completely visible from the street. If someone were to see us up here, they might report us to the police. It’s been two weeks since the satellite appeared, but Akiba still has tourists who come just to see it. We need to take care not to be noticed.
Itaru: "It’s so freaking hot in there. It’s worse than a sauna. Spend too much time in there and I’ll turn into Daru jerky. By the way, it’s not gonna fall or anything... right?"
UNSPOKEN: The time machine is balanced precariously on the ledge, but the police have hooked up support wires, so Daru probably has nothing to worry about.
Suzuha: "Can it be fixed?"
Itaru: "Well, I still don’t know for sure. But there is one thing I noticed just now. It’s built kind of like the PhoneWave."
Rintaro: "That means there’s a chance, right!?"
Itaru: "I said I’m not sure. I need to poke around some more."
Rintaro: "Daru. Super Hacka. Everything depends on your skills now. You are the super hacka who will save the world. In 2036, people will worship you instead of Kurisu, the mother of the time machine."
Itaru: "It’s hacker! How many times do I have to tell you!?"
Rintaro: "Anyway, you have two days. Do whatever it takes, Daru."
UNSPOKEN: I place my hand on Daru’s shoulder and look straight into his eyes.
Rintaro: "You’re our only hope."
Itaru: "No promises, man. And why two days?"
Rintaro: "Well..."
UNSPOKEN: Because that’s when Mayuri will die. But I can’t say that.
Suzuha: "In two days, the weather conditions will be perfect for creating the ring singularity. If we miss that window, we won’t have another chance until next year."
UNSPOKEN: Nice excuse, Suzuha!
Rintaro: "P-precisely!"
Itaru: "Fix it in two days? That’s just nuts."
Rintaro: "But if you do, you’ll earn the right to a date with Faris."
Itaru: "...!?"
Rintaro: "Can you fix it?"
Itaru: "No problem!"
