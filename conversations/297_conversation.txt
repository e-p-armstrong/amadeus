Rintaro: It was just a joke. Let it die.
Suzuha: Kurigohan and Kamehameha... so you're the one who kept picking fights with me on the internet. Makes sense.
Kurisu: I thought you wanted an open discussion.
Suzuha: Sure. You were kind of annoying, though.
Kurisu: Hehehe...
Suzuha: Ahaha!
UNSPOKEN: Are these two still fighting?
Rintaro: By the way, it may shock you to learn that I am the poster known as Hououin Kyou--
Kurisu & Suzuha: I know.
UNSPOKEN: Gh, the same reaction again! Why do they only agree when it's at my expense!? I clear my throat and change the subject.
Rintaro: So, what did you want to talk about? The Time Leap Machine?
Kurisu: I think you probably forgot, so I wanted to make sure just in case. Have you been looking for the lifter? You haven't, have you?
UNSPOKEN: Oh, right. We hadn't discovered what it was at this point in time.
Rintaro: I already know. It's the 42-inch CRT downstairs.
Kurisu: R-really? What's your proof?
Rintaro: I've been here before, remember?
Kurisu: I see...
Rintaro: ...Sorry for sticking you with this job.
Kurisu: What? Don't apologize. It's creepy.
Rintaro: I know you're not a fan of time travel research. But here you are building a time machine. I was just worried that maybe you were feeling conflicted.
Kurisu: How rude.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's scowls.
Kurisu: I'm sure I've said this before, but I've always accepted time travel as a theory. I just don't trust people who claim it can be done despite how unrealistic it is.
UNSPOKEN: She sighs, then looks me over from head to toe.
Kurisu: Besides, I can hardly deny it with evidence staring me in the face. Though I still don't like the idea of being called the mother of the time machine.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha shrugs at this.
Kurisu: Anyway. If you're apologizing, that must mean you helped out the first time.
Rintaro: The first time?
Kurisu: Before you started time leaping. You helped me build the machine, didn't you?
Rintaro: Yeah. Daru and I helped.
Kurisu: Then don't worry about it. I wouldn't want you to have to do it all over again. And right now, it's more important to repair Amane-san's time machine and search for her father.
Suzuha: ...Sorry.
Kurisu: Don't you apologize now. It's weird. Welp, back to work. I should be able to get a lot done now that I know about the lifter.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu waves and vanishes into the development room. I'd better not disturb her. The time limit is approaching. What else can I do?
Itaru: Hoihoi.
Rintaro: It's me. Report.
Itaru: You know, it's distracting as hell when you talk like that.
Rintaro: Enough about you. Report the status of the repairs.
Itaru: I'm turning into a prune here! Hey, at least give me some reaction. Anyway, I think I figured out what it needs.
Rintaro: Really!?
Itaru: Pretty much.
Rintaro: Should I bring reinforcements?
Itaru: Mm, yeah, I guess. Bring Amane-shi with you if you can. Alone in the heat of the vacant Radi-Kan rooftop, the two of us can forget our shame and take off our clothes. Haah haah...
