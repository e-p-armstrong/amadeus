Rintaro: "Have you met me in the future?"
UNSPOKEN: She did say I was an infamous terrorist in 2036. For some reason, Suzuha’s expression darkens momentarily.
Suzuha: "...No. Never."
Rintaro: "Oh... So, why are you showing me this?"
Suzuha: "When the meter reads over 1%, you’ve made it to the Beta worldline."
Rintaro: "1%..."
Suzuha: "Right. Reach 1% divergence... and you’ll save Shiina Mayuri."
UNSPOKEN: I stare at the glowing red numbers. They don’t budge. Just another 0. 6%... it seems so easy. But there are six digits after the decimal point, and no tens place. What does that mean? Something tells me it won’t be as easy as it looks.
Suzuha: "You can have it. No point in me carrying it around. I hope you’ll find a use for it."
UNSPOKEN: Based on recommendations from the BBS thread, I spend the morning visiting stores in Akiba. My destinations run the gamut from otaku stores packed with anime goods to souvenir shops full of Olympic memorabilia. I even visit a few that specialize in locally-manufactured goods. But although I hit just about every kind of store that could be considered niche, I am unable to find anything that resembles Suzuha’s pin. Maybe I should go all the way to Ikebukuro or Nakano. I start heading back to the lab, but just then, a street vendor catches my eye. The storekeeper is a foreigner covered in tattoos. The table next to him is covered with accessories and other fashion items. This is the first time I’ve seen such a stylish street stand in Akiba. Most vendors just sell random junk. It’s not like I have anything to lose, so I walk over and check out the selection. Among the various accessories, I see a number of metal pins. What a coincidence. Could he have a pin like Suzuha’s? I don’t see the OSHM***A 7010 logo on any of the displayed accessories, but I’d better ask just to be sure. Umm... he’s a foreigner... so maybe I should use English? Our eyes meet. His are as bright and blue as the sky. I quickly look away. Damn! He must think I’m a coward. Better get this over with.
Rintaro: "HEY, MASTER. I AM MAD SCIENTIST. SO COOOOL. SONUVABITCH!"
Master: "Can I help you?"
UNSPOKEN: He smiles a wide, toothy smile -- nice teeth -- and answers in Japanese. I was hoping for more of a reaction...
Rintaro: "Um, I have a question, if you don’t mind."
UNSPOKEN: I take the photocopy of Suzuha’s pin out of my pocket.
Rintaro: "Does this look familiar?"
UNSPOKEN: The man stares at it for a while, then shrugs and shakes his head in the exaggerated manner typical of westerners.
Rintaro: "I want to know where it came from. Can you help me find out?"
