Suzuha: Anyway, I don't want that to happen to you guys. That's one more reason I need to find an IBN 5100 and change the future. Until I came to this time, you guys were just stories, history. But now... you're my friends. I want to save you.
Rintaro: ...Appreciated. You are a lab mem, now and forevermore.
Suzuha: Ahaha! Thanks.
UNSPOKEN: I already told Kurisu that I was confident in her ability to complete the machine on time. But it occurs to me that I forgot to tell her about the 42-inch CRT. There, that should do it. I send a reply and decide to keep searching for the pin with Suzuha just a bit longer. Time is quickly running out. Is there anything more that we can do? It's early evening, but the roof of Radi-Kan is still hotter than hell. When I provide Daru with the refreshing gift of Dr P, a frown appears on his sweaty face.
Itaru: You're supposed to give me an ice cold zero calorie cola. Common sense, man...
UNSPOKEN: I forgot he's a cola guy. No sense letting it go to waste. I drink the Dr P myself. Daru and Suzuha start discussing the time machine. Mayuri and I watch from a short distance away.
Mayuri: Hey, Okarin. Isn't it amazing that the satellite was a time machine?
Rintaro: Yeah, I guess so.
UNSPOKEN: I thought that Titor's time machine was a car -- a 1970s Chevy. It never even occurred to me to suspect the satellite. I should know better than to take anything for granted. In retrospect, the satellite was suspicious from the start. Not only had it appeared out of nowhere, but Titor only starting posting afterwards.  I'm disappointed in myself for not realizing the connection.
Mayuri: I'm glad Suzu-san wasn't hurt in the crash.
UNSPOKEN: I doubt it was anything like a crash. It probably just appeared there, displacing the wall, which then collapsed around it. After all, the time machine isn't self-propelled. It doesn't fly.
Mayuri: I heard it's really hard to drive.
UNSPOKEN: I guess she heard that from Suzuha.
Mayuri: If the gravitational whatchamacallit coordinates are just a teensy bit off, the whole time machine becomes a jellyman and goes ploop. And she even said her time machine's unstable, since it's not a SERN model. I'm worried about her trip to 1975... Do you think I should go with her? I wonder if I'd fit.
Rintaro: What would you do in 1975?
Mayuri: I'd cheer Suzu-san on, of course! I'd hold her hand super tight, and tell her that everything's going to be okay!
UNSPOKEN: Something tells me that won't be much help.
Mayuri: Hey, Okarin, do you think the time machine has a name?
Rintaro: A name...
