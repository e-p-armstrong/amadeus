Rintaro: "That’s what I want to know. I’ll compensate you."
Master: "I sorry."
UNSPOKEN: He apologizes in broken Japanese. It looks like this is another dead end. Just in case, I give him my contact information and ask him to get in touch if he finds out anything. Then I turn to leave.
Suzuha: "Okabe Rintaro."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha’s standing a short distance away. She’s holding a drink. It’s my favorite, Dr P -- no, wait, that’s cola.
Suzuha: "’Sup. Want a drink?"
UNSPOKEN: I accept the offer, and quench my thirst while leaning on the roadside fence. Last time I saw her, Suzuha was on her way to Kanda to continue the search. How long has she been standing here?
Rintaro: "Anything?"
Suzuha: "Nope. So what was with your English back there? It sounded dumb. ’So cooool.’ Is that standard English in this era?"
Rintaro: "Of course not."
Suzuha: "Oh, so it’s an Okabe Rintaro original. There’s no overseas travel in my time, so I wouldn’t know."
Rintaro: "No overseas travel? What, you mean at all?"
Suzuha: "Pretty much. Travel permits are hard to get, and they’d never issue one for a vacation. I’d never seen a foreigner before coming to this time."
UNSPOKEN: So in the future, no one is allowed to leave Japan? Japan was like that a few centuries ago too, when the Tokugawa shogunate closed the country to the west. It sounds like SERN set international relations back hundreds of years. Perhaps that’s why there’s no war in Suzuha’s time. It’s hard for conflicts to emerge when races and cultures can’t interact. It sounds kind of like a prison with invisible walls, guarded by SERN and the Committee of 300. I mean, ending war is obviously a good thing, but... Anyway, there’s no point thinking about the distant future now. We need to come up with a new plan. The sunlight beats on my head, making it hard to think. I feel like I’m standing in a sauna. Why does the sun hate me so much? Shining in the center of the sky like he owns the damn place... Dammit! Why can’t we find any information on that pin? I suppose it’s no skin off my back if we don’t find Suzuha’s father. As long as Daru fixes the time machine, nothing else matters. So why do I feel so bad about my lack of progress? I really don’t know. Maybe I’m just frustrated by my own powerlessness. I can’t save Mayuri. I can’t fix Suzuha’s time machine. I can’t even help Kurisu with the Time Leap upgrade. So what am I good for? The only thing I can do is help Suzuha find her father.
Rintaro: "...Maybe this pin is newer than we think. I mean, maybe it hasn’t been made yet."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha stretches, then looks at me with a calm smile.
Suzuha: "Maybe I’m not meant to meet him. I mean, we’ve tried everything and still no sign. It’s just not in the cards, I guess."
