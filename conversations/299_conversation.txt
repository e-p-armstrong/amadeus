Mayuri: Oh, yeah! Mayushii didn't think of that. Ehehe!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri giggles, then runs off to talk to Suzuha. She comes back quickly.
Mayuri: Yup. It has a name.
Rintaro: What is it?
Mayuri: FG204 something something, she said.
UNSPOKEN: Something something?
Mayuri: Anyway, don't you think Daru-kun and Suzu-san are a good match?
Rintaro: Huh?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri's jumping all over the place today. I look at Daru and Suzuha again.
Rintaro: How do you figure? Daru's all about Faris, you know.
Mayuri: Oh... really?
UNSPOKEN: She tilts her head to the side. Good grief... Mayuri and I aren't of any use. I would prefer to leave Daru and Suzuha to it and resume the search for Suzuha's father, but Mayuri seems happy just sitting here. We don't have any leads on the pin or its owner. Maybe two days just aren't enough. No, that's quitter's talk. Like I told Suzuha, I don't want to give up. Besides, even if we don't get the information we need this time, I can use the Time Leap Machine to repeat these two days until we do.
Rintaro: Oh yeah, Mayuri. What happened to your costumes?
UNSPOKEN: There's only a few more days until ComiMa. I remember Mayuri pulling all-nighters to get her costume done. Has that changed?
Mayuri: Hm? I already made two costumes. One for Kaede-chan and one for Fubuki-chan.
Rintaro: Weren't you making a third one for Lukako?
Mayuri: Yeah, I was. But I couldn't convince her, so I gave up this time. Hey, can Mayushii take a closer look at the time machine?
Rintaro: Just don't get in their way.
Mayuri: Okeydokeyâ™ª
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri beams happily, then runs over to the time machine. She's acting like this is a field trip... Behind her, the sun glows dark and orange on the horizon. It's quite a view from up here. After a few minutes watching the sunset in silence, I realize that Suzuha is standing beside me. She must have come over as Mayuri left. Our shadows are long and murky.
Suzuha: Hashida Itaru's amazing. He said if things go well, he could have the time machine fixed by tomorrow.
Rintaro: He's a man who gets things done.
Suzuha: And he looks so unhealthy and slow.
Rintaro: Don't judge a book by its cover.
Suzuha: Yeah. I have a better impression of him now. Umm... hey. There's something I want to say, and I feel like I'll never get another chance.
Rintaro: Why so melodramatic?
Suzuha: I'm really grateful to you. All of you. When I came to this time, I didn't know anyone. I was all alone in a world completely different from my own. This era is so peaceful. That's a wonderful thing... but it scared me. All I knew was the fight against SERN. But now I have friends... real friends, who I can share my secrets with. All these people who lived before I was born are working so hard for my sake. It's a strange feeling... but a happy one, too. I wanted you to know that.
