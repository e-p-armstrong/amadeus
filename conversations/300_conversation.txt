Mayuri: "Well, whatcha think? I think it’s a masterpiece!"
Rintaro: "What’s this kidnapping stuff about?"
Mayuri: "It was my idea. I’m sure it’ll make everyone want to help!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri grins triumphantly.
Mayuri: "It’s a good strategy, dontcha think? Umm, the operation name is ’Mayushii’s Awesome Leaflet Plan’."
Suzuha: "Um... isn’t this going a little too far?"
UNSPOKEN: Yeah, what happens if the police hear about--
Policeman: "You three."
Rintaro: "!?"
UNSPOKEN: My heart freezes as if sprayed with liquid nitrogen. I slowly turn around... A stern-faced policeman is standing there with crossed arms. Speak of the devil!
Policeman: "What are these leaflets about? Let’s talk at the station."
Mayuri: "Ehh?"
UNSPOKEN: I consider making a run for it, but that will just make things worse. I grab Suzuha’s arm before she can do anything rash. Better just to bite the bullet and go along. After about an hour of interrogation, they release us without charges. Kurisu greets the three of us when we return to the lab dead tired.
Kurisu: "Hey, Okabe, remember the lifter? I don’t suppose you’ve figured out what it is... no, of course you haven’t."
UNSPOKEN: Oh, right. We hadn’t discovered the lifter at this point in time.
Rintaro: "I already know. It’s the 42-inch CRT downstairs."
Kurisu: "R-really? What’s your proof?"
Rintaro: "I’ve been here before, remember?"
Kurisu: "...Oh, right. The CRT... I see..."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu heads back into the development room, nodding to herself.
Mayuri: "I’m sorry, guys. I made things worse..."
UNSPOKEN: I give Mayuri some chicken to cheer her up. There’s not much time left. What else can we do before the time limit?
Kurisu: "Hello."
Rintaro: "Assistant? It’s me."
Kurisu: "Oh, I think you got the wrong number."
Rintaro: "What are you saying? It’s me, Hououin Kyouma."
Kurisu: "My name isn’t Assistant. And your name isn’t Hououin Kyouma."
Rintaro: "Would you prefer to be called ’KuriGohan and Kamehameha’?"
Kurisu: "Bwah!?"
UNSPOKEN: I hear rattling from the other side of the phone.
Kurisu: "How do you know about that!?"
Rintaro: "Before I time leaped, you made a tearful confession. You said, ’I’m an @channeler, a Nicojunkie, and a camwhore who posts tits, but will you still accept me as your assistant?’ And I, of course, replied... ’You may be an @channeler, a Nicojunkie, and a camwhore who posts tits, but you’re still a member of this lab. And that makes you my assistant, now and forever. So wipe your tears, for there is still much--’"
Kurisu: "I’m gonna post your personal info all over VIP if you don’t shut your mouth right this second!"
Rintaro: "...How are things there?"
Kurisu: "Fine. You called at the right time. We need to talk."
