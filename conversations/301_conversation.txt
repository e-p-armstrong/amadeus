Rintaro: "I’ll be right there."
Kurisu: "OK. I’ll be waiting."
UNSPOKEN: I take Suzuha back to the lab. Kurisu greets us with a cold stare when we return to the lab.
Kurisu: "For your information, I don’t post t...ti... I don’t post pictures of my chest, okay!?"
Rintaro: "It was just a joke. Let it die."
Suzuha: "Kurigohan and Kamehameha... so you’re the one who kept picking fights with me on the internet. Makes sense."
Kurisu: "I thought you wanted an open discussion."
Suzuha: "Sure. You were kind of annoying, though."
Kurisu: "Hehehe..."
Suzuha: "Ahaha!"
UNSPOKEN: Are these two still fighting?
Rintaro: "By the way, it may shock you to learn that I am the poster known as Hououin Kyou--"
Kurisu & Suzuha: "I know."
UNSPOKEN: Gh, the same reaction again! Why do they only agree when it’s at my expense!? I clear my throat and change the subject.
Rintaro: "So, what did you want to talk about? The Time Leap Machine?"
Kurisu: "I think you probably forgot, so I wanted to make sure just in case. Have you been looking for the lifter? You haven’t, have you?"
UNSPOKEN: Oh, right. We hadn’t discovered what it was at this point in time.
Rintaro: "I already know. It’s the 42-inch CRT downstairs."
Kurisu: "R-really? What’s your proof?"
Rintaro: "I’ve been here before, remember?"
Kurisu: "I see..."
Rintaro: "...Sorry for sticking you with this job."
Kurisu: "What? Don’t apologize. It’s creepy."
Rintaro: "I know you’re not a fan of time travel research. But here you are building a time machine. I was just worried that maybe you were feeling conflicted."
Kurisu: "How rude."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu’s scowls.
Kurisu: "I’m sure I’ve said this before, but I’ve always accepted time travel as a theory. I just don’t trust people who claim it can be done despite how unrealistic it is."
UNSPOKEN: She sighs, then looks me over from head to toe.
Kurisu: "Besides, I can hardly deny it with evidence staring me in the face. Though I still don’t like the idea of being called the mother of the time machine."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha shrugs at this.
Kurisu: "Anyway. If you’re apologizing, that must mean you helped out the first time."
Rintaro: "The first time?"
Kurisu: "Before you started time leaping. You helped me build the machine, didn’t you?"
Rintaro: "Yeah. Daru and I helped."
Kurisu: "Then don’t worry about it. I wouldn’t want you to have to do it all over again. And right now, it’s more important to repair Amane-san’s time machine and search for her father."
Suzuha: "...Sorry."
Kurisu: "Don’t you apologize now. It’s weird. Welp, back to work. I should be able to get a lot done now that I know about the lifter."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu waves and vanishes into the development room. I’d better not disturb her. The time limit is approaching. What else can I do?
Itaru: "Hoihoi."
