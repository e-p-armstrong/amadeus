Suzuha: Living with you guys in this time... it's been really fun. When I met you, you were all so strange and unique and over the top... I was kind of shocked at first, actually. But before I knew it, I started to enjoy spending time with you. 2036 is peaceful too. People don't even fight anymore. Did you know that?
Rintaro: How could I? I'm not even alive in 2036, right?
Suzuha: Oh... right. Sorry. Anyway, people don't fight. Ever. About anything. All forms of conflict, war included, have vanished -- poof -- without a trace. Instead, everyone has dead eyes, like fish. No one has ambition. Nobody dreams. They just trudge through their lives without a single complaint. Oh sure, people smile. But they never get angry or sad. There's no individuality. Everyone's a robot. You got really mad at me before, remember? I was really surprised. But at the same time... I was really happy.
Rintaro: You're a strange girl.
Suzuha: Ahaha. I guess so.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha looks at the time machine. Daru and Mayuri are standing next to it, talking cheerfully about something or another.
Suzuha: You're all so bright and full of life. I envy you. Shiina Mayuri, Hashida Itaru... even Makise Kurisu. And of course, you.
Rintaro: ...Don't be ridiculous.
UNSPOKEN: There's nothing enviable about me. I'm worthless. I can't even save Mayuri.
Suzuha: I want to be more like you.
Rintaro: If you ask me, you're the amazing one.
Suzuha: I'm... happy to hear you say that. It's thanks to all of you that I'm still going strong. Being a lab mem, even for just a little while... was great.
UNSPOKEN: She smiles then -- a soft, sad smile that tears at my heart. What does it mean?
Suzuha: Being with you guys, even for just a little while... was great.
Rintaro: ...Suzuha?
Suzuha: Change the future, Okabe Rintaro. Make it a world like this one, where people can be free.
Rintaro: Hey, come on. Why are you being so sentimental?
UNSPOKEN: Does she not want to go to 1975? But I mean, she's got a time machine, so can't she just come back afterwards? Even as I think it, I realize how wrong I am. ...Of course. When Suzuha completes her mission and brings us the IBN 5100, the worldline will change. The future will be rewritten, and the 2036 she knows will cease to exist. To hear her describe it, the future is an awful place. But even so, it was her home. She has friends there, I'm sure, comrades-in-arms, and memories of her father, Barrel Titor. All of that will be lost to her forever. No wonder she's getting sentimental.
Rintaro: After we fix the time machine, let's have a party.
Suzuha: ...Thanks.
