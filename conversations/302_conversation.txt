Itaru: "You know, it’s distracting as hell when you talk like that."
Rintaro: "Enough about you. Report the status of the repairs."
Itaru: "I’m turning into a prune here! Hey, at least give me some reaction. Anyway, I think I figured out what it needs."
Rintaro: "Really!?"
Itaru: "Pretty much."
Rintaro: "Should I bring reinforcements?"
Itaru: "Mm, yeah, I guess. Bring Amane-shi with you if you can. Alone in the heat of the vacant Radi-Kan rooftop, the two of us can forget our shame and take off our clothes. Haah haah..."
Rintaro: "I hope we find your dried-up bones."
Itaru: "Gonna have to disappoint you there. How about you? Did you find out anything about the pin?"
Rintaro: "No. It’s an uphill battle."
Itaru: "Not even a clue?"
Rintaro: "No..."
Itaru: "Damn, that sucks."
Rintaro: "I’m going to hit up a few more places. I’ll head over there in the evening."
UNSPOKEN: That gives me two more hours today to search for the pin. If that fails, tomorrow morning will be our last chance. These two extra days have gone by faster than expected. We decide to try Ikebukuro as our last stop for today. It would be nice to visit home, but I don’t have the time, and besides, Suzuha’s with me. ...Our search turns up nothing. As the evening wears on without a single lead, Suzuha and I grow quieter and quieter. We’re exhausted from walking, and we can’t shake the feeling that all our efforts are futile. This isn’t good.
Rintaro: "By the way..."
UNSPOKEN: I try stirring up conversation. I should get her to talk about the future. After all, she is a time traveler. This is a once in a lifetime chance. I remember how shocked Kurisu was to learn that she only lives to be 44. And I was told... that I become a terrorist.
Rintaro: "Am I really famous in 2036?"
Suzuha: "As a terrorist."
Rintaro: "Oh. So what did I do to be called a terrorist?"
Suzuha: "You rebelled against SERN. You’re actually one of the founding members of the Resistance. Just like my dad."
UNSPOKEN: I help found the Resistance... I guess it makes sense, given what we’re going through now. Suzuha is from the future of this timeline, where Mayuri is doomed to die, and where SERN forces Kurisu to build a time machine. In such a future, how could I not rebel against SERN? Rebellion against the system. Destruction of order. A new age of chaos. Weren’t those my ambitions as a mad scientist?
Rintaro: "How stupid..."
Suzuha: "Stupid?"
Rintaro: "How can I still be chasing some chuunibyou fantasy... when I couldn’t even save Mayuri?"
Suzuha: "You’re fighting to free humanity. I think it’s a noble cause."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha is part of the Resistance I form. Does that mean she’s my subordinate in the future?
Rintaro: "What sort of man am I?"
