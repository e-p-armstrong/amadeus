Rintaro: Then why does the path there change?
Suzuha: Because the worldline changes. When you leap into the past and take different actions from before, divergence changes, if only a little bit. In most cases, that fluctuation won't amount to more than 0. 000001% on the divergence meter. Small changes might not register at all. When you change the cause, the effect merely shifts to a separate, already-existing worldline. Since those two worldlines are almost exactly the same, you barely feel any difference.
UNSPOKEN: So is that why Reading Steiner didn't react?
Suzuha: It's not like the previous worldline disappears. It keeps existing as another possible worldline.
Kurisu: That's the many-worlds interpretation, right?
Suzuha: In any case, they're not parallel worlds.
Rintaro: So is the future reconstructed?
Suzuha: I guess you could say that.
UNSPOKEN: I'm confused again. Maybe it's impossible for me to fully understand the structure of the universe. Anyway, that's enough discussion. It's time for me to leap again. I explain the situation to Kurisu and have her activate the Time Leap Machine immediately. It's the night of the 11th. I went back about 40 hours. My objective is to keep watch on the street vendor's stand in the hope that Suzuha's father might appear. I sent Suzuha elsewhere. I don't want her to be disappointed if I come up empty-handed. I'm standing out of sight a short distance away from the stand, munching on energy bars and soy milk to appease my growling stomach. I've already been here for two hours. I forgot to ask for the exact time the suspicious character appeared, so I had to begin my stakeout before sunset. Now it's 8 PM and the stand looks like it's about to close. Is this another waste of time? Did that foreigner give me false information? But just as I'm finishing my milk... Someone approaches the stand.
Rintaro: Is that...!?
UNSPOKEN: I jump out of cover.
Rintaro: Daru!
Itaru: Okarin!?
UNSPOKEN: Daru jumps in surprise. But I'm the one who's really shocked here.
Rintaro: What are you doing here!?
Itaru: I was gonna ask the same question.
UNSPOKEN: The storekeeper is looking at us funny, so we decide to change locations.
Rintaro: Alright, Daru. What were you doing at that street stand? Don't tell me you were trying to counterfeit duplicates of Titor's pin.
Itaru: ...F-fine. I won't tell you then.
UNSPOKEN: So that's what happened. Daru was the suspicious character the foreigner told me about. So all that stuff about judo, pro wrestling, and balloons was referring to Daru's size?
Rintaro: Could he have been more confusing!?
UNSPOKEN: Damn! It was all for nothing! Good thing I didn't bring Suzuha along.
Rintaro: So why were you trying to make counterfeit versions of the pin?
Itaru: Uh, I wasn't trying to counterfeit it.
Rintaro: Close enough.
Itaru: Well... I meant it as a backup plan, I guess. Amane-shi's gonna be sad if we don't find her old man, right? So if that happens, I'll show her the badges I made and, well, lie that her dad was here...
