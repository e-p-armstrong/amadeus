UNSPOKEN: I guess she heard that from Suzuha.
Mayuri: "If the gravitational whatchamacallit coordinates are just a teensy bit off, the whole time machine becomes a jellyman and goes ploop. And she even said her time machine’s unstable, since it’s not a SERN model. I’m worried about her trip to 1975... Do you think I should go with her? I wonder if I’d fit."
Rintaro: "What would you do in 1975?"
Mayuri: "I’d cheer Suzu-san on, of course! I’d hold her hand super tight, and tell her that everything’s going to be okay!"
UNSPOKEN: Something tells me that won’t be much help.
Mayuri: "Hey, Okarin, do you think the time machine has a name?"
Rintaro: "A name..."
UNSPOKEN: That’s the least of what I want to know about the time machine. Time permitting, I’d like to spend a whole day picking Suzuha’s brain. I’m pretty sure John Titor’s time machine had a model number. But the John Titor from 2000 might not have been Suzuha. There was no John Titor in 2000 on this worldline, after all. Although... I suppose it’s possible that Suzuha will drop by 2000 after traveling to 1975.
Rintaro: "If you want to know, just ask Titor."
Mayuri: "Oh, yeah! Mayushii didn’t think of that. Ehehe!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri giggles, then runs off to talk to Suzuha. She comes back quickly.
Mayuri: "Yup. It has a name."
Rintaro: "What is it?"
Mayuri: "FG204 something something, she said."
UNSPOKEN: Something something?
Mayuri: "Anyway, don’t you think Daru-kun and Suzu-san are a good match?"
Rintaro: "Huh?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri’s jumping all over the place today. I look at Daru and Suzuha again.
Rintaro: "How do you figure? Daru’s all about Faris, you know."
Mayuri: "Oh... really?"
UNSPOKEN: She tilts her head to the side. Good grief... Mayuri and I aren’t of any use. I would prefer to leave Daru and Suzuha to it and resume the search for Suzuha’s father, but Mayuri seems happy just sitting here. We don’t have any leads on the pin or its owner. Maybe two days just aren’t enough. No, that’s quitter’s talk. Like I told Suzuha, I don’t want to give up. Besides, even if we don’t get the information we need this time, I can use the Time Leap Machine to repeat these two days until we do.
Rintaro: "Oh yeah, Mayuri. What happened to your costumes?"
UNSPOKEN: There’s only a few more days until ComiMa. I remember Mayuri pulling all-nighters to get her costume done. Has that changed?
Mayuri: "Hm? I already made two costumes. One for Kaede-chan and one for Fubuki-chan."
Rintaro: "Weren’t you making a third one for Lukako?"
Mayuri: "Yeah, I was. But I couldn’t convince her, so I gave up this time. Hey, can Mayushii take a closer look at the time machine?"
