UNSPOKEN: Daru happily takes the cola and chugs it straight from the bottle. Afterwards, Daru and Suzuha start discussing the time machine. Mayuri and I watch from a short distance away.
Mayuri: Hey, Okarin. Isn't it amazing that the satellite was a time machine?
Rintaro: Yeah, I guess so.
Mayuri: I'm glad Suzu-san wasn't hurt in the crash. I heard it's really hard to drive. If the gravitational whatchamacallit coordinates are just a teensy bit off, the whole time machine becomes a jellyman and goes ploop. And she even said her time machine's unstable, since it's not a SERN model. I'm worried about her trip to 1975... Do you think I should go with her? I wonder if I'd fit.
Rintaro: What would you do in 1975?
Mayuri: I'd cheer Suzu-san on, of course! I'd hold her hand super tight, and tell her that everything's going to be okay! Hey, Okarin, do you think the time machine has a name?
Rintaro: If you want to know, just ask Titor.
Mayuri: Oh, yeah! Mayushii didn't think of that. Ehehe!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri giggles, then runs off to talk to Suzuha. She returns a few seconds later.
Mayuri: Yup. It has a name. FG204 something something, she said. Anyway, don't you think Daru-kun and Suzu-san are a good match?
UNSPOKEN: I look at Daru and Suzuha again.
Rintaro: Daru's all about Faris.
Mayuri: Oh... really?
UNSPOKEN: She tilts her head to the side.
Mayuri: Hey, can Mayushii take a closer look at the time machine?
UNSPOKEN: I nod, and Mayuri runs over to the time machine again. Behind her, the sun glows dark and orange on the horizon. As Mayuri leaves, Suzuha comes over to stand beside me. Our shadows are long and murky in the fading light.
Suzuha: Hashida Itaru's amazing. He said if things go well, he could have the time machine fixed by tomorrow. And he looks so unhealthy and slow.
UNSPOKEN: A refreshing breeze blows by. It was quite hot a few minutes ago, but the temperature's finally starting to drop.
Suzuha: Umm... hey. There's something I want to say, and I feel like I'll never get another chance. Are you listening?
UNSPOKEN: After a moment's hesitation, I give a little nod.
Suzuha: I'm really grateful to you. All of you. When I came to this time, I didn't know anyone. I was all alone in a world completely different from my own. This era is so peaceful. That's a wonderful thing... but it scared me. All I knew was the fight against SERN. But now I have friends... real friends, who I can share my secrets with. All these people who lived before I was born are working so hard for my sake. It's a strange feeling... but a happy one, too. I wanted you to know that.
