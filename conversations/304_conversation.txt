Itaru: You don't have to put it like that. Remember, there are good lies and bad lies: bad lies hurt people, good lies save them!
Rintaro: What eroge did you get that from?
Itaru: CLADDAN... and it's not an eroge, it's a visual novel that teaches you the meaning of life, so shut up! So... should I call off Operation Fake Titor?
Rintaro: Do you really think that will make Suzuha happy?
UNSPOKEN: Daru's expression suddenly turns sad.
Itaru: Amane-shi told me not to tell anyone, but... I guess I'd better tell you.
UNSPOKEN: He's got a big mouth, as usual. Still, he seems dead serious, so I'd better hear him out.
Itaru: I heard this from Amane-shi when we were discussing the repairs. Her time machine... can only leap to the past.
Rintaro: ...What?
UNSPOKEN: At first, I don't understand what he means.
Rintaro: Nonsense. Titor's time machine could travel both ways.
Itaru: Did you actually see it?
Rintaro: Well, no...
Itaru: Besides, when you say Titor, you mean the one who appeared in 2000, don't you? I don't know anything about that Titor.
UNSPOKEN: That's right. The Titor I know and Suzuha aren't necessarily the same person. Although their time machines are similar, there are significant differences. For example, one looks like a Chevy, and the other looks like a satellite.
Rintaro: So... wait.
Itaru: Once she leaves, she can't come back.
Rintaro: You're saying that if she goes to 1975, she can't return to 2010?
Itaru: Not without living 35 years in real time.
UNSPOKEN: Is he serious?
Rintaro: Does that mean Suzuha's time machine can never return to 2036?
Itaru: Didn't I just say that?
Rintaro: Then it's defective!
Itaru: Right. She said the time machine was incomplete.
UNSPOKEN: Incomplete? Incomplete!?
Itaru: According to Amane-shi, her old man built it in secret by reverse-engineering SERN technology. But SERN killed him before he could complete it. Amane-shi insists that it's fine as long as she can leap to the past, but...
Rintaro: Are you sure about this?
Itaru: She said so herself. I don't think she was lying. So if she doesn't meet her old man before the time machine is repaired... She might never get another chance.
UNSPOKEN: So that's why he was trying to make a copy of that pin. As evidence that Suzuha's father was here.
Rintaro: But making a fake version of her father's pin isn't going to solve anything. A lie is a lie.
Itaru: But if we don't get caught...
