Mayuri: "Okeydokey♪"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri beams happily, then runs over to the time machine. She’s acting like this is a field trip... Behind her, the sun glows dark and orange on the horizon. It’s quite a view from up here. After a few minutes watching the sunset in silence, I realize that Suzuha is standing beside me. She must have come over as Mayuri left. Our shadows are long and murky.
Suzuha: "Hashida Itaru’s amazing. He said if things go well, he could have the time machine fixed by tomorrow."
Rintaro: "He’s a man who gets things done."
Suzuha: "And he looks so unhealthy and slow."
Rintaro: "Don’t judge a book by its cover."
Suzuha: "Yeah. I have a better impression of him now. Umm... hey. There’s something I want to say, and I feel like I’ll never get another chance."
Rintaro: "Why so melodramatic?"
Suzuha: "I’m really grateful to you. All of you. When I came to this time, I didn’t know anyone. I was all alone in a world completely different from my own. This era is so peaceful. That’s a wonderful thing... but it scared me. All I knew was the fight against SERN. But now I have friends... real friends, who I can share my secrets with. All these people who lived before I was born are working so hard for my sake. It’s a strange feeling... but a happy one, too. I wanted you to know that."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha’s tone is wistful. Why? I try to speak, but she continues before I can.
Suzuha: "Living with you guys in this time... it’s been really fun. When I met you, you were all so strange and unique and over the top... I was kind of shocked at first, actually. But before I knew it, I started to enjoy spending time with you. 2036 is peaceful too. People don’t even fight anymore. Did you know that?"
Rintaro: "How could I? I’m not even alive in 2036, right?"
Suzuha: "Oh... right. Sorry. Anyway, people don’t fight. Ever. About anything. All forms of conflict, war included, have vanished -- poof -- without a trace. Instead, everyone has dead eyes, like fish. No one has ambition. Nobody dreams. They just trudge through their lives without a single complaint. Oh sure, people smile. But they never get angry or sad. There’s no individuality. Everyone’s a robot. You got really mad at me before, remember? I was really surprised. But at the same time... I was really happy."
Rintaro: "You’re a strange girl."
Suzuha: "Ahaha. I guess so."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha looks at the time machine. Daru and Mayuri are standing next to it, talking cheerfully about something or another.
Suzuha: "You’re all so bright and full of life. I envy you. Shiina Mayuri, Hashida Itaru... even Makise Kurisu. And of course, you."
Rintaro: "...Don’t be ridiculous."
