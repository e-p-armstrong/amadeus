Rintaro: "If you ask me, you’re the amazing one."
Suzuha: "I’m... happy to hear you say that. It’s thanks to all of you that I’m still going strong. Being a lab mem, even for just a little while... was great."
UNSPOKEN: She smiles then -- a soft, sad smile that tears at my heart. What does it mean?
Suzuha: "Being with you guys, even for just a little while... was great."
Rintaro: "...Suzuha?"
Suzuha: "Change the future, Okabe Rintaro. Make it a world like this one, where people can be free."
Rintaro: "Hey, come on. Why are you being so sentimental?"
UNSPOKEN: Does she not want to go to 1975? But I mean, she’s got a time machine, so can’t she just come back afterwards? Even as I think it, I realize how wrong I am. ...Of course. When Suzuha completes her mission and brings us the IBN 5100, the worldline will change. The future will be rewritten, and the 2036 she knows will cease to exist. To hear her describe it, the future is an awful place. But even so, it was her home. She has friends there, I’m sure, comrades-in-arms, and memories of her father, Barrel Titor. All of that will be lost to her forever. No wonder she’s getting sentimental.
Rintaro: "After we fix the time machine, let’s have a party."
Suzuha: "...Thanks."
UNSPOKEN: And yet, she’s still smiling that sorrowful smile. Afterwards, I hit the streets again in search of the pin. But the day ended without a single lead, so I reluctantly returned to the lab and tried searching the internet. A couple of hours later, and still no luck. So far, I’ve accomplished absolutely nothing. My frustration is mounting. I can time leap again, but will that really help us find Suzuha’s father? An unfamiliar number. Who is it?
Rintaro: "It’s me."
Foreigner: "Hi, Mistah Okabe Rintaro?"
UNSPOKEN: The voice is heavily accented. I can barely make it out. Who is this guy?
Rintaro: "SERN!?"
UNSPOKEN: I jump to my feet and scan the room, then run to the window and check the road below. No suspicious figures in sight. Kurisu comes out of the development room and gives me a questioning look, but I wave her back inside.
Foreigner: "SERN? What is dat?"
UNSPOKEN: I gulp and carefully choose my words.
Rintaro: "Identify yourself."
