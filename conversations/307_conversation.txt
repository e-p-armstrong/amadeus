Rintaro: "Anything else?"
Master: "Um? Maybe a judo fighter? Or, pro wrestler?"
Rintaro: "What? Judo? Pro wrestler? What do you mean by that?"
Master: "YES!"
UNSPOKEN: That wasn’t a yes/no question. What the hell do you mean!?
Master: "Ahh, balloon. Was balloon!"
Rintaro: "Balloon? Judo? Pro wrestling?"
Master: "Good!"
UNSPOKEN: No! Not good! Are you trying to confuse me!? I want to ask more questions, but the foreigner suddenly sees a policeman walking by and runs off. I consider chasing him, but decide against it to avoid police attention. I give up... The search has hit a dead end, and we have barely any time left to find Barrel Titor. I can time leap again starting at 2 PM tomorrow. Looks like all I can do is wait until Christina’s done working, and then leap to the time this suspicious character appears at the stand. Kurisu carefully connects the two cords she’s holding.
Kurisu: "Done."
UNSPOKEN: The Time Leap Machine is complete. It’s 2:30 PM on the 13th, about 20 minutes later than before. Kurisu walks into the lounge with a satisfied look on her face. It’s just her, me, and Suzuha in the lab. I had Daru and Mayuri head to Radi-Kan, ostensibly to work on the time machine.
Suzuha: "So that’s the Time Leap Machine..."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha gazes at the now-complete machine in awe. I’ve already explained to her how time leaping works. It’s as different as can be from Suzuha’s time machine, which can physically displace actual bodies.
Suzuha: "It makes you remember the future, right? That’s pretty interesting."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha crosses her hands behind her head and looks up at the ceiling.
Suzuha: "Intuition... sixth sense... deja vu... I wonder if those things are actually you recalling future memories. Some of SERN’s researchers in my time came up with the theory that memories are a way of sharing information across worldlines. Maybe it’s similar to that."
Kurisu: "I just wish we knew more about Okabe’s Reading Steiner thing. Is it unique to Okabe? Or does everyone have the potential for it, and Okabe’s is just stronger by coincidence?"
Rintaro: "One thing’s for certain. My consciousness leaps to the past along with my memories."
Kurisu: "I still don’t understand why that is. It would make more sense if you experienced a change in the present, like you do when we send a D-Mail. Does your consciousness depend on your memories?"
Suzuha: "The problem is that consciousness doesn’t have a form that we can see. Same goes for the soul. Those things are still in the realm of religion. Even in 2036, the existence of the soul hasn’t been proven, and nobody’s proven what forms consciousness, either."
Kurisu: "I see... that’s a little disappointing."
Rintaro: "Sending my consciousness back has let me change some future events with more precision than D-Mail, but other events are locked in by convergence."
