Suzuha: So that's what it is...
Mayuri: And you know, Suzu-san has lots of stories about future Okarin and future Chris-chan, but not a single story about Daru-kun, right?
Itaru: There weren't any about Mayu-shi either.
UNSPOKEN: Daru's observation startles me. It's an obvious thing to wonder about, but it strikes too close to home.
Mayuri: Well, Mayushii's a lab mem, but I can't make time machines, and I don't like fighting. Of course I'm not famous!
UNSPOKEN: ...No. The reason there aren't any stories about Mayuri is because she dies in a few hours. Only Kurisu, Suzuha, and I know that, and we say nothing.
Mayuri: But Daru-kun's a super hacka and Okarin's right arm. He even helped Okarin make PhoneWave-chan. So I thought it was strange Suzu-san didn't know him.
Kurisu: So you're saying he used a different name?
Mayuri: Barrel Titor-san helped Okarin found the Resistance, right? And he was in Akiba in 2010. And he was able to build his own time machine. And he knew about Okarin's Reading Spaghetti--
Rintaro: Reading Steiner.
Mayuri: He knew about it. Doesn't that fit Daru-kun perfectly?
Kurisu: She's right.
Mayuri: Do you remember the day Suzu-san went to meet her father? She thought he would be at the time machine offline meet.
UNSPOKEN: We know that because we tailed her.
Mayuri: Daru-kun was supposed to be there too, right?
Itaru: That meet was seriously important to the history of Japanese SciFi. At least I got to sneak in while tailing Amane-shi.
UNSPOKEN: I don't remember that. It must have happened because of the D-Mail I sent. This is the curse of Reading Steiner. Although I keep my memories from previous worldlines, I don't acquire memories of events on new worldlines.
Suzuha: Dad told me about that meet when I was little. I don't remember what he said exactly, but I thought I might be able to meet him there.
Itaru: So if I'd been at the meet, everything would've been okay?
Suzuha: Hmm, I don't know. I don't think I'd have picked you out as my dad.
UNSPOKEN: Still, the evidence keeps piling up.
Mayuri: And then there's the time machine's name, FG204 something something... umm, what was it?
Suzuha: FG204 2nd EDITION ver. 2. 31.
Rintaro: Th-that naming sense... it's got to be Daru!
Mayuri: And FG probably stands for Future Gadget.
UNSPOKEN: So Suzuha's time machine... is Future Gadget No. 204!?
Mayuri: Finally, his name. Barrel Titor has to be Daru-kun!
Kurisu: Come to think of it, last night, Mayuri asked how to say 'barrel' in Japanese.
Mayuri: Barrel is 'taru' in Japanese. Right, Chris-chan?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu nods.
Rintaro: Taru... Taru... Daru!?
Suzuha: It's a pun!?
Mayuri: Okay, Suzu-san! Say 'Hashida Itaru' ten times fast!
