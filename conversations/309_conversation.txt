Mayuri: Just now, didn't it sound like 'Ditor'?
Kurisu: It did.
Mayuri: Hashidaitaru. Hashi-daita-ru. Hashi-Ditor-ru. Hashi-Titor-ru.
Itaru: ...For reals?
Mayuri: For super reals♪
UNSPOKEN: I can't believe it. But with all this evidence laid out in front of me, I can't deny it either. Everyone's jaw drops again, only this time we're staring at Daru and Suzuha.
Mayuri: I think she looks just like her father♪
Kurisu: That could just be the placebo effect... but now that you mention it, they kinda do look alike.
Rintaro: Nice work, Mayuri! You'll make a great detective one day.
Mayuri: A d-detective? Ehehe! That's the first time anyone's said that.
UNSPOKEN: She's such a ditz most of the time, but maybe she's more perceptive than anyone knows.
Itaru: My... d-daughter? Amane-shi is my daughter?
UNSPOKEN: Daru, wide-eyed, points at Suzuha while flapping his lips like a fish out of water.
Suzuha: Dad...
Itaru: Uh... c-c-could you call me Papa instead?
Kurisu: For once in your life, don't be a perv...
Suzuha: Dad...!
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha tries to hold back her tears, but can't.  They fall from her eyes and roll down her cheeks. Seeing this, Daru stops his joking and lets Suzuha speak.
Suzuha: I came, Dad. I came to see you... in the time machine you built.
Itaru: Yeah...
Suzuha: I'm going to finish what you started. I promise.
Itaru: Yeah...
Suzuha: Watch over me. Okay?
Itaru: I'm watching. Of course I am!
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha walks up to Daru and hugs him gently. Daru awkwardly, but firmly, hugs her back. Father and daughter, reunited across time. I'm truly glad we could bring them together.
Itaru: B-by the way, was your mother cute? Request petite girl with cute face and big boobs.
Suzuha: Ahaha. That's a secret.
UNSPOKEN: When Suzuha finally steps away from Daru, she's smiling once again.
Suzuha: Well! That takes care of everything I wanted to do on this worldline. Guess I should be going.
Rintaro: W-wait! You're going already? Don't you have more to say to your father?
UNSPOKEN: What am I doing? Suzuha's mind is set. I know that nothing I can say will convince her to stay. It's madness to even try. If she stays, Mayuri dies. I know that! So why am I trying to stop her?
Suzuha: No, I'm fine now. I'm going to get an IBN 5100, just like I promised.
UNSPOKEN: She looks at us with the face of a warrior.
Suzuha: I'll bring it to you here in Akihabara. That's my duty, and I'll see it through. The rest is up to you. Change the future. Please.
