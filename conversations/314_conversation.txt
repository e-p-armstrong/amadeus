Rintaro: Daru... didn't you fix the time machine?
Itaru: I... I did... I thought I did... but I mean, that was my first time repairing a time machine. I might have missed something.
Rintaro: Missed something!? Whatever you missed cost your daughter 24 years of her life!
Itaru: I didn't do it on purpose!
Kurisu: Calm down, both of you. Hashida did everything he could. He doesn't deserve your anger, Okabe.
Rintaro: How can you be so calm!?
Kurisu: That's how I am. Sorry. Now calm down.
Rintaro: Gh...
UNSPOKEN: It's not Daru's fault. I know that. But it can't end like this. It can't! What was Suzuha feeling as she wrote this letter? I look again at the words scrawled upon the page, every character resonant with despair. I wanted to welcome her back with a smile. Instead... this. Suzuha is dead, ten years gone. ...Wait. How did she die? Don't tell me... Mister Braun must know what happened. I run to the window and check the street. Mister Braun is outside, closing up shop.
Rintaro: Mister Braun!
UNSPOKEN: I run downstairs.
Tennouji: Okabe! Did you hear? That satellite up and disappeared. Everyone's talking about it.
UNSPOKEN: I guess it's already made the news.
Rintaro: Please... I need to know.
Tennouji: Huh? Know what?
Rintaro: Hashida Suzu-san... how did she die?
