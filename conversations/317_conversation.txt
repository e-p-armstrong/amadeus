UNSPOKEN: After catching his breath, Daru speaks.
Itaru: "My daughter is 30 years older than me. I don’t know if I want to see that. Feels weird, man."
Kurisu: "You know, it wouldn’t be unusual for her to have grandchildren by that age."
Itaru: "Y-you mean I could have great-grandkids? I don’t know if I’m ready for that, man..."
Mayuri: "Just be super nice to them! That’s what grandpas do!"
Itaru: "Please, don’t call me grandpa..."
UNSPOKEN: A knock on the door interrupts their idle chatter. It must be Suzuha! Everyone looks at me. With a strange mixture of anticipation and anxiety, I slowly open the door.
Tennouji: "Okabe!"
UNSPOKEN: Instead of an old woman, we get a wall of muscle. Our disappointment is palpable.
Rintaro: "Oh, it’s you..."
Tennouji: "Hey, have you seen my part-timer?"
UNSPOKEN: Mister Braun peeks into the lab.
Mayuri: "If you’re looking for Suzu-san, she went 35 years--"
Kurisu: "Shaddup, Mayuri!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu covers Mayuri’s mouth.
Tennouji: "You know something? Where’d that girl run off to? She took the last couple days off and I don’t know when she’s coming next. She won’t even answer her phone."
UNSPOKEN: We don’t have time for this, but I can’t just order him to leave. Not unless I want another cracked skull.
Rintaro: "She said she went back to her hometown. She’s probably gone for good."
Tennouji: "What!? You sure? That brat. She didn’t say a word to me."
UNSPOKEN: The future is changing. Isn’t this proof? On my previous leaps, Mister Braun never came by the lab. This must be related to Suzuha’s trip to 1975. Surely it’s a good sign. Now, as long as the attractor field doesn’t amend history again... Mister Braun sighs, then turns to me with a serious expression.
Tennouji: "Well, whatever. I’ve got something for you, Okabe."
Rintaro: "...For me?"
UNSPOKEN: He hands me an envelope. It’s addressed to Okabe Rintaro, but there’s no stamp or postmark. The name Hashida Suzu is written on the back.
Rintaro: "What is this?"
