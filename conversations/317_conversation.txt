UNSPOKEN: Daru's right. I've probably looked out the window 20 times in the past hour. And not a suspicious figure in sight. Moeka's men still haven't appeared. The raid was before 8, if I remember correctly. I think it's safe to say that my changes to the past have prevented it from occurring. Suzuha's sacrifice was not in vain. I let out a deep breath. I'm sweaty and disgusting. It's like my anxiety has pushed all the sweat out of my body.
Rintaro: Mayuri. Kurisu.
UNSPOKEN: The two girls woke up from their nap about half an hour ago. Now they're eating cup noodles.
Kurisu: Wait... did you just say my name correctly?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks at me in astonishment, like she can't believe her ears.
Rintaro: When you're done eating, go home. It's late, so I'll go with you.
Mayuri: Okeydokey!
Kurisu: I don't need an escort from you. I can get back by myself.
Rintaro: Just listen. Daru, you too.
Itaru: Huh? Me too?
UNSPOKEN: The train lines running through Akihabara are operating normally. There's no bomb scare, and no sign of Moeka or her men. Kurisu's taking the Sobu Line to the next station, Ochanomizu, while Daru's going the opposite way to Shin-Koiwa. Mayuri and I are taking the Yamanote Line to Ikebukuro, so we part at the station's ticket gate. There are surprisingly few passengers on the train. I guess most of the salarymen are off for the Obon holiday. Mayuri is playing a handheld game - the RaiNet Kakeru action RPG. On the screen, her character is battling a gigantic Upa. I stand beside her and gaze at her profile, lost in thought. It's the night of the 13th, and Mayuri's still alive. How many times have I watched her die? How many times have I tasted that despair? No matter what I did, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't save this ditzy childhood friend of mine from death. She died again and again, right before my eyes. But now, she's alive. Standing beside me, playing a game. This is why I sacrificed our memories with Suzuha. It was the only way. I'm sorry, Suzuha. And thank you. Suzuha no longer exists in this time, but I hope my feelings will reach her all the same. ...Actually, come to think of it, why can't I tell her in person? Where in Akiba could the 54-year-old Suzuha be? I'll try asking Tennouji tomorrow. He probably knows Suzuha on this worldline too. I wonder if Suzuha remembers me.
Mayuri: ...Hey, Okarin?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri suddenly lifts her head. She looks at me hesitantly. Her cheeks are slightly pink.
Rintaro: What?
Mayuri: Come on, Okarin... Mayushii gets nervous when you stare at her like that...
