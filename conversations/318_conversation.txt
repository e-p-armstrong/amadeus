UNSPOKEN: Mayuri comes out of the ticket gate and walks up to me with a unhurried stride.
Mayuri: Tutturu♪ I didn't think you'd come all the way to the station to pick me up. Mayushii's surprised!
Rintaro: I wouldn't want my hostage to get away.
Mayuri: Yeah, me neither! So, Mayushii's really happy. Ehehe♪
UNSPOKEN: I don't quite understand... but whatever. Mayuri flashes a carefree smile, then walks ahead of me, almost skipping.
Mayuri: So what's in the bag?
Rintaro: Mister Braun gave it to me. It's a device that can measure the divergence of worldlines.
Mayuri: Wow, that sounds amazing... what's a worldline?
UNSPOKEN: I smile wryly.
Rintaro: Mayuri, you really are a dummy.
UNSPOKEN: What am I doing? After I left Tennouji's house, I called Mayuri to ask when she would arrive in Akiba. Then, I went to the station to pick her up. Anxiety still smolders in my heart. We managed to survive yesterday, but that doesn't guarantee our safety forever. It's entirely possible for Moeka to attack now, on the afternoon of the 14th. Maybe I'm being overprotective, but I still can't shake the image of Mayuri's death from my mind. I don't ever want to have to go through that again.
Rintaro: Just a thought, Mayuri, but don't you think maybe you should stop coming to Akiba for a while? At least until ComiMa ends.
UNSPOKEN: No response. I look to the side.
Rintaro: Mayuri!?
UNSPOKEN: Panicked, I scan the area and catch sight of her wandering towards a newly-opened shaved ice stand. That ditz... Can't she tell how worried I am?
Kurisu: So you're the devoted type, huh?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu is glaring at me with an ice coffee in her hand. We're in the lab, which appears to have become her second home.
Rintaro: What's that supposed to mean?
UNSPOKEN: I'm sitting at the computer, searching for intel on the IBN 5100. I still don't know where it is. I went to Yanabayashi Shrine this morning, but alas, it wasn't there. Suzuha promised to get one to us somehow. Her gift to us from 1975. Without it, we can't hack into SERN's database, meaning we can't achieve divergence over 1%.
Kurisu: All of a sudden, you're treating Mayuri like a princess. Today you went to the station to meet her, you taste tested her lunch, and then you held her hand all the way back to the lab.
Mayuri: Okarin really loves Mayushii! Ehehe!
UNSPOKEN: Did she have to tell Kurisu, of all people? Mayuri looks so carefree as she stuffs her cheeks with takoyaki. I'm pretty sure she's smiling not because of my love, but because of the takoyaki's deliciousness. Typical Mayuri. But seriously, did you have to tell Kurisu?
Kurisu: So what's the deal?
Rintaro: I don't follow.
