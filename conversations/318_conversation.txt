UNSPOKEN: Suzu-san? Suzu-san... Of course! The name on the back reads Hashida Suzu. Hashida is Daru’s surname!
Rintaro: "Where is she now!?"
Tennouji: "Huh? Uh, she passed away ten years ago."
Rintaro: "Passed away!?"
UNSPOKEN: She’s dead!? A wave of dizziness nearly sweeps me off my feet.
Rintaro: "...How old was she?"
Tennouji: "Mid-forties, I think."
UNSPOKEN: The age fits.
Rintaro: "Thank you for taking care of this letter, Mister Braun."
Mayuri: "Eh? Eh? Is it from Suzu-san?"
Itaru: "Seriously? Why did he have it?"
UNSPOKEN: Mister Braun clearly doesn’t understand our reaction, and we’re not about to explain. I thank him again. He grumbles a bit and leaves. As soon as he’s gone, I break the seal and open the envelope. Inside is a handwritten letter. The characters are slightly messy, as if her hand was shaking as she wrote it. Our eyes, transfixed, begin to read.
Suzuha: "Dear Okabe Rintaro, It’s me, Amane Suzuha. Hashida Titor’s daughter. It’s been a long time. Though for you, I’m sure only a few hours have passed. The date is June 13th, the year 2000. Meaning I’m writing this ten years before you will read it. I’ll get right to the point. I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed"
UNSPOKEN: I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed 
Suzuha: "I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed"
UNSPOKEN: I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed 
Suzuha: "The date is June 14th, the year 2000. About nine or ten years before you will read this. I failed. I only remembered who I was one year ago today. The day Nostradamus said the King of Terror would come. Stupid, stupid, King of Terror. He should have come and burned us all away. For 24 years, I forgot who I was. All I could remember was my name. I finally remembered one year ago. The day the King of Terror was supposed to come but didn’t. There’s no King of Terror, but I want to die. The repairs were incomplete. The time machine malfunctioned. When I arrived in 1975, I couldn’t remember anything. They found me lying in the street like a broken doll and took me to a hospital. Now I’ve been living on my own for years, but that’s as Hashida Suzu, a normal person who forgot the duty and mission of Amane Suzuha I only remembered last year. I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed"
UNSPOKEN: I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I’m a failure
Suzuha: "Something went wrong! I don’t know what. The repairs were incomplete. But it’s not Dad’s fault, it’s mine. I should have gone straight to 1975. I shouldn’t have stopped in 2010, but I was selfish and now the future is doomed. There’s no IBN 5100. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. For what purpose have I lived to this age? I forgot my duty and lived a carefree life instead. Now my life has no meaning at all. It’s worthless. Worthless. Worthless. I wish I hadn’t remembered. I’m glad I finally remembered. I’m glad I had this chance to say sorry. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me, forgive me! My plan failed. I spent this whole year asking myself why. I finally figured it out. If I hadn’t postponed my leap to 1975, this wouldn’t have happened. Okabe Rintaro. After the offline meet, you stopped me from going to 1975. I was really happy, but that’s where it all went wrong. I should have left. I shouldn’t have waited. That was my last chance. That night, there was a thunderstorm. My time machine was flooded. If you can go back to that day, please, please, let me leave. Then, I can bring you the IBN 5100. I can fulfill my mission. Please. That’s all I want. I promised Dad. This was his dream. I want to change the future. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. My life was meaningless."
