Rintaro: Do we look like a couple?
Kurisu: Huh!? Uh... well... umm...
UNSPOKEN: Just what sort of delusions does this girl have?
Mayuri: You know, Okarin and Mayushii have been friends since we were littleâ™ª Mwawoohii's weeally hwawy nawo.
Rintaro: Don't talk with your mouth full.
Kurisu: So... you're not a couple. Oh. Well, of course! No one would willingly date Okabe, after all.
Rintaro: Pff. You disappoint me, Christina!
Kurisu: Hah? What are you talking about?
Rintaro: You have finally revealed your true nature. I saw how your eyes lit up at the first hint of romance! You're nothing but a filthy mainstream girl! I bet you like to eat chocolate with your girlfriends and giggle about the latest celebrity love affair! Absurd! This lab has no need of the puppies and flowers in your head!
UNSPOKEN: It feels strange to be spewing this chuunibyou nonsense again, after what I've been through. Gh, is my innocence lost forever?
Kurisu: What the hell are you on about, you self-proclaimed mad scientist chuunibyou nutcase?
UNSPOKEN: It's been a long time since I argued with Kurisu like this too. The thought brings a sudden pang of loneliness. After failing to save Mayuri, I sought help from this genius girl. Even though her words were at times harsh, she supported and encouraged me to the end. But now, all of that has vanished along with the time we spent with Suzuha. Thank you for your help, Kurisu. I silently give her my sincere gratitude. I finish typing on the X68000's keyboard and sigh, then turn to the divergence meter sitting on the shelf. The display reads 0. 409431%. What does that mean?
Suzuha: The universe is like this piece of yarn. Countless possible worldlines exist side by side, branching out to infinity. When the meter reads over 1%, you've made it to the Beta worldline. If you escape the Alpha attractor field and reach the Beta worldline... then the result will change. Reach 1% divergence... and you'll save Shiina Mayuri.
