UNSPOKEN: Kurisu demands answers. I can see the fear in her eyes.
Rintaro: "We can’t just leave it like this! I have to do something!"
Kurisu: "Okabe..."
Mayuri: "But Okarin, are you sure?"
UNSPOKEN: Don’t try to stop me, Mayuri. I can’t let this stand. There are two options. I can cancel the D-Mail that convinced me to pursue Suzuha. Sending a contradictory D-Mail should do the trick. Or I can time leap again and prevent Suzuha from leaving. Two options... but really, just one. Do not hesitate, Okabe Rintaro. Hesitation is unforgivable. You already know what you must do. Stop pursuit last mail is SERN trap That should be enough to convince me to let Suzuha go.
Rintaro: "Kurisu. You’re good at remembering dates, aren’t you?"
Kurisu: "Huh? Well, sure..."
Rintaro: "When did we throw that party for Suzuha?"
Kurisu: "Four days ago. August 9th."
Mayuri: "You’re sending a D-Mail, Okarin? But won’t that make everything disappear?"
UNSPOKEN: Four days. It may not sound like much, but in that time, we forged a definite bond with Suzuha. To send this D-Mail is to sever that bond. I know that. I know that! But this is the only choice I have. I set the PhoneWave to 97 hours ago. This D-Mail should arrive a few hours after the first. Now I just need to send it. Save Mayuri -- that is my purpose. That is what drove me to leap through time. I’ll do whatever it takes to save her. This is just one more sacrifice. Erase the time you spent with Suzuha! Destroy whatever bond you had! Send the D-Mail! Push the button! Isn’t that what Suzuha wants? You’ll be saving her from twenty-five years of loneliness, from ending her life in utter despair. Save Suzuha. Save Mayuri. This is the right thing to do. This... Is right! ...But is it really? Is erasing those memories really the right thing to do? Isn’t that just running away from reality? Shouldn’t I try time leaping first? Maybe there’s another way. What should I do? What’s the right choice? Stop. You’re starting to doubt. Never doubt! I don’t know the answer. But I need to reach a conclusion, or else. I... I start up the microwave. The discharge begins immediately. I place my thumb on the send button.
Mayuri: "Are you sure!?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri’s voice is choked with tears.
Mayuri: "Our memories with Suzu-san will disappear! Is that really okay?"
UNSPOKEN: Memories flash through my head.
Suzuha: "Being with you guys, even for just a little while... was great. I’m going to finish what you started, Dad. I promise. Well, see you in 35 years... though I guess it’ll only be a few hours for you guys. Ahaha! Change the future. Please."
