UNSPOKEN: Kurisu enters the development room.
Kurisu: Didn't you say we weren't going to experiment with the Time Leap Machine?
Rintaro: This is just in case.
Kurisu: In case what?
UNSPOKEN: I don't want to answer that. I keep praying that my fears will not be realized. It's okay. Everything will be okay. They didn't attack yesterday, so they won't attack today. At the very least, we've changed Mayuri's fate. But still, I can't help but pray. Please let Mayuri be safe. Please don't let anything happen. My prayers... Go unanswered. The door slams open. Five men burst into the lab. I recognize them -- the Rounders. They aim their guns at us. I freeze. Despair seizes my heart. My worst fears have come true. It's happening exactly the same as before. Only this time, Suzuha isn't here to save us.
Attacker A: Hands in the air. Nobody move.
UNSPOKEN: Even the dark-skinned man's words are the same. Eventually, the unpleasant clack of heels echoes down the hallway.
Mayuri: Um... Moeka-san?
