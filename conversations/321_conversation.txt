UNSPOKEN: I ignore her and bite down hard on my lip. As the taste of blood fills my mouth, I press the button. The world shatters into geometric shapes that expand and contract like rubber toys. Light gathers between my eyes. Stars explode behind my eyelids. Gradually, color returns to the world.
Rintaro: "Ah!"
UNSPOKEN: I wait for the vertigo to pass. Cold sweat oozes from my temples. Pressing my fists against them, I slowly force the air out of my lungs. Has the worldline changed? I head to the lounge in order to check the divergence meter.
Rintaro: "It’s gone..."
UNSPOKEN: I checked the meter a few minutes ago, just before the worldline changed. Now it’s nowhere to be found. I quickly realize what has happened. Suzuha gave me the meter after we stopped her from leaving. My D-Mail undid those events. Of course the meter isn’t here. A surge of regret seizes my heart. I clench my teeth and endure it as best I can. If nobody else remembers, then I alone will keep these memories of Suzuha alive. I look around the room. Mayuri and Kurisu are on the sofa, dozing on each other’s shoulders. Daru, oblivious to the vulnerable high school girls behind him, is playing an eroge on his computer. I take a deep breath and turn on the TV. I flip to a news channel. The worldline should have changed. I erased the time we spent with Suzuha. That should have allowed her to leap to 1975 without losing her memories, and the IBN 5100 should be in our hands now. We can use it to hack into SERN and erase the data they intercepted from us. Without that information, Moeka’s men won’t attack the lab. Mayuri won’t have to die. That’s how it should be. That’s how it has to be. Otherwise, why did I sacrifice Suzuha’s dream? The quickest way to confirm the change would be to check for any delays at Akihabara Station.
Rintaro: "Daru, is the Yamanote Line stopped?"
Itaru: "Huh? Uh... I don’t think so?"
Rintaro: "Check online."
Itaru: "Wait, I’m at the best part."
Rintaro: "Please."
UNSPOKEN: Daru sighs and calls up train information.
Itaru: "Hmm, doesn’t look stopped."
Rintaro: "Thanks."
