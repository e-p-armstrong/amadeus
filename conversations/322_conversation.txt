UNSPOKEN: I lead her out of the lab. We sit on the bench in front of the building. Suzuha's bicycle is still absent.
Kurisu: What is it? You don't normally say my name normally.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu frowns at her own words.
Kurisu: That came out weird.
Rintaro: Please... help me.
Kurisu: ...Now this is a shock. I never thought I'd hear those words from you. Do you have a fever?
Rintaro: No jokes. I seriously need your help.
Kurisu: You time leaped, didn't you?
UNSPOKEN: I nod.
Rintaro: How much do you know?
Kurisu: How much do I know about what?
Rintaro: How about Suzuha being John Titor?
Kurisu: Eh!?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu gives me a blank stare.
Kurisu: It never even occurred to me.
UNSPOKEN: When we prevented Suzuha from leaving on August 9th, she ended up staying until August 13th. But that outcome was changed by my last D-Mail. What happened during those four days on this worldline?
Rintaro: Have you finished the Time Leap Machine?
Kurisu: What are you talking about? I finished it yesterday after an all-nighter, remember? When did you leap from?
Rintaro: 8 PM tonight.
UNSPOKEN: It looks like I'll have to explain everything all over again.
Kurisu: Hmmm...
UNSPOKEN: I told her about Mayuri's many deaths, and about what happened with Suzuha and Moeka. I also gave a summary of what Suzuha told me about the structure of the universe. Kurisu does not appear to doubt my story.
Kurisu: So basically, you win if you get the IBN 5100 back.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu sums up what I told her.
Kurisu: This is just a guess... But maybe you should look at what Amane-san said from the opposite angle. I think the critical change takes place when you get the IBN 5100 and erase the data in SERN's database. That instant is most likely when you'll achieve divergence over 1%.
Rintaro: The problem is where the IBN 5100 is now.
Kurisu: You've already found it once. That is, if your memories are real. If you can get back to the worldline where you first obtained it, then isn't it bound to return to you?
Rintaro: I see... You're right. The IBN 5100 was at the lab, and then it suddenly disappeared.
Kurisu: You threw a fit about that earlier. I remember thinking, 'Oh god, Okabe's finally lost his ability to distinguish fantasy from reality.'
Rintaro: You're such a wannabe American. What do you mean, 'oh god'? Oh, I get it. Chris-chan is a Chris-tian.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks at me in disdain as soon as those words leave my lips.
Kurisu: That's terrible.
Rintaro: ...I regret it too.
UNSPOKEN: This is no time for puns.
Rintaro: So, Christina... let me see if I understand what you're saying. The changes we made to the worldline -- namely, all of the D-Mails we've sent -- must be reversed. That will return us to the worldline where I found the IBN 5100 at Yanabayashi Shrine.
