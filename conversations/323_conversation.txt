Mayuri: "Yeah."
Rintaro: "Sorry about that."
UNSPOKEN: I apologize, but keep looking at her. Instead of starting a new game, Mayuri looks at me with concern.
Mayuri: "There’s something different about you today, Okarin."
Rintaro: "R-really?"
Mayuri: "Yeah. What’s wrong?"
UNSPOKEN: I remind myself that Mayuri is more perceptive than she seems. She proved that when she figured out that Daru was Suzuha’s father. I don’t want to worry her too much. I want Mayuri to smile her usual ditzy smile without a care in the world. After all, it’s over now. She’s safe.
Rintaro: "Heh. Nothing’s wrong! And I wasn’t looking at you just now. I was devising new ways to bring chaos to the world. Muhahaha!"
Mayuri: "Really? You seem kind of tired."
Rintaro: "A mad scientist is never tired. The mighty gray cells of my 170-IQ brain are always performing calculations, day and night!"
Mayuri: "Oh... but you should still take a break every now and then. Please, Okarin. For me?"
UNSPOKEN: Having said that, Mayuri returns to her game. I feel cold stares all around me, but I don’t care at all. Mayuri is here with me, doing everyday Mayuri things. Ordinary things. Everything is going back to normal. Yesterday was my first time home in a while, so I slept like a log in my comfortable bed. It could be because of my mental exhaustion, but that was my best night’s sleep in a while. Before heading up to the lab, I stop and stare at the Braun Tube Workshop. The familiar mountain bike is gone. Suzuha liked it so much, she insisted on bringing it with her to 1975. The workshop door opens and out comes Mister Braun, rubbing his eyes sleepily.
Tennouji: "Okabe! You’ve got free time. How about a job? As a special offer, I’ll hire you for one CRT a month."
UNSPOKEN: One CRT a month? So for one month’s work, I get an old television? Hell no.
Rintaro: "When did Suzuha quit, again?"
Tennouji: "Suzuha? Who the hell’s that?"
UNSPOKEN: What!? Was her existence erased completely? But that’s impossible.
Tennouji: "I ain’t got time to remember the name of some lazy part-timer who quit after just ten days."
Rintaro: "Damn you and your misleading words..."
