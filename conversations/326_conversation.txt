Rintaro: W-whoa! What!?
UNSPOKEN: She smells good. Faris's cat ears tickle my nose. I go stiff, not knowing what to do about this sudden turn of events. Faris looks up at me. She looks so desperate. I feel my heart pound faster.
Faris: Is it a real time machine, nya?
Rintaro: ...Yeah. It's real.
UNSPOKEN: Faris stares at me even more intensely, like she's trying to see inside my soul.
Faris: I believe you, nyan.
UNSPOKEN: Just when I get the feeling she believed me way too easily, she suddenly starts clutching her head.
Faris: Ugh... ugh... I'm about to remember, nya.
Rintaro: Huh?
Faris: Faris remembers using the time machine, nyan.
Rintaro: Wha... Really!?
Faris: Umm, Faris got on the time machine and it went zoom and...
Rintaro: What? But you didn't ride anything, you sent a D-Mail to the past.
Faris: Nyanya! That's it, nya, I'm starting to remember more and more, nya.
UNSPOKEN: Faris then holds her head and looks at me with tears in her eyes.
Faris: My head... hurts, nya.
Rintaro: What's going on here?
UNSPOKEN: Does Faris have Reading Steiner too? I don't know. I need to find out, but how? Calm down. I need to think. Should I contact Kurisu? Or should I...
Faris: Kyouma... Faris is... Faris is...
UNSPOKEN: Faris continues to cling to me. And all I can do is hold her warm, soft, slender body in my arms. I need to make her remember somehow.
Faris: My brains are turning to mush, nya...
Rintaro: Hang in there! Is there anything I can do?
Faris: If I win... If I win, I might remember, nya.
Rintaro: Win? Win what?
Faris: Today's match, nyan. Against the Viral Attackers, nya. I only lost because of their underhanded tricks, nya. And now my head is all mushy, so I can't remember anything, nya. Please, Kyouma... I think that if I win the match, I'll remember everything, nya. So please, nyan, let me use the time machine.
Rintaro: By the way, this isn't an act, right?
Faris: A-an act? What do you mean, nya?
UNSPOKEN: Don't tell me she just wants to use the time machine to win her RaiNet match? Considering her personality, that's actually pretty likely. After all, this is a girl who twists men around her finger.
Faris: You're awful, nya.
UNSPOKEN: And then Faris starts crying into my chest.
Faris: Even though Faris is trying her bestest to remember for you... You called me a liar... it hurts, nyan.
Rintaro: Ah, no, I'm sorry.
UNSPOKEN: Tears emerge from the corners of her eyes. I have no idea what to do in this situation. Judging by her tears, I don't think she's lying. But there's really no basis to the theory that she'll remember if she wins the RaiNet tournament.
Faris: Please, nya...
UNSPOKEN: Faris whispers into my ear.
Faris: Help Faris win, nyan...
