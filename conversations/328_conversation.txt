Rintaro: I waited here because I wanted to see you.
Faris: Hanya!? A-are you confessing your love for me? I don't know what to do if you confess right before such an important match, nyan!
Rintaro: D-don't be ridiculous! Why would I confess to you?
Faris: ...You're awfully serious today, nya. Usually you play along more, nya.
UNSPOKEN: I don't have time to be Hououin Kyouma now.
Faris: I'm nervous about the finals, so I want to lift my spirits, nyan.
UNSPOKEN: She doesn't look nervous.
Rintaro: Please just listen to me, Faris! This is important for your victory.
Faris: Important? But you don't even know the rules of RaiNet, nya?
Rintaro: It's not about the rules or anything like that.
Faris: Then what is it, nya?
UNSPOKEN: She peers at me with questioning eyes. I'd better give her the goods before I screw this up.
Rintaro: Take these with you.
UNSPOKEN: I try handing over the sunglasses and earplugs I bought on the way here. But Faris pulls back, as if on guard.
Faris: Kyouma... that's lame, nya...
UNSPOKEN: How rude!
Faris: You're supposed to bring nicer presents, like--
Rintaro: It's not a present. These are countermeasures!
Faris: Nya?
Rintaro: Listen good. I came from the future.
Faris: I know, nya.
Rintaro: What!?
UNSPOKEN: She knows? How!? Why!?
Faris: And Faris came from space, nya.
UNSPOKEN: Don't forget, this is Faris NyanNyan we're dealing with.
Rintaro: I'm not joking around here! I seriously leapt here from six this evening! I know the outcome of today's RaiNet GC final.
Faris: Don't tell me. Overwhelming victory for Faris--
Rintaro: No. You lose.
Faris: Nyau...
UNSPOKEN: Faris frowns.
Rintaro: But that's only because of the opposing team's interference. So to protect you, I brought you these sunglasses and earplugs.
UNSPOKEN: I desperately try to convince her, but Faris just hangs her head, making it hard to read her expression.
Rintaro: Are you listening!?
UNSPOKEN: I grab Faris's slender shoulders. She's shaking.
Rintaro: Faris?
Faris: Unyaaaaa! Kyouma, you meanie!
UNSPOKEN: And then she suddenly explodes!
Faris: This is a very important match for Faris, nya! How dare you say I'll lose nya! You're being mean! Are you a Viral Attackers spy, nya!?
Rintaro: N-no, look, it wasn't your fault you lost. It's--
Faris: Hmya! Not listenyan!
Rintaro: Hgg...!
UNSPOKEN: After a swift kick to my shin, Faris turns her back to me in a huff. Damn you, catgirl! For once in your life, listen to me!
Rintaro: W-wait! I said wait! I need you to win, no matter what!
Faris: Like I said, there's no way I can lose, nya! And I don't wannya wear those ugly glasses, nya! Faris needs to be cute at every moment! My fans are counting on me, nya!
