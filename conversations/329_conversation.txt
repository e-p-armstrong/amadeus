Rintaro: Please hear me out!
UNSPOKEN: Bearing the pain in my shin, I force my way in front of Faris and stand in her way.
Rintaro: Faris, please. Mayuri's life depends on it!
Faris: Someone! Someone come here, nya! Help me, nyan!
UNSPOKEN: Faris suddenly starts shouting. She grabs the attention of the surrounding participants and spectators. Even staff members are gathering. Crap, I can't talk about time machines or Mayuri's life with this much attention around us. But unless I can get Faris to listen to me, there's no way I can undo her D-Mail. What should I do?
4℃: You seem to have an awful lot of time on your hands. Eh, Champion?
UNSPOKEN: That smug voice. A tall man dressed entirely in black walks up to us with a grin on his face. Whenever he takes a step, all of his silver accessories jingle. He dramatically takes off his sunglasses, revealing the face of that guy who gave me trouble before. If I'm not mistaken, he called himself 4℃ or something like that.
4℃: Heh. Swooping down unto the street, I am the black peacock of the RaiNetter realm. The name's 4℃. That's Shido, you get me? I'm the leader of the Viral Attackers.
Faris: The Viral Attackers...
UNSPOKEN: Hm? The Viral Attackers. I think I've heard that name somewhere before... That's right! They're Faris's opponents this match! They're trying to start a fight now. This is a guy who headbutts people out of nowhere. And he seems to hate Faris, for some reason.
4℃: Seriously, you disappoint me, Champion. You flirt with the system, but that's just noise to my heart. And yet here you are, before the match, soaking in the corrupted love of that worthless man. You put on the airs of a siamese cat, but with this duel today, I'll dye that white fur of yours jet black. Gaia has thus whispered. The black cat is the sign of disaster. My black radiance shall outshine your shadow, ushering in a new generation of RaiNet. Women are already slaves to the living Rock Mind that is myself.
UNSPOKEN: Damn, this guy can talk. Though I have no idea what he's saying. Faris seems to be thinking the same thing.
Faris: Why is everyone getting in Faris's way, nya? I can't hear myself think, nya!
UNSPOKEN: With that said, she quickly tries to enter the hall. But I grab her hand to detain her.
Rintaro: Faris, I told you to wait!
Faris: Paws off!
Rintaro: I'm begging you, please listen to what I'm saying!
4℃: Hey! Don't you dare disregard the man closest to the truth of RaiNet.
Rintaro: This is none of your business. Go away.
4℃: The hell you say! Don't you know I'm the black nobleman of the RaiNet realm!?
Rintaro: Weren't you the black peacock of the RaiNet realm? Get your story straight.
