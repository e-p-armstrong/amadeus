UNSPOKEN: I hear giggles from all around.
4℃: Heh! They're laughing at you, you corrupt pussy l'amant!
UNSPOKEN: What the hell is a l'amant?
Rintaro: I think not! They're laughing at you, you pathetic peacock with a bald spot on your head.
4℃: What!? How do you know about my untouchable black spot!? I've never told anyone about it!
UNSPOKEN: 4℃'s face turns red.
Rintaro: Elementary, 4℃ (YondoC). I am an insane mad scientist and traveler through time! Nothing escapes the sight of Hououin Kyouma.
4℃: The name's Shido! Now you've gone too far! For the sin of insulting my ultra-cool badass name, I'll summon you to my garden, the black HELL! Just you wait!
UNSPOKEN: He puts on his sunglasses and leaves. Consider this payback for the headbutt.
Faris: How did you know about 4℃'s weak point, nyan? Nobody's ever seen it.
Rintaro: Haven't you been listening? I came from the future.
Faris: Ah...
Rintaro: So please, Faris, take this stuff. Just hold on to it, okay?
Faris: B-but... there's no way Faris can lose, nya.
Rintaro: You're stronger than them, no question. But you heard him just now. They're obviously not gonna play fair. They'll do anything it takes to win, even if it breaks the RaiNetter code.
Faris: If you say so...
UNSPOKEN: Looks like my desperation paid off. Faris reluctantly accepts the two items I present to her. Of course, she doesn't take them out of the bag.
Faris: I'm just going to hold onto them. Is that okay, nya?
Rintaro: Yeah. Just make sure you have them with you on the stage. I promise you'll need them.
