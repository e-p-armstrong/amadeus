UNSPOKEN: Why is she getting mad at me? I just don’t understand her.
Kurisu: "I wish I could remember too... Then I’d always have something to rub your nose in!"
Rintaro: "You really have an awful personality."
Kurisu: "You’re one to talk."
UNSPOKEN: With that, I leap 28 hours into the past. Time leap complete. I’m standing in the lab, as usual. My brain feels like it’s been pinched. I endure the pain as I check my watch. It’s 1:47 PM. Kurisu’s almost done with the Time Leap Machine, and Mayuri’s almost done with Lukako’s costume. They should both be done in about 10 minutes. I leave the lab and sit on the bench in front of the Braun Tube Workshop. Let’s go over the plan. Cancel all the D-Mails that have changed the past so far. Of course, that includes D-Mails sent by people other than me. Specifically, I’m only concerned with the D-Mails that triggered Reading Steiner. We sent several of them as experiments. For example, Operation Urd Stage Two, the LOTO SIX experiment, involved one such D-Mail. But the real problem is what other people sent. Mayuri and Kurisu haven’t sent any D-Mails. Daru sent his past self a strategy to win the Faris Cup, but Reading Steiner didn’t activate, so divergence must not have changed. That leaves three D-Mails to deal with -- those sent by Moeka, Lukako, and Faris. The most problematic is the one Faris sent, which is also the most recent. I have no idea what it said, so I don’t know how to cancel it. Faris’s D-Mail caused a dramatic change to Akiba. All of the moe stores disappeared. That’s my only hint. I’m the only one who remembers how things were before the change, so I won’t get an answer from Faris, even if I ask her directly. But still, I have to at least try. I should get in touch with her. First, let’s try contacting her by phone or mail. Meeting face-to-face would be best, but MayQueen doesn’t exist on this worldline. Meaning I’d have to go to that high-class apartment complex. I should try contacting Faris first. I decide to call her. The ring tone echoes in my ears. It’s not connecting.
Rintaro: "Damn!"
