Rintaro: "Then where is she now?"
Butler: "I’m afraid I cannot answer that. You may be someone with whom she does not wish to interact."
Rintaro: "I’ve been here before, remember!?"
Butler: "Of course, sir. However, I still cannot disclose the location of the young mistress. Please contact her directly."
UNSPOKEN: He’s obviously trying to end the conversation, so I panic to get the last word in.
Rintaro: "P-please wait! I’ve been trying to get in touch with Faris, but she’s not returning my calls or emails!"
Butler: "Then please try again some other time."
Rintaro: "Guh!"
UNSPOKEN: Frustrated by this new turn of events, my anger threatens to boil over. Damn inflexible geezer! I leave the lobby. MayQueen+Nyan² doesn’t exist on this worldline. Faris isn’t responding to my calls or emails either. Where could she be? Underneath the incandescent heat of the sun, I suddenly get an idea. Daru. If anyone knows where Faris is, it’ll be that stalker of hers.
Itaru: "Yeah? Okarin?"
UNSPOKEN: Hm? It’s awfully noisy on the other end of the phone. But I don’t care about that.
Rintaro: "Daru, do you happen to know where Faris is right now?"
Itaru: "Faris-tan?"
Rintaro: "I need to talk to her right now!"
Itaru: "Right now? That’s not gonna happen."
Rintaro: "Just tell me where she is! You keep tabs on her at all times, don’t you!?"
Itaru: "I know where she is, sure."
Rintaro: "Where!? Where is she!?"
Itaru: "In the UPX assembly hall."
UNSPOKEN: UPX... I look up. I’m standing right in front of UPX.
Rintaro: "Why the assembly hall?"
Itaru: "Today’s the finals of the RaiNet AB GC."
Rintaro: "RaiNet AB GC?"
Itaru: "Short for RaiNet AccessBattlers Grand Championship, duh. It’s the finals, man. Faris is participating. Faris-tan was the winner of this year’s winter GC, so she’s the defending champion. Just so you know."
Rintaro: "She’s... in the finals?"
Itaru: "I’m here too, spectating. The match has already started, man."
UNSPOKEN: So that’s why!
Rintaro: "I’m headed there now. What floor!?"
Itaru: "Do you have a ticket?"
Rintaro: "No, but I’ll manage!"
Itaru: "I don’t know, man. Security’s pretty tight. Someone posted threats on @channel. Pretty sure you’re not getting in."
Rintaro: "Then you come out. I’m in front of UPX. Can you lend me your ticket?"
Itaru: "No way. It’ll end at four, so can’t you just wait until then?"
Rintaro: "H-hey! Daru! Daru! Gh...!"
