UNSPOKEN: When I point out the scientific truth, the man with a bald spot and his lackeys get pissed. This doesn’t look good. I don’t have time to get into a fight. I decide to stage a tactical retreat. Afterwards, I go to the assembly hall and ask the staff about Faris. No luck. When I try calling Daru again, he says Maybe she went home already? in a bummed-out voice. I return to Faris’s apartment building and ring the intercom again. The butler responds once more.
Butler: "May I ask who’s calling?"
Rintaro: "It’s Okabe. Has Fari... has Rumiho-san returned?"
Butler: "...Just a moment."
UNSPOKEN: It sounds like she’s home. The intercom goes silent for a while. And then, the door’s automatic lock opens, allowing me inside the elevator hall.
Butler: "Please come up, sir. The young mistress will see you."
UNSPOKEN: I give him my thanks and hurry into the elevator. The butler guides me into the bedroom, where Faris is sitting on the sofa, hugging her knees. She doesn’t look up, even when I approach.
Rintaro: "Faris! Finally. There’s something I need to ask you."
Faris: "Hmmya..."
UNSPOKEN: She looks exhausted, like all the life has been drained out of her. I’ve never seen Faris like this.
Rintaro: "What happened? You look down."
Faris: "This can’t be happening, nya. Why did Faris have to lose, nyan? If only those guys hadn’t used underhanded tricks on me, nya... They ganged up on Faris... I even promised Papa I’d win... he’s probably disappointed in me, nya... I’m too ashamed to show my face, nya..."
UNSPOKEN: What is she saying? No, wait. I think I get it. I recall what happened after Faris’s final match in the RaiNet championship. That leather-clad asshole called her the former champ. I guess that means she lost. And that’s why she’s depressed. I feel bad for Faris, but I don’t have time to deal with this.
Rintaro: "Listen, Faris!"
UNSPOKEN: Faris blinks her eyes repeatedly when I grab her by the shoulders. But her eyes are glazed and empty of light.
Rintaro: "A couple of days ago, you used the time machine we invented to send a D-Mail. Do you remember that?"
Faris: "Hanya?"
UNSPOKEN: I knew it was useless, but I had to ask. Faris doesn’t remember. In fact, from her perspective, it never happened. How do I explain?
Rintaro: "Let’s say, for example, that there used to be tons of stores for anime otaku here in Akiba. And let’s say you used a time machine, and changed that Akiba into the electric town it is today. How would you do it?"
UNSPOKEN: I know it’s a really cryptic question. But I can’t think of a better way.
Faris: "Time... machine..."
UNSPOKEN: Faris murmurs with a blank expression on her face.
Faris: "Time machine..."
