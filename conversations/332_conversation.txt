Itaru: You gotta cheer for Faris-tan too!
Rintaro: Yeah...
UNSPOKEN: Oblivious to my anxiety, Daru starts jumping and waving his hands in the air.
Spectator A: Faris-tan!
Spectator B: I love you, Faris!
Spectator C: Moe moe!!
UNSPOKEN: Cameras flash as everyone tries to get a picture of the catgirl.
Faris: I'm gonna give it my best, everyone! So cheer for me, nyan♪
UNSPOKEN: The speakers carry her cute, cheerful voice to every corner of the hall. Apparently, they gave microphones to both teams so that they could talk to the audience.
Faris: Ehehehe. Service shot, nyan♪
UNSPOKEN: Faris puts on an impish smile and turns to the audience in a sexy pose. Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooah! The entire hall shakes with the audience's roar. Faris's popularity is overwhelming.
Itaru: There it is! Yes! Faris! It's me! Marry me!
UNSPOKEN: Daru has totally lost it. I wonder if Faris will be alright. Judging from her enthusiasm, it certainly looks like she'll be fine. Once the cheering dies down, I speak to Daru.
Rintaro: How come there are two Viral Attackers, but Faris is all alone?
Itaru: What? You don't even know about that?
UNSPOKEN: I'm not familiar with the rules of RaiNet AccessBattlers. I had Daru explain them before the finals started, but he only covered the basics.
Itaru: In this tournament, duels take place between two-man teams. But since there's nobody strong enough to be Faris-tan's duel partner, she goes alone. Two heads are obviously better than one, but Faris can win despite her handicap! That's why I love her!
Rintaro: These Viral Attackers... what sort of team are they?
Itaru: Hmm. I don't know all the details, but apparently they're a pretty aggressive team. But other than that, there's a bunch of suspicious rumors about them. They've got a lot of followers, you see. And apparently, they don't mind using those followers to interfere with their opponents during duels. About half the teams they faced in the championships were no-shows. And that's not all. Apparently, they even go around beating up otaku in Akiba and Ikebukuro. Long story short, RaiNetters really hate them.
Rintaro: Then why haven't they been disqualified?
Itaru: Cause there's no evidence. RaiNetters are mostly kids and otaku. Just a little intimidation from some guys in black, and they clam up.
