UNSPOKEN: Faris whispers into my ear.
Faris: "Help Faris win, nyan..."
UNSPOKEN: Immediately afterward, I feel something warm and wet on my earlobe. Faris brushes her teeth against my ear, sending electricity through my entire body.
Rintaro: "W-wait! I get it! I get it, okay!?"
UNSPOKEN: I quickly pull away from Faris. That was dangerous. I almost exploded.
Rintaro: "O-okay, Faris. We’ll do it your way."
Faris: "Fur real, nyan!?"
Rintaro: "Yeah. I need you to remember, whatever it takes."
UNSPOKEN: Faris tries to throw her arms around me, but I quickly evade. She face dives into the sofa awkwardly.
Faris: "Hnnya... why’d you dodge, nya?"
Rintaro: "Um... You’re being way too familiar."
UNSPOKEN: I’m not good at dealing with Faris. She’s using me here, I’m sure. ...I’m being tricked, aren’t I? I shake my head. Even so, I have no choice but to help her win the tournament. I’ll try anything that could possibly yield results. As long as I keep doing that, I’ll find a solution eventually. I have to believe that.
Rintaro: "I’m going to leap to this morning and give you some advice that will allow you to win. How’s that?"
Faris: "We’re not sending a mail, nyan?"
Rintaro: "Our lab has developed a device for time leaping, or sending your consciousness to the past."
Faris: "Awesome! So it’s like New Game+, nya?"
Rintaro: "Umm, yeah, that’s it."
UNSPOKEN: Don’t play along. Whatever you do, don’t play along.
Faris: "So if Faris uses it to go back to this morning, it’ll solve everything, nya!"
Rintaro: "You can’t!"
Faris: "Nya!? Why not, nyan?"
Rintaro: "I can’t let anyone else use the Time Leap Machine."
Faris: "No fair, nya."
Rintaro: "It’s not something to be used lightly. It’s dangerous."
UNSPOKEN: It has yet to fail once so far, but my luck might not last forever. Suzuha lost her memory after traveling in a broken time machine. Her time machine was different, of course, but something similar could happen with the Time Leap Machine. Considering the Time Leap Machine’s low budget and rushed schedule, it wouldn’t be surprising if it broke somehow. And there’s one more thing. I shouldn’t allow anyone else to change the past. My goal is to return to the worldline with the IBN 5100, then use it to escape from the Alpha Attractor Field. The fewer changes made, the better.
Rintaro: "I’ll be the one responsible for changing the past. Trust me, Faris."
Faris: "...Okay, nya."
Rintaro: "Guh..."
