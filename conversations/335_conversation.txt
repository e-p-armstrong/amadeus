UNSPOKEN: I wonder if she’s right... No, now’s not the time to doubt. Faris said she would arrive at the assembly hall around 12. I head to UPX, making sure to buy sunglasses and earplugs on the way. There’s still half an hour before the tournament begins, but there’s already a line outside of UPX. I didn’t think there would be many participants since it’s already the finals, but it turns out there’s another tournament for the general public at the same time. The opening act, so to speak. The participants enter the hall through a different entrance than the spectators. I’m at the participant entrance, waiting for Faris to make her appearance. After about 15 minutes, Faris appears. She lives right next door to UPX, so she’s got a lot of leeway time-wise. She’s got her cat ears and her maid uniform on. It feels strange to see her wearing that uniform despite MayQueen not existing on this worldline. Faris’s eyes open wide when she sees me.
Faris: "Kyouma, what are you doing here, nya?"
Rintaro: "I waited here because I wanted to see you."
Faris: "Hanya!? A-are you confessing your love for me? I don’t know what to do if you confess right before such an important match, nyan!"
Rintaro: "D-don’t be ridiculous! Why would I confess to you?"
Faris: "...You’re awfully serious today, nya. Usually you play along more, nya."
UNSPOKEN: I don’t have time to be Hououin Kyouma now.
Faris: "I’m nervous about the finals, so I want to lift my spirits, nyan."
UNSPOKEN: She doesn’t look nervous.
Rintaro: "Please just listen to me, Faris! This is important for your victory."
Faris: "Important? But you don’t even know the rules of RaiNet, nya?"
Rintaro: "It’s not about the rules or anything like that."
Faris: "Then what is it, nya?"
UNSPOKEN: She peers at me with questioning eyes. I’d better give her the goods before I screw this up.
Rintaro: "Take these with you."
UNSPOKEN: I try handing over the sunglasses and earplugs I bought on the way here. But Faris pulls back, as if on guard.
Faris: "Kyouma... that’s lame, nya..."
UNSPOKEN: How rude!
Faris: "You’re supposed to bring nicer presents, like--"
Rintaro: "It’s not a present. These are countermeasures!"
Faris: "Nya?"
Rintaro: "Listen good. I came from the future."
Faris: "I know, nya."
Rintaro: "What!?"
UNSPOKEN: She knows? How!? Why!?
Faris: "And Faris came from space, nya."
UNSPOKEN: Don’t forget, this is Faris NyanNyan we’re dealing with.
Rintaro: "I’m not joking around here! I seriously leapt here from six this evening! I know the outcome of today’s RaiNet GC final."
Faris: "Don’t tell me. Overwhelming victory for Faris--"
Rintaro: "No. You lose."
Faris: "Nyau..."
UNSPOKEN: Faris frowns.
Rintaro: "But that’s only because of the opposing team’s interference. So to protect you, I brought you these sunglasses and earplugs."
