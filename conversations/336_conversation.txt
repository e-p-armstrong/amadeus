Rintaro: "Are you listening!?"
UNSPOKEN: I grab Faris’s slender shoulders. She’s shaking.
Rintaro: "Faris?"
Faris: "Unyaaaaa! Kyouma, you meanie!"
UNSPOKEN: And then she suddenly explodes!
Faris: "This is a very important match for Faris, nya! How dare you say I’ll lose nya! You’re being mean! Are you a Viral Attackers spy, nya!?"
Rintaro: "N-no, look, it wasn’t your fault you lost. It’s--"
Faris: "Hmya! Not listenyan!"
Rintaro: "Hgg...!"
UNSPOKEN: After a swift kick to my shin, Faris turns her back to me in a huff. Damn you, catgirl! For once in your life, listen to me!
Rintaro: "W-wait! I said wait! I need you to win, no matter what!"
Faris: "Like I said, there’s no way I can lose, nya! And I don’t wannya wear those ugly glasses, nya! Faris needs to be cute at every moment! My fans are counting on me, nya!"
UNSPOKEN: Crap, she’s getting angry at me now. Faris shakes me off and runs to the participant entrance. I’m not a participant, so if she makes it inside, that’s the end of it.
Rintaro: "Please hear me out!"
UNSPOKEN: Bearing the pain in my shin, I force my way in front of Faris and stand in her way.
Rintaro: "Faris, please. Mayuri’s life depends on it!"
Faris: "Someone! Someone come here, nya! Help me, nyan!"
UNSPOKEN: Faris suddenly starts shouting. She grabs the attention of the surrounding participants and spectators. Even staff members are gathering. Crap, I can’t talk about time machines or Mayuri’s life with this much attention around us. But unless I can get Faris to listen to me, there’s no way I can undo her D-Mail. What should I do?
4℃: "You seem to have an awful lot of time on your hands. Eh, Champion?"
UNSPOKEN: That smug voice. A tall man dressed entirely in black walks up to us with a grin on his face. Whenever he takes a step, all of his silver accessories jingle. He dramatically takes off his sunglasses, revealing the face of that guy who gave me trouble before. If I’m not mistaken, he called himself 4℃ or something like that.
4℃: "Heh. Swooping down unto the street, I am the black peacock of the RaiNetter realm. The name’s 4℃. That’s Shido, you get me? I’m the leader of the Viral Attackers."
Faris: "The Viral Attackers..."
