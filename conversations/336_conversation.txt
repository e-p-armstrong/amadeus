UNSPOKEN: 4℃ slowly flips over the card he took from Faris. The entire audience waits for the card to be revealed... And then, displayed on the monitor--
Announcer: What!? Just when we all thought the card was a Link Card!
4℃: A V-v-virus Card!!?
Announcer: A HUGE! TURN! A! ROUUUUUUUUUUUUND!!
UNSPOKEN: She did it! She... really turned defeat into victory! It's like she knew exactly what was going to happen. She was in control of the battle all along. The audience goes wild. Their cheers shake the hall.
Announcer: We have our winner! Fariiiis NyaaanNyan! Two time undefeated champion! Congratulatioooons!
UNSPOKEN: As the hall rocks with the jubilation of the crown, Daru and I clasp hands and share in the excitement of Faris's victory. With the tournament over, I wait for Faris outside the hall. I sent Daru home already. I'll have to tell Faris about Mayuri soon, and I don't want him to hear it.
Faris: Kyouma!
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Faris runs up to me, paying no heed to the curious stares of the crowd. She's still in her maid clothes, and she's carrying two bouquets of flowers, which she received from her adoring fans.
Rintaro: Congratulations on your victory, Fa--
UNSPOKEN: Faris jumps at me before I can finish. She jumps into my arms, embracing me, and there's a warm feeling against my cheek. A k-kiss? Was that a kiss?
Faris: Thanks for everything, nyan!
UNSPOKEN: Faris smiles innocently. It's like her entire body is glowing with pure joy.
Rintaro: N-no... I can't have you thanking me like this. I need something else from you.
Faris: What's that, nya? You mean a kiss isn't enough, so you want to go on a date, nyan? Aww, Kyouma, you're so greedy, nyan. But you know, Faris doesn't mind, nya♪
UNSPOKEN: Faris puts on an impish smile.
Rintaro: I'm glad those earplugs I gave you did the trick. So get off, it's too hot.
UNSPOKEN: I forcefully pry Faris's body off me. Everyone is staring at us.
Faris: I'm sorry for doubting you, nya. It wouldn't have been such a close game if I just believed you to begin with, nya.
UNSPOKEN: Faris bashfully paws at her head. I take that paw of hers and leave the scene. We get to the overpass, and finally lose sight of all the tournament spectators.
Rintaro: Faris. Now you'll listen to what I have to say, right?
Faris: Nya?
Rintaro: I brought you sunglasses and earplugs. But I didn't come up with the idea.
Faris: Really, nya? Then who--
Rintaro: You did.
UNSPOKEN: Faris looks at me in confusion.
Rintaro: To be precise, the you two hours from now. The first time, you lost to the Viral Attackers' underhanded tactics. And then you asked me to use my time machine to stop them.
