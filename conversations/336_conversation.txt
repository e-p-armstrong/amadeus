Rintaro: This was a contract, so to speak. You almost remembered the D-Mail you sent to change the past, even though you should've forgotten. You said that you'd remember if you won the RaiNet tournament.
Faris: ???
Rintaro: Well? Do you remember? It's very important, so I need you to try.
Faris: Hm...
UNSPOKEN: Faris stares into my eyes, as if she's looking for something. Then she puts a finger against her lips in thought. Finally, she smiles.
Faris: Faris was probably pulling your tail, nya.
Rintaro: What?
Faris: That Faris was depressed she lost to the Virals, nya? So when she heard about the time machine, she wanted to use it to win, nya. Because if she didn't, she'd be too ashamed to see Papa, nya... I'm sure she just played along with Kyouma, and said she remembered... that's what I think, nya... That's probably what Faris would do, nya.
Rintaro: No way...
UNSPOKEN: Damn! I was a fool to trust this catgirl! I should've expected this from how she normally acts! I breathe a deep sigh and lean on the overpass's guardrail. So in the end, all that work was for nothing. I still need to fix the warped timeline, but I don't know the contents of Faris's D-Mail. Faris forgot it ever happened, and it isn't in her send history. What should I do?
Faris: Kyouma.
UNSPOKEN: And suddenly, Faris whispers into my ear.
Faris: Look into Faris's eyes, nya.
Rintaro: What?
Faris: Just look, nya.
UNSPOKEN: Faris's face is right beside mine. Her breath tickles my ear. We're awfully close. Does she plan to kiss me on the lips this time? But her expression is uncharacteristically serious, so I gulp and do as I'm told. I turn to Faris and stare down into her eyes. Faris looks up at me too. If an outsider were to see us, they'd think we were a couple lost in our own world. This is the closest I've ever been to Faris. I'm captivated by the beauty of her features. Wow... her eyelashes are really long.
Faris: Nervous, nya?
Rintaro: O-of course not. I'm busy solving Fermat's Last Theorem in my head.
Faris: In other words, you're nervous, nya. The truth is, Faris has only one power, nya.
Rintaro: Your power? Do you mean...
Faris: It's a secret, but I'll make an exception for Kyouma. Truth is, Faris can read people's minds, nyan. I call my power Cheshire Break. Whatcha think, nya? Awesome, nyan?
Rintaro: ...I'm an exception? But the Virals knew about it too, didn't they?
Faris: I had no idea the cat was out of the bag, nya.
UNSPOKEN: I won't deny the existence of supernatural powers. After all, I have one of my own, called Reading Steiner.
Faris: Ever since I was small, I could tell what Papa's business partners were thinking from the looks on their faces, nya. It's more like intuition or a sixth sense, nya. Based on eye movements, facial expressions, and gestures, I can tell when someone's lying, nya.
