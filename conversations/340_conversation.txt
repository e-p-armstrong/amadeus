UNSPOKEN: I take out my phone and open the compose mail screen. I send Daru an SOS. Faris and I are hiding above 'Ramen Tasaburou.' It's mostly empty with some sacks of wheat flour. Nothing that looks useful as a weapon, and nothing big enough to hide behind. The Viral Attackers are chasing us, and I don't think they can be reasoned with. Normally I'd have no trouble taking on all of them, but I can't use my full strength with Faris nearby. Call us a taxi, pronto. I send the email.
Rintaro: --whew
UNSPOKEN: It's hot as hell in here. The running has made me thirsty.
Rintaro: Haah, haah... If this were MayQueen, we'd have air conditioning, and I could get something to drink...
Faris: Nya?
Rintaro: Oh, nothing...
UNSPOKEN: I just said the first thing that came to mind, but Faris looks at me strangely.
Faris: How do you know the name of the maid cafe that was supposed to open here, nya?
Rintaro: Eh...?
Faris: Oh, I know. We opened up the homepage for a little bit to post maid recruiting information, nyan. Did you see it?
Rintaro: ...It was supposed to open?
Faris: Faris organyaized the cafe's plans and passed it through the conference. It was almost a done deal, nyan. But at the last moment, Papa put his paw down, and the plan died, nya. Papa's such a blockhead, nya... If he left the store to me, it would've been the best maid cafe in all of Japan, with mmhmm costumes and hnngtastic maids, nya. It would've even pulled customers to Akiba from all the way over in Ueno and Ikebukuro. It's such a waste, nya.
UNSPOKEN: The Akihabara I know catered to fans of games, anime, and moe culture. The current Akihabara is still the electric town of old. This used to be the maid cafe, MayQueen+NyanÂ². But now it's a ramen shop. And if I remember correctly, Faris wasn't this attached to RaiNet AccessBattlers on the previous worldline.
Rintaro: Faris... no, Akiha Rumiho.
Faris: Hanyan?
Rintaro: You're the Akiha daughter and heir, so you go to the Akihabara city development conferences too, right?
Faris: Nnya? I don't attend, nya.
Rintaro: You don't? But didn't you say that...
UNSPOKEN: Did she say that before the worldline changed?
Faris: Papa's the one who goes to the conferences, nya. Why would Faris have to go nya?
Rintaro: Then, why did you go to the conferences?
Faris: Like I said, I don't, nya.
