Itaru: "You can discuss with your partner what moves to make. It’s harder for the opponent to predict what you’re going to do."
UNSPOKEN: So basically, the partner just plays a support role.
Itaru: "Well, there’s nothing to worry about. Faris-tan can beat the daylights outta these punks in the blink of an eye."
Announcer: "Are both teams ready?"
UNSPOKEN: The referee gathers Faris and the two Virals for a coin toss to decide who takes the first turn.
Announcer: "And now, for the RaiNet AccessBattlers Grand Championship Finals--"
UNSPOKEN: Instantly, silence falls on the assembly hall. Everyone holds their breath in anticipation.
Announcer: "Duel Access!"
UNSPOKEN: The referee’s shout signals the start of the game. The room erupts in cheers. First up is Faris. The huge monitor hanging from the ceiling displays the Circuit Mat -- the thing that looks like a chessboard. The cards glitter and sparkle in the stage lights. All cards on the board are face down, but each player is allowed to peek at his or her own cards. The cameras are oriented in a way that the audience can’t see what cards they have. According to Daru, RaiNet AccessBattlers is a game of psychological warfare. It’s all about figuring out where your opponent has placed his cards. Each player starts with four Link Cards and four Virus Cards, for a total of eight cards face down on the board. The victory conditions are a little complex, but in short, you win if you take four of your opponent’s Link Cards or if you make your opponent take four of your Virus Cards. The game starts with each player trying to figure out how the other has placed his or her cards. Knowing your opponent’s layout lets you shift the game to your advantage. That’s why it’s important to be careful what moves you make, whether you’re attacking or defending. Your Duel Partner’s there to make it harder for your opponent to read your thoughts. I watch as the duel between Faris and the Viral Attackers unfolds before my eyes. Every time a Link Card or Virus Card is revealed, waves of excitement ripple through the audience. I’m starting to understand just how amazing Faris must be to become champion all by herself. The audience is on the edge of their seats. As best as I can tell, it looks like the Viral Attackers are, true to their name, on the attack.
Rintaro: "What sort of strategy does Faris use?"
Itaru: "I guess you could say she’s a slow starter. She spends the first half focusing on reading her opponent’s cards. She plays it safe. And instead, she waits until the endgame for a sudden reversal. That’s probably how she’ll play it this time, too."
