UNSPOKEN: We won’t know if the card she took was a Link Card or a Virus Card until she opens it. The card Faris snatched is...
Itaru: "No way!"
Rintaro: "What happened!?"
Itaru: "I can’t believe it. She took a Virus Card... She almost never goes on the offensive. Maybe the Virals are enough of a threat to warrant a change of strategy."
4℃: "Pff, looks like our pussy champ here is frightened by the heavy rock wings of the black peacock. Your fear is showing. I can see your cowardly pussy-shivering with these fallen angel eyes of mine. This little ’strategy change’ of yours? It’s an obvious fake. My elegant evil heart whispers so. I’ve done my research. You never go on the offensive. You’re the cautious, thinking-type. I know all about your little mind tricks. You can’t fool me. That card you attacked with just now is a Virus Card, no doubt. You think I’ll take the bait, don’t you? This black nobleman set off a red alarm in your heart, awakening your wild survival instincts. And that’s why you suddenly changed your strategy. But it’s too late for that now. Such inelegant tricks as that have not a chance to stain our blackness. For we are the Viral Attackers, the Black Justice. The usurpers of RaiNet. The rebellion against this fickle Sanctuary."
Rintaro: "He sure can talk..."
UNSPOKEN: And I still have no idea what he’s saying.
Itaru: "I hate those guys."
UNSPOKEN: Faris was radiant when she greeted the audience, but now her cheer and luster have evaporated in the face of 4℃’s taunts.
Itaru: "Well, you gotta admit. Pressuring your opponent is an important part of RaiNet. If you shake your opponent up, their reaction might help you figure out their card layout."
Rintaro: "...This game sounds pretty hardcore."
Itaru: "To tell you the truth, RaiNet’s more popular with adults than with kids. Even the anime’s like that. It’s marketed towards kids, but the story’s going down a pretty hard route. That, and Kirari-chan’s sexy!"
UNSPOKEN: Like I care, perv. Only three minutes have passed since the start of the duel, and Faris is already frowning. She’s also fidgeting in her seat, as if there’s something bothering her.
Rintaro: "A laser!"
Itaru: "Eh? What?"
Rintaro: "Look! Near her eyes! There’s a red dot!"
UNSPOKEN: It appears in short intervals, so it’s difficult to spot, but there’s definitely a laser shining in Faris’s eyes.
Itaru: "...Seriously?"
UNSPOKEN: Daru stares at her eyes for a few seconds, then shakes his head.
Itaru: "I can’t tell. But if you’re right, Okarin, then someone in the audience is trying to sabotage her! Damn those Virals!"
Rintaro: "Why doesn’t the referee stop them!?"
Itaru: "They must be timing it so that the referee doesn’t see."
