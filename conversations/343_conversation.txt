UNSPOKEN: Faris still doesn’t respond. She hasn’t said a word since the match started. But I got rid of the interference, so Faris should come up with a reversal any second now. I stare at her, praying for a miracle. And when I do, Faris once again turns her face away, as if trying to avoid something.
Rintaro: "What!?"
UNSPOKEN: Is it another laser!?
4℃: "Hey, Champion. They say your eyes can see into a man’s soul. They say you have the power to read minds, which makes you a cheater even my pure black evil heart can’t abide."
UNSPOKEN: What? She does?
4℃: "Basically, ya ain’t human. You’re an ugly angel. ’Cause you peek into the heart of any poor sap who talks to you. Everyone, beware! Keep your distance! Or this pussy will steal your every secret by reading your thoughts! And then she’ll blackmail you. Hand over your money? Throw your RaiNet match? What will you demand next!?"
UNSPOKEN: The audience begins to murmur. If Faris does have that kind of power, then it’s no wonder she’s so good at RaiNet. My chuunibyou imagination starts to run wild, but I try my best to keep it suppressed. If Faris really can see through lies, it would explain why she hated the laser beam attacks so much. It would also explain why her moves made so little sense this match.
Rintaro: "Faris!"
Faris: "...ctory"
4℃: "Ah? What was that?"
Faris: "...I use Change Directory. Nya."
