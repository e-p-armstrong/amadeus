Rintaro: No... my right hand... my right haaaaand! Please, stop! I don't want to kill any moooore!
4℃: Hey, what the hell is he doing?
UNSPOKEN: Something strikes the top of my head. One of the Virals threw a can at me.
Viral Attacker C: Don't let him trick you! He's just a textbook chuunibyou case!
Rintaro: Yeah, like you guys can talk.
Viral Attacker D: Whatever! Just kick his ass!
Rintaro: Very well... then prepare yourselves! Releasing restriction si--
UNSPOKEN: Before I can finish, 4℃ kicks me in the solar plexus.
Rintaro: Gweh...
Faris: Kyouma!
UNSPOKEN: He grabs the top of my head and knees me repeatedly. Finally, he lets go of my hair. I start coughing as soon as I hit the ground. Next, 4℃ lays into me with heavy kicks to the head and body. I raise my arms to protect my face.
4℃: Heh! I told you, man! The coldest ice burns!
Rintaro: That's frostbite, you idiot--
4℃: Why you!
UNSPOKEN: He starts stomping on me with his booted heels.
Faris: Kyouma!
UNSPOKEN: All I can feel is pain. I abandon all thought and wait for the storm to pass.
Faris: Stop it, nya! Don't hurt Kyouma any more!
4℃: Don't tell me what to do! I only listen to the whispers of Gaia!
UNSPOKEN: 4℃ grabs my thumb in both hands. Then, he starts to twist.
Faris: Stop it! Someone, help!
UNSPOKEN: I hear a sound. A car's exhaust. The honking of a horn. A limousine barrels into the alleyway at terrific speed. Everyone screams and scatters to avoid it. The smell of burnt rubber. Tire tracks on the asphalt. The limousine stops right in front my fallen body. The back door opens.
Faris’s Dad: Get inside!
Faris: P-Papa!
UNSPOKEN: But I can't even stand up. There's no strength in my body left. My vision's blurry, too. Slender arms wrap around my body, pulling me towards the car. The soft scent of citrus tickles my nose.
Faris: Hang in there, nya!
UNSPOKEN: I let her help me into the limousine.
4℃: W-wait! You're not getting away!
UNSPOKEN: The door shuts, cutting off his shouting. The car speeds off like a bullet. There's a softness under my head. We're inside the limousine. My head is resting on Faris's lap. Every inch of my body feels like it's on fire. And at the same time, there's a terrible cold in my bones. I can barely hear. My ears are ringing. The urge to vomit has receded, at least. They really messed me up. According to Faris's dad, he was racing to UPX to congratulate Faris when he saw us. A fortunate coincidence, indeed. Is this also the choice of Steins Gate?
Faris’s Dad: I really need to thank you, Okabe-kun. Thank you for protecting my daughter.
Rintaro: P-protecting...?
