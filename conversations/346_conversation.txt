Rintaro: "...Wait, so you’ve been using that power at RaiNet tournaments?"
Faris: "Of course, nya♪ Faris is an entertainer, nyan. It’s my style to get into a tight spot on purpose so I can make a huge turnaround, nyan. Besides, if I wear sunglasses, I can’t read my opponent’s thoughts, nyan."
UNSPOKEN: Is that why she didn’t put them on?
Faris: "It’s because of this power that I knew you weren’t lying."
Rintaro: "But you wouldn’t go along with me at all in the beginning, though."
Faris: "You just rubbed my fur the wrong way, nya."
UNSPOKEN: It feels like she’s tricking me again.
Faris: "And I can tell you’re not lying now either, nya. Faris used that ’D-Mail’ thing to change the past, nya? I believe you, nya. I wish I could remember... but I’m sorry, nya. I can’t remember, nyan..."
Rintaro: "I see..."
UNSPOKEN: We’ve reached an impasse. I have no choice but to look for some other way.
Rintaro: "...?"
UNSPOKEN: I suddenly feel intense stares on us. I realize that we’re surrounded by people. Are they jealous Faris fans who think I’m her boyfriend!? I shudder at the thought, but I don’t think that’s the case. Then who are they? Moeka’s Rounders!?
4℃: "Yo."
UNSPOKEN: A man clad in black steps forward. Oh, it’s the bald spot guy again. What does he want now? I realize that the men surrounding us are all dressed like 4℃. So are all of these guys Viral Attacker underlings? 4℃’s gaudy white teeth shine.
4℃: "I’ve got a word with you, champion. Gaia whispered for me to register an objection."
Faris: "An objection?"
4℃: "You damn pussy. The power to read the minds of your opponents? That’s bullshit! I know you were cheating!"
Rintaro: "She wasn’t cheating! You’re the ones who were cheating!"
Faris: "Faris doesn’t use underhanded tricks like you guys, nya."
4℃: "The hell you say? I, the black nobleman, swear to the god of the elegant evil realm, that I never cheat! Though sometimes I do other things. Okay, you corrupt white Siamese cat? I ain’t gonna accept that defeat. That last Change Directory was a fraud."
Rintaro: "You don’t have any proof."
