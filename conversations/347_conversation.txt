UNSPOKEN: Jeers fly from the surrounding Virals. None of the onlookers approach. I guess they don’t want to get involved. What a farce. How long do we have to listen to this?
Rintaro: "Let’s go, Faris."
Faris: "Nya...?"
UNSPOKEN: I grab Faris’s wrist and force our way through the surrounding Virals. As we run from the place, I look back and see--
4℃: "Hold it right there!"
UNSPOKEN: 4℃ and his group are chasing after us. All we can do is run. A phone call? Now!?
Rintaro: "Hello!?"
Itaru: "It’s me."
Rintaro: "What!? I’m! Busy! Now!"
Itaru: "You still at the hall?"
Rintaro: "No!"
Itaru: "You haven’t seen Faris-tan, have you? Actually, everything’s on fire--"
Rintaro: "On fire!? What is!?"
Itaru: "Her blogs and fan sites!"
UNSPOKEN: Damn! The Viral Attackers must be flooding the net with false accusations. Those scumbags!
Rintaro: "I’m hanging up!"
UNSPOKEN: I press the End Call button and run even faster. There’s no way I can pick up now! I ignore the call and run even faster.
Faris: "Kyouma! Those guys! Are still tailing us, nyan!"
Rintaro: "Tch...!"
UNSPOKEN: Keep running. Just keep running! While gasping for oxygen, I pull Faris by the hand and run faster. We zigzag through the streets of Akiba until we loop back to UPX. Faris’s home is right next door. We should have gone there first.
Rintaro: "Haah, haah, whew!"
Faris: "Haahaah, whew, whewww..."
UNSPOKEN: My lungs are on fire. My legs are aching.
Faris: "Kyouma! Look, nya!"
Rintaro: "What?"
UNSPOKEN: Faris tugs at my sleeve, stopping me. I look at where she’s pointing, and there I see... Several unsavory-looking young men clad in black leather loitering near the apartment building’s entrance. Damn! They got here first!
Faris: "We can’t get in like this, nya..."
Rintaro: "Let’s get out of here!"
UNSPOKEN: We try to cut through Yodobashi and head to Showa-dori, but get caught en route.
Viral Attacker A: "There they are!"
Viral Attacker B: "Text the location!"
Rintaro: "...!"
UNSPOKEN: Damn! How many of them are there!? All we can do is turn back. We won’t make any progress if we keep running like this. We need to find somewhere we can rest. The lab. We can manage something if we escape there. We need to get there somehow. But there are Virals loitering around the lab. There’s no way we can get past them.
Rintaro: "Wheww, whew, haahaahaah..."
UNSPOKEN: We end up seeking refuge in the ramen shop behind the lab. The ramen shop behind the lab. On another worldline, this was MayQueen+Nyan², where Faris and Mayuri worked as maids.
Faris: "Why are we stopping here, nya? We need to run!"
