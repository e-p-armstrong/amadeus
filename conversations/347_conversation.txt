Rintaro: Those guys were obsessed with black.
UNSPOKEN: She slaps me on the knee lightly.
Faris: Come on. I'm trying to be serious.
UNSPOKEN: Wh-what? Even her retort is normal. The person sitting in front of me isn't a cat-eared maid, and she isn't the RaiNet Champion. She's just a normal girl...
Faris: Does it still hurt?
Rintaro: No, I'm fine.
Faris: Kyouma... I mean, Okabe-san. I don't know what would've happened if you hadn't been there. I shiver just thinking about it.
Rintaro: Don't correct yourself like that. Just call me what you usually do.
UNSPOKEN: Faris sighs.
Faris: Anyway, Kyouma, I can't thank you enough. Thank you, honestly... You know, Kyouma... You're my prince.
UNSPOKEN: Prince? What's with the fairy tale talk? She's giving me goosebumps. T-this calls for Hououin Kyouma!
Rintaro: I am not a prince! I am an insane mad scientist and--
UNSPOKEN: Before I finish, Faris throws herself on top of me.
Rintaro: ...!?
UNSPOKEN: She wraps her arms around me tightly.
Rintaro: F-Faris...?
Faris: I want you to call me Rumiho.
Rintaro: No, Faris is Faris, remember?
UNSPOKEN: T-this is bad. What should I do!? What does Faris want!?
Faris: Hey... I think it's time to end this. You went back in time, and risked your life to save me. So, I want to grant your wish too.
Rintaro: But...
UNSPOKEN: I swallow the rest of my words. Granting my wish would mean erasing her father's existence. My heart aches. It was like this with Suzuha, too. I erased everything that Suzuha had shared with us in 2010, including her memories of meeting her father. I did it for the sake of my personal goal, to save Mayuri. Must I once again sacrifice someone else's dream?
Faris: It was on my eighth birthday.
UNSPOKEN: Still clinging to me, Faris looks down and begins her story.
Faris: I wanted Papa to take a break from work so he could spend time with me. Papa's company wasn't as big back then, so he worked every day, from morning to night. I never got to see him. The present I wanted most was for him to spend one whole day with me. And Papa promised. He promised he'd spend the entire day with me, no matter what. But... Something came up, and he had to break his promise the day before. I was so afraid that Papa didn't really love me. So on my birthday, I ran away from home. I wanted to make Papa worry.
UNSPOKEN: Faris pauses here for a time. Then she looks up at me and continues with tears in her eyes.
Faris: ...The plane Papa was on made a bad landing. Only one person died in the accident. Everyone else was unharmed.
UNSPOKEN: Don't tell me...
Faris: The one casualty... was Papa...
UNSPOKEN: That was before the worldline changed.
Faris: I couldn't believe the world would be so cruel to me. 'I hate you, Papa! You should just die!' Those were the last words I ever said to him. ...And that's how our relationship ended, forever.
