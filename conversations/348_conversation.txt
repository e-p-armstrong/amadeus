Faris: I loved him... so why? Why did I say those things to him? I always felt guilty because of what I said. I always wished I could go back in time... change what happened.
UNSPOKEN: Then... did fate guide us to each other?
Faris: When I heard you talking about your time machine, I thought I was being given a chance.
Rintaro: Faris... Rumiho. That's enough for today. You don't have to say anything more.
Faris: No. Let me finish.
UNSPOKEN: Faris doesn't let go of me. She sniffles and wipes away her tears, putting on a smile.
Faris: I'm okay now. Papa came to save me... so I know how much he really loves me. I really enjoyed having this time to spend with him. It was like a gift to us from heaven. But now you need to change things back to the way they were.
Rintaro: But...
Faris: Mayushii's a very important friend to me. If Mayushii's in danger, I'll do anything to save her.
Rintaro: ...I'm sorry.
Faris: Weren't you listening? This current reality isn't reality at all, but rather, a gift to my father and me. Or maybe I should call it a dream. Papa doesn't belong in this time. You're just turning things back to normal. Thank you for letting me have this dream, Kyouma.
Rintaro: Are you... really okay with that?
UNSPOKEN: Faris buries her face into my chest.
Faris: A-actually... I'm not okay at all... I remember how things were before the world changed... But I also remember how everything was after the world changed, you know? I'm actually kind of freaking out right now. What happened before the change and after the change are all mixed up inside me. I don't know which one is real anymore. But if I try to fight it, it'll just make you sad, won't it? I don't want to make you sad. You are my prince, after all.
Rintaro: We can do something! There might be a world where you don't lose your dad and Mayuri doesn't die! If we try--
Faris: It's okay. I've accepted it. I don't want to run away anymore.
UNSPOKEN: There's nothing I can say to that. So instead, I tightly embrace her slender body.
Rintaro: ...Thank you.
Faris: Hey, is it okay if I cry a little? Before we change things back, is it okay... if I cry for Papa?
