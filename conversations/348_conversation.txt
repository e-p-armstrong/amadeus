Rintaro: Faris...
UNSPOKEN: I can see the traces of tears on her face. The sight makes my heart ache.
Faris: I'll go say my last goodbyes to Papa now, nyan.
UNSPOKEN: Oh? Her usual speaking habits returned the second she donned her cat ears. What a nifty piece of equipment.
Faris: Let me be alone with Papa for a while, nya.
UNSPOKEN: Maybe I should say Wait. Maybe I should say Sorry. But I say nothing to Faris's back as she heads to her father's study. By the time Faris finishes her farewells with her father and comes out of the study, the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s settings are already complete. I contact Daru at the lab and make sure the Braun Tube Workshop's 42-inch CRT is turned on. Now all we have to do is send the D-Mail. But I hesitate. Instead of meeting Faris's eyes, I look down at my feet. Eternal separation from her father... I wonder what Faris is thinking now.
Faris: Don't be like that, Kyouma. You've done nothing wrong, nyan.
Rintaro: But...
Faris: NyanNyan♪ No more talking, nyan!
Rintaro: ...Okay.
UNSPOKEN: I can't stay sad when Faris is trying to cheer me up. I steel myself for what I need to do. Yesterday, just before she left the room, Faris told me the contents of the first D-Mail she sent. 100 mil for your kid. Take the train That mail stopped her father from getting on the airplane. As a result, he didn't die. But that wasn't the only effect it had on the timeline. Her father needed to sell the IBN 5100 to prepare the hundred million yen ransom. As a result, Faris never donated the IBN 5100 to Yanabayashi Shrine. With her father alive, Faris didn't participate in Akihabara's city development conferences. Otaku-oriented businesses never took root in Akiba. MayQueen+Nyan² never opened. Faris wasn't as busy, which allowed her to join the RaiNet tournament circuit. In other words, this worldline's Faris has a normal life. On the worldline I came from, Faris was not only a student, but also the heir to her father's company, an influential member of the Akihabara development board, and a part-time maid waitress. Which life is better for her? Which will give her greater happiness? That's not my decision. It's hers. And her decision is to return to the way things were. I'm just here to help her wake up from this dream. Faris has already entered the cancellation D-Mail. JK on ransom I luv u papa See you soon These are Faris's true last words to her father.
Faris: Um... when we change things back, will my memories of this world disappear, nya?
Rintaro: ...Of course not. You'll remember. You have memories from both worlds right now, don't you?
Faris: Is that why you were so desperate to help Faris, nya?
