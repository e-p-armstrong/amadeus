Faris: "Yeah! By the way, we still haven’t found an IBN 5100, nyan."
Rintaro: "Has your dad ever sold any or given one away?"
UNSPOKEN: On another worldline, Faris’s dad donated the IBN 5100 to Yanabayashi Shrine. Or was it Faris who did that?
Faris: "Never, nya. Papa loves all of the PCs he’s collected, nya. He’d never get rid of one, nya."
UNSPOKEN: The why did he donate the IBN 5100?
Rintaro: "Do you have any retro PCs, Faris?"
Faris: "I don’t get Papa’s hobby at all, nya. Faris likes cosplay and anime and cute things, nyan."
UNSPOKEN: The reason the moe shops disappeared was because Faris didn’t participate in the city development conferences. I guess that’s what the D-Mail was about.
Rintaro: "Let’s say you participated in city development ever since you were a child."
Faris: "I’d put moe shops all over Akiba, nya. Just visit ComiMa and you’ll see the wonder of otaku power, nya. I’m sure more people would visit Akiba then, nyan."
Rintaro: "That aside, if you no longer wanted to participate after participating for all that time... How would you stop yourself in the past?"
Faris: "Is this some sorta psychological test, nya?"
Rintaro: "It’s just a hypothetical question."
UNSPOKEN: Faris ponders this for a while.
Faris: "Hm... a dramatic way would be purrfect."
Rintaro: "What?"
Faris: "Like you see on TV, nya. Faris is weak to drama, nya. I probably got that from Papa, nyan."
UNSPOKEN: Really?
Faris: "For example, if Faris got kidnapped or--"
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Faris falls silent. It’s a dark room. I can’t read her expression.
Faris: "Kid...napped?"
Rintaro: "Faris?"
UNSPOKEN: What’s wrong? Faris suddenly clutches her head.
Faris: "Ugh... My head hurts, nya... H-hey, Kyouma... Faris has been feeling funny since coming to this storehouse, nya... Even though I only came here once, back when I was a little kitten... It feels really... nyastalgic... Like I’ve been here... many times, nya..."
UNSPOKEN: What does this mean? Is she messing with me again? No, this feels too real.
Faris: "Ah..."
UNSPOKEN: Her face lights up. And then she grabs my arm.
Faris: "I... remember..."
Rintaro: "Remember what?"
Faris: "I remember, nya!"
UNSPOKEN: The force of her declaration stifles my response.
Faris: "MayQueen+Nyan²! Kyouma and Daru-nyan were regular customers, nya. And Mayushii worked here too, nya."
Rintaro: "Really? You really remember that?"
UNSPOKEN: Faris nods.
Faris: "And how Kyouma and Daru talked about the time machine at the store, and how I asked to use it in return for helping find an IBN 5100. And how later, I convinced Kyouma and Daru-nyan it was weird to compare time to a river. And how I took the blood oath to become a lab mem."
