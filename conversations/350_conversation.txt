Rintaro: "And the D-Mail? Do you remember what you sent?"
UNSPOKEN: Faris lets out a sigh. Her smile suddenly disappears. Don’t tell me that’s all she remembers? Or was she tricking me again?
Faris: "I remember, but... you said you have to cancel it, nya?"
Rintaro: "Yes. I need to undo the changes made to the past by your D-Mail."
Faris: "You can’t, nya!"
UNSPOKEN: Faris shakes her head violently and presses her body against me again. We’re alone in this dim storehouse. I can feel her hot breath against my cheek. There’s no one here to see us. We’re safe. I feel myself getting excited by her proximity. No! I need to keep my cool!
Faris: "You can’t undo it, nya..."
Rintaro: "Please listen, Faris! Mayuri’s life depends on it!"
Faris: "Eh... Mayushii’s...?"
Rintaro: "If we don’t return the worldline to normal... if I don’t get that IBN 5100, then Mayuri will die. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it’s the truth. So please. I need to send another D-Mail and cancel the one you--"
Faris: "The wish Faris made with her D-Mail..."
UNSPOKEN: Faris cuts in, as if to silence me. Her eyes are wet, reflecting the dim light.
Faris: "The wish Faris made... ...was to save Papa, who died ten years ago, nya."
Rintaro: "--!?"
UNSPOKEN: What...?
Faris: "I exchanged the past where Papa died, for a past where he didn’t die, nyan."
UNSPOKEN: You mean that kind-looking man, her father... died ten years ago? That’s consistent with everything, now that I think about it. Faris really has remembered her D-Mail. Now that I know the result, all I have to do is send the cancellation D-Mail. But it’s not so simple. I need to cancel the D-Mail that prevented her father’s death ten years ago. Isn’t that the same as killing him again?
Rintaro: "!?"
UNSPOKEN: I hear the door open and quickly cover Faris’s mouth with my hand.
Viral Attacker A: "Is Faris really hiding in here?"
Viral Attacker B: "Someone saw two people who looked like them go inside."
UNSPOKEN: Crap! Someone saw us!? We need to do something. If they call their friends, we’re done for.
Rintaro: "...!"
