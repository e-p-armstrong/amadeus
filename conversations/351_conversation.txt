Kurisu: "Okabe! Can you hear me!? We called a taxi, but it’ll take some time to get there."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu...
Rintaro: "You exposed us to the pursuers. They’re right in front of us!"
Viral Attacker A: "Hey, come out!"
Viral Attacker B: "There’s no point in hiding!"
Kurisu: "I see. Then I’ll lecture you on how to escape. You’re in the same the place you were before, right?"
UNSPOKEN: The men are approaching our hiding spot. But because the room is dark, it seems they can’t tell where we are. I listen carefully to Kurisu’s voice.
Kurisu: "Scatter the flour and make a break for it. OK?"
UNSPOKEN: Scatter the flour?
Kurisu: "Then switch on the light."
UNSPOKEN: Now I get it.
Rintaro: "Roger. Over and out."
UNSPOKEN: Then, I see the light reflect off of something. One of the men has a butterfly knife. He opens the blade with a flourish.
Faris: "!?"
UNSPOKEN: I quickly rip open a nearby wheat flour sack and toss its contents into the air. The scattered white powder shines in the sunlight through the window.
Viral Attacker A: "What the hell!?"
Viral Attacker B: "I can’t see! Cough cough!"
UNSPOKEN: Slipping past the disoriented men, I carry Faris towards the exit. Right next to the exit, I see the light switch. I push Faris out first, then flip the switch right before shutting the door. Right as we get out-- A sound like firecrackers resounds from the other side of the door. A dust explosion. I’ve seen this same trick used by guys like MacDyver and Master Cheaton. That should distract them long enough for us to escape!
Faris: "Khohkhoh, khohkhohkhoh!"
UNSPOKEN: Faris coughs, shaking wheat flour off of her clothes and hair. But there’s no time to spare. The taxi still isn’t here. But it’s not like we can wait for it. We need to leave here now! I press the End Call button and shove the phone into my pocket. But it’s too late. They already heard it.
Viral Attacker A: "Hey, we found you!"
Viral Attacker B: "Hehhehhe! You can’t escape!"
UNSPOKEN: With brass knuckles in hand, one of the men starts grinning, baring his canines. We’re suddenly driven to the wall. Dammit! Is this the end!? It’s over. We’re done for.
Faris: "Oh no! 4℃ got run over by a car, nya!"
UNSPOKEN: Faris shouts and points to the window.
Viral Attacker A: "Wh-what!? 4℃-san!?"
UNSPOKEN: Faris rushes recklessly at the bewildered men-- Or so I thought, but she actually just slips between them. I follow. We race down the stairs at a breakneck pace.
Rintaro: "Nice feint, Faris!"
UNSPOKEN: However...
Viral Attacker C: "You’re not getting away!"
Viral Attacker D: "Get them!"
UNSPOKEN: Crap! We were headed for the lab, but got ambushed.
Faris: "Oh no..."
