UNSPOKEN: I rush the greeting and get down to business.
Rintaro: If I'm not mistaken, there was an old computer donated to this shrine about ten years ago. Do you know about it?
Luka’s Father: An old computer... why, yes, I do remember that.
Rintaro: Really!?
UNSPOKEN: Yes! Finally, I've returned to the worldline with the IBN 5100!
Rintaro: Please, I need to see it!
Luka’s Father: Sure. Please wait here.
UNSPOKEN: Luka's dad heads inside the sanctuary in the back. Lukako has been silent this whole time. She keeps touching her hair and looking around nervously. Something is definitely wrong with her.
Rintaro: Are you afraid of me, Lukako?
Luka: Eh?
Rintaro: I understand. I mean, I uh... touched your, uh, naughty bits, I guess...
UNSPOKEN: Crap, I just made things more awkward! I didn't have to say it like that!
Luka: I'm not... afraid of you, Okabe-san... That was really... embarrassing, though...
Rintaro: Sorry.
Luka: Okay...
Rintaro: By the way, do you know about the IBN 5100?
Luka: N-no!
UNSPOKEN: Lukako shakes her head in an unnatural way.
Luka: I've... never heard of it.
Rintaro: But when I called you before, it sounded like you knew about it.
Luka: No, I...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako is looking more and more uncomfortable. Maybe I'm pushing her too hard. I should back off. I did a terrible thing to this girl. So it might be best if I stop treating her as my disciple. I need to treat her like a lady from now on. If I don't, I could get sued for sexual harassment or charged with attempted rape or indecency or something. But how exactly do I treat her like a lady anyway? I just treat everyone the same, pretty much.
Rintaro: So, uh... you're not gonna wear the costume Mayuri made?
Luka: Oh... no...
Rintaro: Because it's embarrassing?
Luka: Yes...
UNSPOKEN: Why is this girl so lacking in confidence? I guess she can't help it if it's in her nature. But didn't she say her reason for becoming a girl was to gain confidence in the first place? And yet, she's a girl now, but she still seems the same inside.
Luka’s Father: That's strange...
UNSPOKEN: Luka's dad returns. His timing is good. My conversation with Lukako wasn't going anywhere.
Rintaro: Did you find it?
UNSPOKEN: I try asking just in case, but he looks confused. Obviously something unexpected has happened.
Luka’s Father: Well... I couldn't find it.
Rintaro: You couldn't find it?
Luka’s Father: I remember receiving an old computer, but it's not in the storehouse anymore.
UNSPOKEN: The IBN 5100 isn't here? I press my hands to my temples and stifle a groan. The worldline is still twisted. The IBN 5100 is like a mirage floating in front of me. I can see it but never reach it.
Rintaro: ...Pardon my asking, but the PC was donated by Akiha Rumiho-san, correct?
