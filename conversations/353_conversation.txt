UNSPOKEN: I’m no hero. If I had the strength, I would prostrate myself right now before this man.
Rintaro: "I wasn’t able to do anything against those guys. I was pathetic..."
Faris’s Dad: "Absolutely not. You saved my daughter’s life."
UNSPOKEN: He shakes my hand firmly in gratitude.
Faris: "Oh, Papa... I thought I told you not to push yourself since you’ve got important work to do. You should listen to me, nya."
UNSPOKEN: Faris looks happy as she says that. However... I recall what Faris told me in the ramen shop.
Faris: "The wish Faris made... ...was to save Papa, who died ten years ago, nya."
UNSPOKEN: If that’s true, then to return to the original worldline, I have to erase her father. To kill him, essentially.
Faris’s Dad: "I always keep my promises to you, Rumiho. I made that decision long ago."
Faris: "Papa... thank you, nya."
UNSPOKEN: The limousine soon reaches Faris’s home.
Faris’s Dad: "So you’re looking for an IBN 5100?"
Rintaro: "That’s right. I heard you were an enthusiastic retro PC collector. Do you know anything about it?"
UNSPOKEN: I end up eating dinner at Faris’s apartment. Faris’s father was extremely grateful to me and invited me up. I would’ve been okay with just borrowing the shower, but he even prepared a change of clothes for me. And he even told me I could stay since it’s still too dangerous to go outside. During the meal, I try asking about the IBN 5100, ignoring the pain I still feel throughout my body.
Faris’s Dad: "It’s quite unusual for a man your age to know about the IBN 5100."
UNSPOKEN: He smiles when I bring up his hobby of collecting old PCs.
Faris’s Dad: "I did have one. I gave it away, though."
Rintaro: "You... gave it away?"
