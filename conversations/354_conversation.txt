UNSPOKEN: No? All the strength drains from my body. Were my efforts for nothing?
Faris’s Dad: "I don’t think Hashida-san, who entrusted the IBN 5100 to me, could ever forgive me for what I did..."
Rintaro: "Hashida? As in Hashida Suzu?"
UNSPOKEN: Faris’s dad nods. Suzuha’s pseudonym. My pulse rises instantly upon hearing that name. She did it. She found an IBN 5100. She brought it to Akiba. She completed her mission. Tears well up in my eyes. I bite them back.
Faris’s Dad: "This is an old story... a story from before my company got as big as it is. Rumiho was kidnapped. The kidnapper demanded an unthinkable ransom. Maybe I should have mortgaged the company instead. But at that moment, someone appeared, like a godsend, offering a large sum of money to buy my IBN 5100. I sold it, which gave me enough to prepare Rumiho’s ransom."
Faris: "Let’s not talk about that, nya..."
UNSPOKEN: For some reason, Faris’s face turns red with embarrassment. If I had to say, her dad seems really happy to tell this story. Not something you’d expect from a kidnapping story.
Rintaro: "So who was the buyer?"
Faris’s Dad: "Hmm, a French businessman, I believe. I think I still have his contact information. Would you like it?"
UNSPOKEN: I politely decline the offer. There’s no way the IBN 5100 will arrive from France in time. And I doubt we could afford to pay for it anyway. Plus, there’s a high possibility the buyer is related to SERN, or to the Rounders. I clench my fist, then open it again. Why won’t you return to me, IBN 5100!? It’s well past midnight, and I’m still awake. My body hurts too much to sleep. And then there’s the question eating at my mind. What should I do? How can I cancel the D-Mail that saved Faris’s father? My encounter with the man himself has given birth to unnecessary internal conflict. I’m about to steal Faris’s father away from her. I need to do it to save Mayuri. But does that give me the right to play God? I hear a knock, and then the door opens.
Faris: "Kyouma?"
Rintaro: "Oh, Faris. Still awake?"
Faris: "May I come in?"
UNSPOKEN: Hm? Normally, Faris would have added nya to the end of that question. Without waiting for my answer, Faris steps inside. Then she sits next to me on the bed. She’s not wearing her cat ears.
Faris: "...Um. Thanks for earlier. When the Viral gang started chasing me, I was really scared."
