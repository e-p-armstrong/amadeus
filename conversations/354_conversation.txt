UNSPOKEN: By the time Kurisu starts talking, the discharge phenomenon has already started. An unpleasant sound pierces my ears. My vision ripples. My flesh and my soul momentarily feel separate. I grab my right wrist. I close my eyes, take deep breaths, and wait for my pulse to return to normal. I took two time leaps, traveling a total of 57 hours into the past.
Rintaro: Whew...
UNSPOKEN: The worst is over. All that's left is a headache. I need to cancel Lukako's D-Mail on this worldline. I sit down in a pipe chair and try to come up with a plan. ...I can always time leap later. I put away my phone and take a deep breath. I don't want to sacrifice anyone else. I know it's unreasonable, but I want to hope that nothing will happen on this worldline. A foolish dream, perhaps... but still. Nothing happens on the 14th. Moeka's group doesn't appear at the lab, and Mayuri doesn't get involved in any accidents. So far, so good. The problem is tomorrow. The time is 7:30 PM. My preparations are complete. The Time Leap Machine is set, Moad Snake is primed, and the remote control for the TV downstairs is ready. It's all second nature to me now. ComiMa started today, so Mayuri's been in Ariake since this morning. I told Daru not to come to the lab today, but to keep an eye on Mayuri instead. So even if Moeka's group shows up here, they have a low chance of killing Mayuri. Will the Rounders come on this worldline? We'll soon find out. 7:35. The door isn't kicked open. Instead... My phone rings. It's Daru.
Rintaro: Hello? Daru?
Itaru: Haa, ugh, gh, haah...
UNSPOKEN: Something's wrong.
Rintaro: Hey, what happened!? Daru!?
Itaru: I'm sor... some guys... came out of nowhere... they took Mayu-shi... I think... they wanted... me... I... ran... but Mayu-shi... What do I do, Okarin!?
UNSPOKEN: It's the Rounders. They kidnapped her. And then they probably killed her. To them, Mayuri is expendable. I grind my teeth in frustration. It didn't work. I still haven't averted Mayuri's death. I toss Moad Snake onto the couch. The preparations were a waste. Mayuri died somewhere else. I hang up and walk to the development room.
Rintaro: I won't let you kill Mayuri!
UNSPOKEN: And so, once more, I send my memories to the past. An unpleasant sound pierces my ears. My vision ripples. My flesh and my soul momentarily feel separate. I grab my right wrist. I close my eyes, take deep breaths, and wait for my pulse to return to normal.
Rintaro: Whew...
