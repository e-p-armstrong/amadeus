Rintaro: Yes. I have a difficult problem that requires... delicacy to resolve.
Kurisu: Delicacy? That's like the exact opposite of what anyone expects from you.
Rintaro: That's why I want to ask a girl. Plus, you're my assistant, so I need you to save my ass this instant.
Kurisu: Oh, you. Why do you need to ask a girl anyway?
UNSPOKEN: I give her the rundown -- including how many times I've time leaped, and what happened with Suzuha and Faris. How many times have I explained this to her now? This time, she believes me more readily than I expected. The only thing she doesn't believe is the story about Lukako.
Kurisu: Urushibara-san is actually a guy? That's totally ridiculous.
Rintaro: But it's the truth. Was the truth.
Kurisu: So basically, umm...
UNSPOKEN: She wrinkles her brow in thought.
Kurisu: She looked like Hashida?
UNSPOKEN: Crap, I got a mental image there for a second. Judging by her expression, so did Kurisu.
Rintaro & Kurisu: Ugh.
UNSPOKEN: We grimace.
Kurisu: Unacceptable! There's no way such a cute girl was a guy.
Rintaro: Hey, hold your horses. I never said that Lukako looked like a guy. He actually looked pretty much the same. He was always androgynous, so much you couldn't help but think he was secreting excess female hormones or something.
UNSPOKEN: As a result, I didn't even notice when Lukako became a girl at first, and made a fatal mistake.
Kurisu: He looked like she does now?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's gaze wanders for bit...
Kurisu: Acceptable.
UNSPOKEN: What?
Kurisu: Anyway. You want to turn her back into a guy?
Rintaro: Unless we do, Mayuri dies.
Kurisu: Mayuri's life is tied to Urushibara-san's gender... That's so crazy it doesn't seem real at all. Have you come up with a solution?
Rintaro: Of course. I'll have Lukako turn back into a guy.
Kurisu: I don't know if she's going to appreciate that.
Rintaro: That's why I'm consulting you, so I can find a way to do this while hurting her the least.
UNSPOKEN: I take a mouthful of Dr P in a vain attempt to quiet my frustration.
Rintaro: ...If only I hadn't been so careless. I shouldn't have let so many people send D-Mails.
UNSPOKEN: This is my punishment. I must shoulder the pain of everyone who used a D-Mail -- Suzuha, Faris, and now Lukako.
Kurisu: Regret won't change anything. There's only one piece of advice I can give.
UNSPOKEN: Christina sighs, blowing her bangs.
Kurisu: Don't say anything to Urushibara-san.
Rintaro: What do you mean?
Kurisu: Based on what you've told me, you have the advantage this time. You already know the contents of the D-Mail. So you don't have to tell her -- him? Ex-him? ...You don't have to tell Urushibara-san. Just send the cancellation D-Mail.
Rintaro: You mean pose as Lukako and send the mail to her mother myself?
Kurisu: If the worldline changes, then that will all be undone. In which case, ethical concerns don't really matter.
