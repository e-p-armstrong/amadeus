Rintaro: Just one problem. I don't know her mother's pager number.
Kurisu: What!? Are you an idiot!? Why didn't you write it down!?
Rintaro: I didn't think I would need it!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu clicks her tongue. She rubs her brow with her fingers while muttering and thinking.
Kurisu: What if you just ask for the pager number directly? Think up a good excuse.
Rintaro: That's going to look suspicious...
Kurisu: What are you so scared of? That's not the vain and arrogant Okabe I know.
UNSPOKEN: Vain and arrogant? That was uncalled for. I don't have time to be Hououin Kyouma now.
Kurisu: Just make up some nonsense like you always do. I mean, you know how gullible she is, right? ...Wow, I hate myself for saying that. I'm a bad girl.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu hangs her head.
Rintaro: Maybe I should just tell her the truth. Sincerity will work better than underhanded tricks... I think.
Kurisu: A mad scientist, sincere? That's a good one. It's more like you to say 'I'll brainwash her, muhahaha!'.
UNSPOKEN: I'm being serious, dammit!
Rintaro: I will shoulder Lukako's pain. That's my responsibility. When I cancel that D-Mail, the fact that she was a girl will be undone. I'm the only one who can carry that burden.
Kurisu: So what are you talking to me for? Go to her now, and tell her what you told me.
Rintaro: Yeah... you're right.
UNSPOKEN: That's my only choice. As always, there are only a few worshipers at the shrine. I guess that's how it can keep its dignified silence, even though it's less than a 10 minute walk from Akihabara Station.
Luka: Ah, Okabe-san...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako is sweeping the courtyard.
Luka: I-I'm sorry, I left Samidare in my room...
Rintaro: No, that's okay.
Luka: R-really?
UNSPOKEN: Well, crap. Now that we're face to face, I can't bring myself to tell her the truth.
Luka: Is... something wrong?
Rintaro: W-well...
UNSPOKEN: I recall Lukako's crying face. She looked very sad when I called her a guy. If possible, I don't want to make her cry again. No! Why am acting so weak!? I can't stop here. I swore I would do anything to save Mayuri. And when Lukako said he wanted to be a girl, he probably only said it out of curiosity. If I explain everything properly, I doubt she'll refuse to become a guy again.
Rintaro: Lukako!
Luka: Uh, yes!?
UNSPOKEN: I grab her by the shoulders and pull her close. Lukako's cheeks instantly turn bright red.
Rintaro: Please listen carefully. The truth is... You used to be a guy.
UNSPOKEN: ... ... ... ... ... No reaction. Or so I thought. Then tears start welling up in Lukako's eyes.
Luka: You're... saying that again? Sniff...
