UNSPOKEN: I feel my cheeks get warm, so I hang my head to hide my face.
Faris: "Faris... Doesn’t want to forget her time with Kyouma, nya."
Rintaro: "...Thank you."
UNSPOKEN: I take Faris’s phone. I’m sorry, Faris. I lied to you. When we change things back to the way they were, your memories of this worldline will almost certainly disappear. Perhaps another miracle will happen, and you’ll regain your memories of this worldline, too. But I can’t be sure. There are no guarantees. And so, I will engrave these memories onto my heart. The memory of Faris, the RaiNet Champion. The memory of her father, who gave thanks to a stranger like me for protecting his daughter. I will carry them for you. Always.
Faris: "Bye bye... Papa."
UNSPOKEN: It must be done. For Mayuri’s sake. I must erase Faris’s memories just as I did Suzuha’s. There’s... no other way. I give Faris back her phone.
Faris: "Kyouma...?"
UNSPOKEN: No.
Rintaro: "I won’t let this dream end yet."
UNSPOKEN: Don’t jump to conclusions. We should explore other methods. After all, her father’s life hangs in the balance.
Rintaro: "Let’s try another way. I... can’t kill your dad."
Faris: "Kyouma... I’m sorry, nya. Faris led you astray, nya."
Rintaro: "No, it’s okay. This is my decision."
UNSPOKEN: I don’t have what it takes to be a god. That burden is too much for me to bear. My head spins. I feel faint. Slowly, the world reasserts itself. I have teleported to the lab development room. Faris is standing next to me. Reading Steiner is telling me that the worldline has changed. Additionally, the injuries the Viral Attackers inflicted on my body have vanished. So has the pain. Faris is standing in the center of the room, looking around. The tears that were in her eyes just a moment ago are gone.
Faris: "Kyouma? Do you know where Faris’s phone went, nya?"
UNSPOKEN: Just a moment ago, Faris was fighting to hold back her tears. But that Faris is no more. In her place is the usual cute, cheerful Faris, with an impish smile on her face. I look at the phone in my hand. It’s not my phone, but one with several cute, girly cat doll phone straps attached.
Rintaro: "Here’s your phone."
Faris: "Nya?"
UNSPOKEN: Faris walks up to me with a teasing smile on her face. She pokes at my fingers with her index finger.
Faris: "Kyouma... did you see what was inside, nya?"
UNSPOKEN: Faris gently takes her phone from my hand.
Faris: "If you did see it, then please forget about it, nya. Can’t let that cat out of the bag, nya. Or else they will awaken, nya... Come on, Kyouma! You’re supposed to say something, nya! Like ’who the hell are they!?’ or something, nya!"
