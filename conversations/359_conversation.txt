UNSPOKEN: Before we sent the D-Mail, Faris said she didn’t want to forget. And I lied that she would surely remember.
Faris: "Kyouma’s acting weird, nya. You usually act all pompous and--nya!?"
UNSPOKEN: I embrace Faris suddenly, pulling her to me as tightly as I can.
Rintaro: "I’m sorry."
UNSPOKEN: Faris remembers nothing. Nothing about her victory at the RaiNet tournament. Nothing about our escape from the Viral Attackers. Nothing about her father riding up in his limousine to save her. Nothing about how we talked alone in her bedroom. Nothing. She remembers nothing. Everything that happened on that worldline was undone. What happens to that worldline, I don’t know. Maybe, like Suzuha said, it still exists as another possible worldline. Or maybe it ceased to exist the moment I sent the D-Mail. You’d have to be a god to observe each and every worldline, so it’s pointless to worry about it. But one thing is clear. I can never return to that worldline again. Faris can never see her father again.
Faris: "Kyouma? T-this is really bold of you, nya... Mayushii’s in the next room. She’ll find out, you know? Nyahaha..."
Rintaro: "I’m sorry..."
UNSPOKEN: The only thing I can do is apologize. On this worldline, Mayuri invited Faris to come hang out at the lab. Apparently, she came to see a costume Mayuri had made. Faris has work after this, so she soon leaves the lab. After seeing Faris off, I head towards Yanabayashi Shrine. On the way, I stop at Chuo-dori and take a look around.
Rintaro: "They’re back..."
UNSPOKEN: The moe stores exist again. Animate, Toranoana, Mandarake, Gamers, Lammtarra, Melon Books, Asobit City... They’ve all returned to the streets of Akiba. There’s a gigantic anime-themed banner hanging from the Sofmap building. Maids walk the street, handing out leaflets. Cosplaying girls advertise in storefronts. But the return of this familiar scenery brings no relief to my heart. There is only pain, for everything I see confirms that Faris has lost her father. But I can’t stop here. I shake my head and hurry to the shrine. On the way, I notice that the satellite is missing from Radi-Kan’s rooftop. Of course it is. Suzuha is gone. The thought brings a new pang of grief to my heart. Before this is over, how much more pain will I shoulder? I pass beneath the archway and enter the silent courtyard. I walk up to the main building and jab the intercom. After a few presses, I get a reply.
Luka: "Yes, who is... ah, Okabe-san."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako comes out. Girly as always, even though he’s a guy. No, wait. This Lukako is a genuine girl.
Rintaro: "Lukako, someone should have donated an old computer to the shrine several years ago. Can you ask your dad about it for me?"
