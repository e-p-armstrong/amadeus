Rintaro: Why do you ask?
Kurisu: Ah, no, just wondering! There's no hidden meaning, okay!?
Rintaro: Why are you mad? Also, your face is red.
Kurisu: Is not! A-anyway! You should go out with Urushibara-san!
Rintaro: ...Seriously?
Kurisu: Y-you don't like anyone else, right? Then answer her feelings, you dummy.
UNSPOKEN: What did I do to deserve this name-calling?
Rintaro: Mayuri dies in two days. I don't have time to play boyfriend.
Kurisu: Just go out with her.
Rintaro: ...Seriously?
Kurisu: If there's nobody you like, then there's no reason not to, is there? Get close and help her work through her feelings. Then she'll probably tell you what you need to know.
Rintaro: Mayuri dies in two days. I don't have time for that touchy-feely stuff.
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Kurisu's expression turns grave.
Kurisu: ...Only consider this as a last resort. If you're willing to hurt Urushibara-san, you can always take the information by force. She'll forget after the worldline changes, won't she? In that case, I think it's a valid option. But only when compared to Mayuri's death. ...I hate myself for suggesting this.
Rintaro: No, you're right. I need to consider every possible option. But I don't want to do that if there's any other choice.
UNSPOKEN: I'm not saying this for myself. From my perspective, when the worldline changes, everything until that point becomes undone. But what about from Lukako's perspective? What if this worldline continues after I leave it behind? The Lukako of this worldline will have to live with what I did to her. That possibility exists. Suzuha said that's not the case, but there's no way to be sure. And since I can't confirm or deny that possibility, I don't want to use Kurisu's last resort. Besides, I have the Time Leap Machine. And as long as I have it, I can repeat the days before Mayuri's death forever. Of course, there's still the danger of a time leap failure... In any case, the first thing I should do is have an honest talk with the girl in question. I hear the tweeting of small birds outside the window. It's nice and cool early in the morning, even though it's the middle of summer. Too bad the cicadas are already chirping. The sunlight's not too strong yet. I couldn't get a wink of sleep. I was up all night thinking about Lukako.
Mayuri: Okarin? Ah, there you are!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri enters the room and looks at me with a disapproving pout. She didn't say tutturuâ™ª It's rare to see her in such a bad mood.
Rintaro: You're early. It's still eight. Something happening today?
Mayuri: I'm here to scold you, Okarin!
UNSPOKEN: She gives me a glare that's more cute than frightening. She's never been very good at getting angry.
Mayuri: Mayushii's very disappointed in you!
