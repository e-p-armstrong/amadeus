Mayuri: You can't fool me, Okarin. You made Luka-chan cry, didn't you?
Rintaro: H-how did you...
Mayuri: Luka-chan told me. She said you said she was a guy.
Rintaro: Damn...
UNSPOKEN: Those two are close friends. I should have known Lukako would go to Mayuri first!
Mayuri: Why would you say such a mean thing, Okarin?
Rintaro: M-Mayuri, it doesn't involve you. This is a serious, confidential matter involving the Organization--
Mayuri: It does too involve me. Luka-chan is Mayushii's friend! If you don't tell me, we're not friends anymore, okay? I'm gonna quit being a lab mem!
UNSPOKEN: This is the first time I've ever seen Mayuri so angry. I'm not sure how to deal with this, honestly.
Mayuri: Why did you say such a mean thing?
UNSPOKEN: I did it to save you. But I can't say that. I don't have it in me to tell this innocent girl that she's fated to die in just two days. Come to think of it, was it a mistake to tell Lukako about Mayuri's murder? I did make sure to tell Lukako not to breathe a word of it.
Mayuri: ...You're worried about something, aren't you?
UNSPOKEN: She's sharp, even though she never seems to be thinking anything.
Mayuri: I can tell. I've been watching you longer than anyone, Okarin... And yesterday, you talked with Chris-chan for a looong time, didn't you? If something's wrong, you should talk to Mayushii too, okay? I want to help too... okay? Now, let's go apologize to Luka-chan. Will you do that for me? Mayushii will come too, so let's--
Rintaro: Heh... heh heh heh, muhahahaha!
Mayuri: O-Okarin?
Rintaro: Come now, Mayuri. Me, worry? Don't be ridiculous! I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma! I have nothing to worry about! All I have... is the hunger for chaos! Muhahahaha!
Mayuri: Okarin...
UNSPOKEN: I can't tell Mayuri. I can't. Even if Mayuri hates me for it. Something important? What? I told her everything yesterday, including about Mayuri's death. Perhaps, after sleeping on it, she finally decided to believe my story.
Rintaro: Alright...
UNSPOKEN: I get up from the sofa.
Mayuri: Where are you going? Mayushii's not done talking.
Rintaro: I'm going to Lukako's.
Mayuri: Really? You're going to apologize? Then let Mayushii come too!
Rintaro: No, that will just make it harder.
UNSPOKEN: I put my hand on Mayuri's shoulder.
Rintaro: Please, take care of the lab while I'm gone.
