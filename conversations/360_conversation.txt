UNSPOKEN: I awkwardly clear my throat and walk towards him -- uh, her. Lukako bows her head.
Luka: You came... Thank you.
UNSPOKEN: We stare at each other in silence. Crap. This is awkward. I can't stand the silence, so I try to start the conversation.
Rintaro: What did you tell Mayuri?
Luka: ...S-sorry. But Mayuri-chan's the only one I could talk to about this.
Rintaro: I mean, how much did you tell her?
Luka: I kept most of it a secret. Especially the stuff about her dying...
UNSPOKEN: That's a relief.
Rintaro: Do you still think I'm joking?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako shakes her head. She believes me?
Rintaro: Umm, you said you had something important to talk about, nya?
UNSPOKEN: I'm trying to be gentle, but for some reason I wind up talking like Faris. I really don't know how to deal with Lukako now that she's a girl.
Luka: ...Um.
UNSPOKEN: Lukako takes a deep breath, as if to prepare herself. Her face is turning red for some reason. She opens her mouth to speak, then closes it again. This continues for several cycles. What's wrong with her? Her tension is getting to me. My heart starts pounding like an alarm bell.
Luka: I...
Rintaro: Y-yes?
Luka: ...want to ask...
Rintaro: Yes?
Luka: Okabe-san... about what you said yesterday...
Rintaro: Yeah.
Luka: I... believe you.
Rintaro: T-that's great!
UNSPOKEN: So she's willing to go back to being a guy, even though I hurt her feelings! For her to believe me in spite of that makes me pretty happy. But something's strange about Lukako. She still looks wound up pretty tight. In fact, it's gotten worse. Now she looks on the verge of tears.
Luka: ...so, well... In exchange... for becoming a guy again...
UNSPOKEN: In exchange? She wants something in return? I wasn't expecting this.
Luka: For today... and tomorrow... We can stop... before Mayuri-chan is in danger...
UNSPOKEN: What? What is she talking about? My throat goes dry. I'm so tense and I don't know why.
Luka: ...so... Please be my...
Rintaro: ...Hm? I couldn't hear you. One more time.
UNSPOKEN: Lukako's voice was even softer than ever. So soft that I couldn't hear her from here.
Luka: Please be my b...end
UNSPOKEN: No good, I still can't hear her.
Rintaro: Speak up. I'll do anything I can.
Luka: Boy...end...
Rintaro: What?
Luka: P-please be my boyfriend!
UNSPOKEN: ......... What? B o y f r i e n d. It takes me a while to process the word. Meanwhile, Lukako starts squirming and fidgeting. She refuses to look me in the eye. My heart is pounding. What's going on? What did she say to me? B o y f r i e n d. Boy friend. Boyfriend. She wants me to be her boyfriend until tomorrow? WHAT!?
Rintaro: Wh-why?
UNSPOKEN: Without thinking, I ask the worst possible question. Lukako curls up even smaller.
Luka: I... ...like you.
