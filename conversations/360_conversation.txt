Luka: "Eh?"
Rintaro: "I understand. I mean, I uh... touched your, uh, naughty bits, I guess..."
UNSPOKEN: Crap, I just made things more awkward! I didn’t have to say it like that!
Luka: "I’m not... afraid of you, Okabe-san... That was really... embarrassing, though..."
Rintaro: "Sorry."
Luka: "Okay..."
Rintaro: "By the way, do you know about the IBN 5100?"
Luka: "N-no!"
UNSPOKEN: Lukako shakes her head in an unnatural way.
Luka: "I’ve... never heard of it."
Rintaro: "But when I called you before, it sounded like you knew about it."
Luka: "No, I..."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako is looking more and more uncomfortable. Maybe I’m pushing her too hard. I should back off. I did a terrible thing to this girl. So it might be best if I stop treating her as my disciple. I need to treat her like a lady from now on. If I don’t, I could get sued for sexual harassment or charged with attempted rape or indecency or something. But how exactly do I treat her like a lady anyway? I just treat everyone the same, pretty much.
Rintaro: "So, uh... you’re not gonna wear the costume Mayuri made?"
Luka: "Oh... no..."
Rintaro: "Because it’s embarrassing?"
Luka: "Yes..."
UNSPOKEN: Why is this girl so lacking in confidence? I guess she can’t help it if it’s in her nature. But didn’t she say her reason for becoming a girl was to gain confidence in the first place? And yet, she’s a girl now, but she still seems the same inside.
Luka’s Father: "That’s strange..."
UNSPOKEN: Luka’s dad returns. His timing is good. My conversation with Lukako wasn’t going anywhere.
Rintaro: "Did you find it?"
UNSPOKEN: I try asking just in case, but he looks confused. Obviously something unexpected has happened.
Luka’s Father: "Well... I couldn’t find it."
Rintaro: "You couldn’t find it?"
Luka’s Father: "I remember receiving an old computer, but it’s not in the storehouse anymore."
UNSPOKEN: The IBN 5100 isn’t here? I press my hands to my temples and stifle a groan. The worldline is still twisted. The IBN 5100 is like a mirage floating in front of me. I can see it but never reach it.
Rintaro: "...Pardon my asking, but the PC was donated by Akiha Rumiho-san, correct?"
