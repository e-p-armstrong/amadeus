UNSPOKEN: There are two girls in the lab -- Mayuri and Kurisu.
Rintaro: "Who is this ’Karin’?"
Mayuri: "Well, ’welcome back’ flows so well into ’Okarin,’ doesn’t it? When you put them together, it’s doubly delicious."
Rintaro: "It’s not delicious."
Mayuri: "It’s a greeting I can only use for Okarin, so why not? Ehehe!"
Rintaro: "Where’s Daru?"
Mayuri: "Hmm, probably at MayQueen?"
Rintaro: "MayQueen..."
UNSPOKEN: So that’s back too.
Rintaro: "So when Faris said she had work, she meant at MayQueen... What about you, Mayuri? You work there too, don’t you?"
Mayuri: "’Course I do! You know that, Okarin. You’re so weird! Mayushii’s taking a break to prepare for ComiMa tomorrow."
