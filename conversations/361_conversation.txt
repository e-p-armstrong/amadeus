UNSPOKEN: I turn and flee like a scared rabbit. I'm so embarrassed, I can't look back. Ten minutes later, I get back to the lab. Mayuri's eating a red bean bun.
Mayuri: Okarin! How'd it go? Did you apologize to Luka-chan?
Rintaro: Uh, yeah. So put the Juicy Chicken Number One in the microwave and nuke it so that the D-Mail's basically ABC and...
Mayuri: Huwha?
Rintaro: The microwave was developed by knights of the Rosicrucian Order who used alchemy. Meaning that the sound of the chime is the brainwashing device, while the chime itself actually doesn't have any meaning at all...
Mayuri: Waaah, Okarin's broken!
UNSPOKEN: I mutter incoherently as I set up the Time Leap Machine.
Mayuri: What are you doing?
Rintaro: M-making a tactical retreat.
Mayuri: Retreat...?
UNSPOKEN: How far do I go? As far as I can. Yeah, that's it. Far. Far away from here. I jump all the way back to August 11th, the limit of the Time Leap Machine's range. When I'm done, Kurisu is standing before me, fiddling with the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s wiring.
Kurisu: Stop staring. You're distracting me. How many times do I have to tell you?
UNSPOKEN: She's still working on the Time Leap Machine upgrade. I know I shouldn't interrupt her, but there's nobody else I can rely on.
Rintaro: Genius neuroscientist, I need to talk to you.
Kurisu: Make it short.
Rintaro: I want you to come with me to Yanabayashi Shrine.
Kurisu: Tell me why. If it's a date or something, then I refuse.
Rintaro: H-Hououin Kyouma does not go on dates. Much less with his assistant. Ridiculous.
UNSPOKEN: She's glaring like she's gonna kill me. Let's leave the jokes aside for now...
Rintaro: S-so... I need you to explain the differences between the male brain and the female brain.
Kurisu: What.
UNSPOKEN: I briefly explain my situation and what happened with Lukako before I leaped. How many times have I explained this to Kurisu now?
Luka: Okabe-san... and Makise-san. Did you come to pray?
UNSPOKEN: Not exactly...
Kurisu: A-ahem. Actually, we have something to talk to you about, Urushibara-san.
UNSPOKEN: This is the strategy I thought up. Its name is Operation Christina. Lukako reacts differently to me. I already know she'll have a breakdown if I tell her she's a guy. But she's not too familiar with Kurisu, and they're both girls, so it should be easier if Kurisu tells her. That's why I forced -- I mean, persuaded Kurisu to handle it. So I wait behind Kurisu and watch silently.
Luka: What might that be?
