UNSPOKEN: What the hell is she talking about?
Kurisu: Actually, these theories are kinda fringe. They're not really that credible. So if you don't mind, I'd like to do an experiment.
Luka: A-an experiment?
Kurisu: I want to try mapping your brain patterns to see if they're more female or male.
Luka: What is mapping...?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako's clearly frightened.
Kurisu: Brainwave mapping. We just take a sample of your brainwaves. Anyway, you'll understand if you try it. Okay? Okay? It won't hurt a bit.
Luka: N-no thanks...
Kurisu: It'll be okay, I promise. It won't hurt a bit. Just come to the lab and we'll--
Rintaro: What kind of perverted old man are you!?
UNSPOKEN: I lightly chop Kurisu on the head.
Kurisu: Fwahn! Wh-what!?
Rintaro: Don't you what me! What did we come here for!? What are you going to do if you scare Lukako away!?
Kurisu: I'm just treating her like a valuable test sub--
Rintaro: Go back to the lab, you experiment-loving girl!
Kurisu: Yeah, okay. So that's the thanks I get for going out of my way to help you. I'm gone. You're on your own now.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu leaves the shrine with squared shoulders, muttering darkly to herself.
Luka: Um... what was Makise-san talking about?
Rintaro: Well, basically...
UNSPOKEN: D-do I have to explain it myself after all?
Rintaro: Y-you're actually a guy.
UNSPOKEN: The result is the same, of course. I hear the tweeting of small birds outside the window. It's morning now. It's nice and cool early in the morning, even though it's the middle of summer. Too bad the cicadas are already chirping. The sun's not too strong yet. This is the second time I've woken up like this, though the date was different the first time. In any case, my mental state is exactly the same as back then. Through the front door, I hear someone stomping up the stairs. I jump up, thinking it's Moeka, but then I realize who it is.
Mayuri: Okarin? There you are!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri enters and greets me with a disapproving pout. Originally, Mayuri was supposed to stay over at the lab, but last night she got a call from someone and left in a hurry. ...She probably went to see Lukako.
Mayuri: Mayushii's very disappointed in you!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri puffs out her cheeks and thrusts a finger at me. Of course... I sigh in frustration. Before I time leaped, this happened on the 14th. Today is the 12th. Since I explained the situation to Lukako early, it looks like Mayuri's protest came early too.
Mayuri: You made Luka-chan cry, didn't you? Luka-chan told me. She said you said she was a guy. Why would you say such a mean thing, Okarin?
Rintaro: ...I'm going to see her now, so don't worry.
Mayuri: R-really? Thank goodness. If you weren't gonna apologize, then Mayushii was never gonna talk to you again.
