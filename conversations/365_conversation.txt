UNSPOKEN: Damn! I made her cry again. But this time, I don’t back down.
Rintaro: "Listen! Unless you turn back into a guy... Mayuri will die."
Luka: "Eh..."
UNSPOKEN: I explain everything. About time travel. About the D-Mail Lukako sent. About Mayuri’s fate. About how to avoid it. I talk and talk without pausing for breath. Finally, I’m done.
Luka: "You’re... joking, right?"
UNSPOKEN: Her voice is trembling.
Luka: "I can’t... believe any of it... This is more roleplaying, right? You’re being Kyouma-san, right? Right?"
UNSPOKEN: She backs away from me, shaking her head.
Luka: "I don’t like that backstory. It hurts... and I think it would hurt Mayuri-chan too..."
Rintaro: "I know you’re confused, hearing this so suddenly. But it’s all true. I’ve witnessed her death countless times. I’m sorry. I know I’m being selfish. But I’m begging you. To save Mayuri... I need you to become a guy again."
Luka: "Please tell me you’re joking, Okabe-san... I can’t possibly be a guy... I don’t want to be... I’ve always been a girl... ever since I was born. This is cruel. And why do I have to hear it... from you, of all people? I’m so embarrassed... sniff... this isn’t right..."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako covers her face with both hands to snuff out her sobs.
Rintaro: "What’s to be embarrassed about? I have a harder time thinking of you as a girl anyway."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako jerks like someone poked her with a cattle prod. Her crying has stopped. Um... What did I do!?
Luka: "...that’s how... you... of me..."
Rintaro: "What? I couldn’t hear you."
UNSPOKEN: She lowers her hands and looks at me. Then she smiles... a soft, sorrowful smile.
Luka: "So that’s how you think of me..."
UNSPOKEN: Then, Lukako shakes off my hands and runs away.
Rintaro: "Lukako! Wait!!"
UNSPOKEN: She doesn’t stop even when I call her. She disappears into the shrine office. It turned out just as my mental simulations predicted. I sigh and leave the shrine, dejected. I need to come up with a plan... When I get back to the lab, I take Kurisu out to the bench and explain what happened. Kurisu listens with an annoyed expression the whole time. When I finish, she glares at me and says--
Kurisu: "You raised a flag."
Rintaro: "What are you talking about?"
Kurisu: "Don’t you get it? You raised a flag. Or I guess you could say you tripped over a flag that was already raised."
Rintaro: "You mean a death flag?"
Kurisu: "Why!? It’s a romance flag, genius."
Rintaro: "Wha...!"
UNSPOKEN: A... romance flag?
Kurisu: "Urushibara-san likes you."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu thrusts her finger at me.
Kurisu: "When her beloved Hououin Kyouma told her she was a guy, it tore her pure maidenly heart into tiny little pieces. In other words, your plan was a massive failure."
