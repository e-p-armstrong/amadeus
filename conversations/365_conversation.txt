Luka: Eh...?
Rintaro: I'll go out with you. But only until the 15th.
Luka: Ah...
UNSPOKEN: Tears immediately fall from Lukako's eyes.
Rintaro: Wh-why are you crying!?
Luka: Sniff... I'm h-happy... I was sure that you'd say no... Thank goodness... thank goodness... sniff...
UNSPOKEN: Her face is red, and her eyes are wet with tears, yet she's really happy. Seeing her like this, all shy and embarrassed but happy at the same time, makes me feel-- She's... too cute! I mustn't fall in love, but I'm about to! Why does every single one of her actions have to be so cute? She must be doing it on purpose! There's no other way! Lukako's cuteness is a terror of the universe.
Luka: ...Um, Okabe-san?
Rintaro: Wh-what!?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako wipes her tears away.
Luka: Um... tomorrow... a da...
UNSPOKEN: Da? What does she mean by da?
Luka: Please... take me... on a date.
Rintaro: What...did you say...?
UNSPOKEN: A date...? True, when a couple goes somewhere together, that's called a date. It would really be a dick move if I refused to go on a date right after we started going out.
Rintaro: Okay, but where?
Luka: Eh...
UNSPOKEN: Doesn't look like she's got a place in mind.
Luka: I want to go where you want to go, Okabe-san... Um, I want to know more about the places you frequent, Okabe-san...
UNSPOKEN: So in other words, she wants me to decide for her? It's really unfair to be so cute. People will forgive you for anything you say. I scratch my head in thought.
Rintaro: ...Then I'll come up with something by tomorrow.
UNSPOKEN: For now, I just want to get out of this sickeningly sweet atmosphere that's brewing. We arrange to meet tomorrow morning. Then I quickly leave the shrine behind. I breathe a sigh of relief at the sparsity of pedestrians on Manseibashi bridge.
Kurisu: Well?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu is walking behind me. She was completely useless.
Kurisu: Did you agree to go out with her? Well, I can kind of guess based on Urushibara-san's reaction.
Rintaro: Wait, you saw that!?
Kurisu: You told me to watch, didn't you?
UNSPOKEN: Oh yeah... I was expecting her to give me advice. Guess I should've known better.
Rintaro: ...We're going on a date tomorrow.
Kurisu: Yeah?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu makes a small nasal sound. She hasn't been making eye contact.
Kurisu: Our insane mad scientist is dating a high school girl. That's not insane at all.
Rintaro: Gh...
UNSPOKEN: Damn you, Kurisu. Must you always be so cynical? Let's just ignore her and get to the lab. But just as I quicken my pace, she grabs my shoulder and pulls me back. I almost fall down backwards.
Rintaro: What was that for!?
Kurisu: Sorry. I didn't mean to be snippy. I'm just a little irritated.
