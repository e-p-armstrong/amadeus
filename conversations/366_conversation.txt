Kurisu: "Love is trouble. There’s no formula for calculating people’s feelings. Too many unknowns to solve for."
UNSPOKEN: She shakes her head like she can’t imagine anything worse. Has this girl never been in love?
Kurisu: "The direct approach was a mistake. It’ll be even harder to persuade her now. You should think of another way this time. Like asking her mother directly. Though I’m sure the Urushibara family already thinks of you as the man who made their daughter cry. So they might have their guard up."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako likes me? I don’t want to believe it. I mean, I appreciate the sentiment, but...
Rintaro: "Um... when do you think I first set off that romance flag?"
Kurisu: "How should I know?"
Rintaro: "I mean, think about it. Lukako was a guy last week. If he already liked me at that point, then..."
UNSPOKEN: Uh-oh.
Kurisu: "That’s just your perspective. From everyone else’s perspective, she was always a girl. It makes perfect sense. Think in terms of the current worldline."
UNSPOKEN: R-right. It makes perfect sense. Still...
Kurisu: "Anyway, there’s a bigger problem. Will changing Urushibara-san’s gender to male really bring the IBN 5100 back?"
Rintaro: "Something is different from the previous worldline. According to Lukako’s father, the IBN 5100 was definitely at Yanabayashi Shrine. Suzuha gave it to Faris’s dad. After he died, Faris donated it to Yanabayashi Shrine... That sequence is the same as on the worldline where I obtain the IBN 5100."
Kurisu: "So you’re gradually approaching the original worldline. You know, I’ve been thinking. You really shouldn’t be able to change the worldline so easily."
Rintaro: "What makes you say that?"
Kurisu: "I mean, there are six billion people in the world. It doesn’t make sense that switching a single person’s gender could cause such a huge change in the worldline."
Rintaro: "According to Suzuha, taking different actions after a time leap will only change divergence by around 0. 000001%, if at all. But when I canceled Faris’s D-Mail, there was a 0. 05% change."
Kurisu: "0. 05% is pretty big. What did Amane-san have to say about that?"
Rintaro: "The year 2010 is a major attractor field junction, and the key is whether or not I obtain an IBN 5100."
Kurisu: "Maybe the divergence meter actually measures your distance to the IBN 5100... In any case, what you’re saying is that all of the D-Mails we sent had an influence on the IBN 5100’s location somehow?"
Rintaro: "There were also some D-Mails that didn’t activate Reading Steiner."
Kurisu: "Hmmm. So just cancel the D-Mails that activated Reading Steiner, and the IBN 5100 might come back to you."
