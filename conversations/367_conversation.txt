UNSPOKEN: I don’t want to see that woman again if I can help it. In any case, I should focus on Lukako right now.
Rintaro: "So what should I do about Lukako?"
Kurisu: "Well, you tripped a romance flag, so... Hmm..."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu ponders this for a while.
Kurisu: "...Ah!"
UNSPOKEN: Then she blushes, for some reason, and turns away.
Kurisu: "B-by the way, Okabe. Is there... someone you like? Wh-why aren’t you answering?"
Rintaro: "Not really."
UNSPOKEN: For a second, Mayuri’s face floated through my mind. But I feel more of a need to protect her, rather than romantic love for her.
Kurisu: "Oh... okay."
Rintaro: "Why do you ask?"
Kurisu: "Ah, no, just wondering! There’s no hidden meaning, okay!?"
Rintaro: "Why are you mad? Also, your face is red."
Kurisu: "Is not! A-anyway! You should go out with Urushibara-san!"
Rintaro: "...Seriously?"
Kurisu: "Y-you don’t like anyone else, right? Then answer her feelings, you dummy."
UNSPOKEN: What did I do to deserve this name-calling?
Rintaro: "Mayuri dies in two days. I don’t have time to play boyfriend."
Kurisu: "Just go out with her."
Rintaro: "...Seriously?"
Kurisu: "If there’s nobody you like, then there’s no reason not to, is there? Get close and help her work through her feelings. Then she’ll probably tell you what you need to know."
Rintaro: "Mayuri dies in two days. I don’t have time for that touchy-feely stuff."
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Kurisu’s expression turns grave.
Kurisu: "...Only consider this as a last resort. If you’re willing to hurt Urushibara-san, you can always take the information by force. She’ll forget after the worldline changes, won’t she? In that case, I think it’s a valid option. But only when compared to Mayuri’s death. ...I hate myself for suggesting this."
Rintaro: "No, you’re right. I need to consider every possible option. But I don’t want to do that if there’s any other choice."
