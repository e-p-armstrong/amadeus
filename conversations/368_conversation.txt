UNSPOKEN: Mayuri enters the room and looks at me with a disapproving pout. She didn’t say tutturu♪ It’s rare to see her in such a bad mood.
Rintaro: "You’re early. It’s still eight. Something happening today?"
Mayuri: "I’m here to scold you, Okarin!"
UNSPOKEN: She gives me a glare that’s more cute than frightening. She’s never been very good at getting angry.
Mayuri: "Mayushii’s very disappointed in you!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri puffs out her cheeks and thrusts a finger at me.
Rintaro: "What did I do?"
Mayuri: "You can’t fool me, Okarin. You made Luka-chan cry, didn’t you?"
Rintaro: "H-how did you..."
Mayuri: "Luka-chan told me. She said you said she was a guy."
Rintaro: "Damn..."
UNSPOKEN: Those two are close friends. I should have known Lukako would go to Mayuri first!
Mayuri: "Why would you say such a mean thing, Okarin?"
Rintaro: "M-Mayuri, it doesn’t involve you. This is a serious, confidential matter involving the Organization--"
Mayuri: "It does too involve me. Luka-chan is Mayushii’s friend! If you don’t tell me, we’re not friends anymore, okay? I’m gonna quit being a lab mem!"
UNSPOKEN: This is the first time I’ve ever seen Mayuri so angry. I’m not sure how to deal with this, honestly.
Mayuri: "Why did you say such a mean thing?"
UNSPOKEN: I did it to save you. But I can’t say that. I don’t have it in me to tell this innocent girl that she’s fated to die in just two days. Come to think of it, was it a mistake to tell Lukako about Mayuri’s murder? I did make sure to tell Lukako not to breathe a word of it.
Mayuri: "...You’re worried about something, aren’t you?"
UNSPOKEN: She’s sharp, even though she never seems to be thinking anything.
Mayuri: "I can tell. I’ve been watching you longer than anyone, Okarin... And yesterday, you talked with Chris-chan for a looong time, didn’t you? If something’s wrong, you should talk to Mayushii too, okay? I want to help too... okay? Now, let’s go apologize to Luka-chan. Will you do that for me? Mayushii will come too, so let’s--"
Rintaro: "Heh... heh heh heh, muhahahaha!"
Mayuri: "O-Okarin?"
Rintaro: "Come now, Mayuri. Me, worry? Don’t be ridiculous! I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma! I have nothing to worry about! All I have... is the hunger for chaos! Muhahahaha!"
Mayuri: "Okarin..."
UNSPOKEN: I can’t tell Mayuri. I can’t. Even if Mayuri hates me for it. Something important? What? I told her everything yesterday, including about Mayuri’s death. Perhaps, after sleeping on it, she finally decided to believe my story.
Rintaro: "Alright..."
