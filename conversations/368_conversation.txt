Rintaro: Heh! Who am I? I am the great Hououin Kyouma, bearer of the mightiest brain since Einstein himself, the insane mad scientist who will bring chaos to the world! Muhahaha!
Low-Angler A: Wh-what's with this guy?
Low-Angler B: He's nuts.
Rintaro: Stop right there. This miko clearly does not want your attention!
Low-Angler A: G-get out of here, chuunibyou!
Low-Angler B: You trying to be cool and save a girl for smex in return? You're just another pervert!
Rintaro: Look in the mirror when you say that. You're the ones harassing this frail girl, forcing her to take perverted pictures. Have you no otaku pride?
Luka: Um, I'm a...
Rintaro: A cameraman who frightens a sacred miko is no cameraman at all! He's nothing but lowlife scum, unfit to walk the holy streets of Akiba!
Low-Angler A: Wh-what!? Everyone's aiming for low-angle shots of cute 3D girls!
Low-Angler B: Amateur cosplayers should take what they get. When you cosplay in Akiba, you're asking to get photographed! That's how it works.
Luka: N-no... I... I'm... A guy!
UNSPOKEN: Instantly, our jaws dropped to the ground.
Luka: So... there's no point in photographing me...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako murmured sadly.
Low-Angler A: R-really?
Low-Angler B: No way. Someone this cute can't be a guy...
Luka: I am a guy.... I even have an Adam's apple...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako lifted his chin a bit, exposing his pale neck. That gesture was really sexy, but... There was indeed a lump on his neck.
Low-Angler A: Then, you've got one down there, too?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako nodded, reluctantly. He was already crying by that point. So were the cameramen.
Low-Angler B: Wh-what the hell? This is fraud!
Low-Angler A: What kind of guy wears miko robes? You some kinda pervert?
Low-Angler B: Thank god I didn't take a picture! I feel tricked.
UNSPOKEN: They left the place, mumbling complaints all the while. Those bastards were a disgrace to otaku everywhere. Daru would've said something like... Someone this cute can't be a girl! So you're a trap? Awesome! Daru is the true otaku.
Luka: Um, thank you very much...
Rintaro: Hm? Nah, it's nothing.
Luka: But you're disappointed that you saved a guy, aren't you? I'm sorry... I can't live up to your expectations.
Rintaro: ...What's your name?
Luka: Eh? Urushibara... Luka.
Rintaro: Why are you apologizing?
Luka: I mean... I look like this... but I'm a guy...
Rintaro: It matters not!
Luka: ...!?
Rintaro: It doesn't matter if you're a guy or a girl! We need to work on that inferiority complex of yours.
Luka: Eh? Eh...?
Rintaro: Come with me! I shall bestow upon you a mighty gift! An item that will give you courage. I'm sure you, too, have noticed the true power that sleeps inside of you.
