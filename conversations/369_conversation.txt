Rintaro: "I’m going to Lukako’s."
Mayuri: "Really? You’re going to apologize? Then let Mayushii come too!"
Rintaro: "No, that will just make it harder."
UNSPOKEN: I put my hand on Mayuri’s shoulder.
Rintaro: "Please, take care of the lab while I’m gone."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri’s shoulders droop. She looks sad for some reason, but she lets me go. When I reach the shrine, I find Lukako standing alone in the courtyard. She’s dressed in regular clothes instead of her miko garb. She still hasn’t noticed me. Lukako stands still in the silent courtyard. The only movement comes from the trees swaying in the summer breeze. It’s like a scene from a movie. I stop and watch in fascination. Finally, Lukako turns around. Our eyes meet.
Rintaro: "...Ahem."
UNSPOKEN: I awkwardly clear my throat and walk towards him -- uh, her. Lukako bows her head.
Luka: "You came... Thank you."
UNSPOKEN: We stare at each other in silence. Crap. This is awkward. I can’t stand the silence, so I try to start the conversation.
Rintaro: "What did you tell Mayuri?"
Luka: "...S-sorry. But Mayuri-chan’s the only one I could talk to about this."
Rintaro: "I mean, how much did you tell her?"
Luka: "I kept most of it a secret. Especially the stuff about her dying..."
UNSPOKEN: That’s a relief.
Rintaro: "Do you still think I’m joking?"
UNSPOKEN: Lukako shakes her head. She believes me?
Rintaro: "Umm, you said you had something important to talk about, nya?"
UNSPOKEN: I’m trying to be gentle, but for some reason I wind up talking like Faris. I really don’t know how to deal with Lukako now that she’s a girl.
Luka: "...Um."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako takes a deep breath, as if to prepare herself. Her face is turning red for some reason. She opens her mouth to speak, then closes it again. This continues for several cycles. What’s wrong with her? Her tension is getting to me. My heart starts pounding like an alarm bell.
Luka: "I..."
Rintaro: "Y-yes?"
Luka: "...want to ask..."
Rintaro: "Yes?"
Luka: "Okabe-san... about what you said yesterday..."
Rintaro: "Yeah."
Luka: "I... believe you."
Rintaro: "T-that’s great!"
UNSPOKEN: So she’s willing to go back to being a guy, even though I hurt her feelings! For her to believe me in spite of that makes me pretty happy. But something’s strange about Lukako. She still looks wound up pretty tight. In fact, it’s gotten worse. Now she looks on the verge of tears.
Luka: "...so, well... In exchange... for becoming a guy again..."
UNSPOKEN: In exchange? She wants something in return? I wasn’t expecting this.
Luka: "For today... and tomorrow... We can stop... before Mayuri-chan is in danger..."
UNSPOKEN: What? What is she talking about? My throat goes dry. I’m so tense and I don’t know why.
Luka: "...so... Please be my..."
Rintaro: "...Hm? I couldn’t hear you. One more time."
