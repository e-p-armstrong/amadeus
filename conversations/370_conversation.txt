Rintaro: What's wrong? You desire power... don't you?
Luka: Umm... p-power?
Rintaro: Indeed. I can grant you power. All you need is the will, the desire, the hunger! Never again will you fear a camera lens!
Luka: After that, we went to BladeWorks and you bought me Samidare. I didn't expect that.
Rintaro: Ah, well...
UNSPOKEN: I didn't expect he'd actually come with me. But when he did, I realized that he had potential. That's why I bought him the 980 yen (tax included) demon sword. Afterwards, Lukako and I went through intense training to develop the Seishin Zanma school of swordsmanship. In retrospect, I can't believe I said all that ridiculous stuff. It makes me want to crawl in a hole and hide.
Luka: I was really surprised when you said it didn't matter... but at the same time... it really made me happy. It's strange, huh. Those words really moved me.
UNSPOKEN: Lukako's cheeks then turn rosy pink. Her blush is too powerful. I have to look away.
Luka: Ever since you said those words... I've liked you.
UNSPOKEN: Wait a second... Wait a second. Wait a goddamn second! Is she saying what I think she's saying? But that Lukako was a guy! Does that mean I made the guy Lukako fall in love with me? My mind goes blank. Oh god! By the time I drop her off back at the shrine, I'm worn out physically and mentally. We ended up walking for four hours straight, which was tiring, but my mental exhaustion is greater. In the end, we didn't talk much. We just walked.
Luka: Today... was really fun.
Rintaro: R-really?
UNSPOKEN: She's just saying that out of consideration. I can tell that she's forcing her smile. All through the date, I couldn't stop thinking about the time Lukako fell in love with me, so I barely made conversation at all. That manual was completely useless. On this worldline, Lukako was a girl from the beginning, so Lukako's memories of when we first met might be inconsistent with mine. But even with that in consideration, Lukako's story still felt out of place.
Luka: So... um...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako fidgets as she whispers.
Rintaro: Wh-what is it?
Luka: Well... tomorrow...
Rintaro: Ah... eh?
UNSPOKEN: She wants to go on a date again tomorrow? I mean, we are a couple, and we are going out, and that means we like each other, and it's summer break right now, so it's natural to go on a date every day...
Luka: I want to be with Okabe-san again... tomorrow.
Rintaro: T-thanks...
Luka: Is that... okay?
Rintaro: Of course it is. Yes. Of course.
Luka: Thank goodness...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako smiles again. She looks so happy and relieved. Seeing her like this makes incomprehensible feelings well up inside me.
Luka: Well, see you tomorrow...
UNSPOKEN: I feel a huge weight on my shoulders. Another date tomorrow... Tomorrow...
