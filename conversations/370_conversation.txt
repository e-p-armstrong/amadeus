UNSPOKEN: When I return to the lab, I am greeted by Mayuri's smile and Daru's pure hatred.
Itaru: Since when does a chuunibyou patient like you rate a girlfriend? It's not right, man.
Mayuri: How'd your date with Luka-chan go?
Rintaro: Well... Stage Clear, somehow. Probably.
UNSPOKEN: Probably not, actually.
Mayuri: ComiMa's the day after tomorrow, you know? What if you and Luka-chan go as a cosplay couple? Maybe you can persuade her to go, now that you're her boyfriend. She never says yes to me. And I've asked her so many times, too. But if Okarin asks her, then I'm sure she'll say OK!
Rintaro: I refuse.
Mayuri: Eh? Why?
UNSPOKEN: Because ComiMa is on the 15th. Mayuri is fated to die that night. How am I supposed to spend the hours before her death cosplaying at ComiMa?
Rintaro: To be honest, I don't get this dating thing.
Itaru: Geh!? Okarin, you idiot, those words are an insult to virgins the world over! Apologize! Apologize to the virgins!
Rintaro: Just think about it. All you do is walk, eat, and go home. And the whole time, you have to worry about what your partner is thinking. What's fun about that?
Mayuri: Don't say that, Okarin. You'll make Luka-chan sad.
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri's expression is uncharacteristically serious.
Mayuri: You know... just being with the person she likes is enough to make a girl happy. That's all she really needs. Doesn't being together make boys happy too? If not... that makes Mayuri sad.
UNSPOKEN: Why would that make Mayuri sad?
Itaru: Okarin's the minority. I mean, dates are a great opportunity for H-scenes.
Rintaro: You're an idiot.
Itaru: Come on! Holding hands and stuff's pretty H, isn't it? And when you're arm-in-arm and her boob hits your elbow, that's like super mega H! And then at the end of the date, you kiss, right!? Damn you! Death to normals!
Rintaro: You play too much eroge.
Mayuri: Hey, hey. When did Luka-chan fall for Okarin?
Rintaro: When? Well...
Luka: I was really surprised when you said it didn't matter... but at the same time... it really made me happy. Ever since you said those words... I've liked you.
UNSPOKEN: I think back on what she said. Something still feels off about her story. I said that Luka's gender didn't matter. I remember that clearly. But didn't I say that because Lukako was a guy?
Rintaro: ...Right. That doesn't make sense.
UNSPOKEN: Now I know what feels out of place. I wouldn't have said that to a female Lukako. So why does this Lukako remember what I said back then? I recall what happened with Faris.
Faris: ...I remember, nya! The wish Faris made... ...Was to save Papa, who died ten years ago, nya.
