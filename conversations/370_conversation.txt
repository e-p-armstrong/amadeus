Luka: "Please be my b...end"
UNSPOKEN: No good, I still can’t hear her.
Rintaro: "Speak up. I’ll do anything I can."
Luka: "Boy...end..."
Rintaro: "What?"
Luka: "P-please be my boyfriend!"
UNSPOKEN: ......... What? B o y f r i e n d. It takes me a while to process the word. Meanwhile, Lukako starts squirming and fidgeting. She refuses to look me in the eye. My heart is pounding. What’s going on? What did she say to me? B o y f r i e n d. Boy friend. Boyfriend. She wants me to be her boyfriend until tomorrow? WHAT!?
Rintaro: "Wh-why?"
UNSPOKEN: Without thinking, I ask the worst possible question. Lukako curls up even smaller.
Luka: "I... ...like you."
UNSPOKEN: Her voice is as small as the buzzing of a mosquito, but it has all the courage she can muster. I feel my heart tighten at those words. Silence. More silence. W-wait just a second. This is too sudden. I mean, maybe it’s not sudden, exactly. I’ve known about Lukako’s feelings since yesterday, when Kurisu told me about the romance flag. But still, I didn’t think it would come to this. My mind goes blank. I can’t think straight. Lukako hangs her head, waiting for my answer. She looks so cute and innocent. I feel myself drawn to-- NO! NO NO NO! That’s wrong! That’s just wrong! I am NOT attracted to Lukako!
Rintaro: "L-let me think about it! Give me two -- no, five minutes!"
UNSPOKEN: I turn and flee like a scared rabbit. I’m so embarrassed, I can’t look back. Ten minutes later, I get back to the lab. Mayuri’s eating a red bean bun.
Mayuri: "Okarin! How’d it go? Did you apologize to Luka-chan?"
Rintaro: "Uh, yeah. So put the Juicy Chicken Number One in the microwave and nuke it so that the D-Mail’s basically ABC and..."
Mayuri: "Huwha?"
Rintaro: "The microwave was developed by knights of the Rosicrucian Order who used alchemy. Meaning that the sound of the chime is the brainwashing device, while the chime itself actually doesn’t have any meaning at all..."
Mayuri: "Waaah, Okarin’s broken!"
UNSPOKEN: I mutter incoherently as I set up the Time Leap Machine.
Mayuri: "What are you doing?"
Rintaro: "M-making a tactical retreat."
Mayuri: "Retreat...?"
UNSPOKEN: How far do I go? As far as I can. Yeah, that’s it. Far. Far away from here. I jump all the way back to August 11th, the limit of the Time Leap Machine’s range. When I’m done, Kurisu is standing before me, fiddling with the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s wiring.
Kurisu: "Stop staring. You’re distracting me. How many times do I have to tell you?"
