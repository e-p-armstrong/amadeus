Rintaro: M-morning.
Luka: Um... where are we going today?
Rintaro: Before that...
Luka: Yes?
UNSPOKEN: I make up my mind and throw out the question.
Rintaro: Do you have any memories of when you were a guy?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako twitches for a moment. And then she hangs her head.
Luka: N-no, I don't...
Rintaro: Really?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako just nods stiffly. I consider a more forceful approach, but the words of that dating manual blaze inside my head. Whatever you do, don't make the girl sad! You might get dumped! If I get dumped, then what will happen to our 4-day agreement? Lukako might refuse to turn back into a guy. ...No, Lukako's not like that. Mayuri's life hangs in the balance, so I'm sure no matter what I say, she'll turn back. Or is it naive of me to think that? Either way... Even though I'm doing this to save Mayuri, I can't just trample on Lukako's pure maidenly heart. Neither one of us speaks. Mutual distrust? Suspicion? Discomfort? One word could shatter our temporary relationship. Luka is the first to break the suffocating silence.
Luka: ...I'm sorry. Let's cancel... today's date...
