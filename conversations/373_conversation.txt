UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Lukako starts sobbing. She covers her mouth with both hands, but can't stop the tears pouring from her eyes.
Rintaro: Lukako...
UNSPOKEN: When I approach her, Lukako pulls back.
Luka: Uugh... ugg... sniff...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako wipes the corners of her eyes, but the tears keep flowing, forming a glistening line down each cheek. I'm speechless. I have no idea what to do. A girl is crying before my eyes. It's my duty as a man to comfort her. I know that, and yet no words come. I just stand there, like a useless statue. The cause of Lukako's tears is undoubtedly me. I didn't treat her right as my girlfriend, even if it was only a temporary arrangement. And now it ends with me watching as Lukako cries. Lukako... I'm the one who did this to her. I'm the cause of her grief. And yet...
Luka: Thank you... very much...
UNSPOKEN: She thanks me and bows her head.
Rintaro: Eh...?
UNSPOKEN: She lifts her head and smiles shyly through her tears.
Luka: I was... really happy... sniff... That we could be... together...
UNSPOKEN: That's a lie.
Luka: I'm glad... I fell in love... with you...
UNSPOKEN: That has to be a lie. To my surprise, Lukako takes my hand in hers. Her hand is very warm and delicate. This is the first time I've touched her since we became a couple. And... it will be the last. Lukako places a note in my hand. And then, she pulls away. She bows her head again.
Luka: ...Bye now.
UNSPOKEN: Lukako turns her back to me, then disappears into the shrine office. I look at the note. There's a number written there. Probably her mother's pager number. She kept her promise. But I... I didn't keep mine. I can't let it end like this. I run full speed back to the lab. Ignoring Kurisu's calls to stop, I slap on the headgear and leap to the past. I regain consciousness in front of Akihabara Station. Lukako is next to me. We're about to board the train for ComiMa. Lukako looks a little anxious, but she doesn't raise a single complaint. The shuttle bus pulls up. The huge line of people begins to move. We can't go to ComiMa like this. Shaking off my time leap-induced vertigo, I take Lukako by the hand.
Luka: Um...?
Rintaro: Come on!
UNSPOKEN: Once we get out of the line, I let go of Lukako's hand and start walking.
Luka: O-Okabe-san? Um, the bus is here...
Rintaro: We're not going to ComiMa.
Luka: Eh...?
Rintaro: This time... we're doing things my way!
Luka: Okabe-san... um, where are we going? Okabe...san?
