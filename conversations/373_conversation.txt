Rintaro: "I’m going to Yanabayashi Shrine. Come with me. It’s time for Operation Christina II."
Luka: "Until... the 15th... We can stop... before Mayuri-chan is in danger... ...so... Please be my... Please be my b...end... Boy...end... P-please be my boyfriend!"
UNSPOKEN: Same as before. Only this time, I have to be her boyfriend for four days instead of just two. I guess you could say it’s a bold proposal. Fortunately, I came prepared. It’s time to set Operation Christina II into motion. Last time, things got complicated when I added that experiment-loving girl to the conversation. This time, I had her watch things from the shadows near the staircase.
Rintaro: "E-excuse me. I need a moment."
UNSPOKEN: I turn my back to Lukako and call Kurisu.
Kurisu: "Sup, you filthy normal?"
Rintaro: "Who’s a normal? Think about how I feel for once. Did you hear what Lukako said just now?"
Kurisu: "No. Fill me in."
Rintaro: "You weren’t listening!?"
Kurisu: "How am I supposed to listen from all the way over here?"
Rintaro: "She confessed. Until the 15th. Then back to manhood."
Kurisu: "Roger. And? Why are you asking me? Just grant Urushibara-san’s wish."
Rintaro: "B-but it’s Lukako!"
Kurisu: "What’s wrong with her? I mean, look how cute she is."
Rintaro: "But she’s a--"
Kurisu: "Her being a guy might just be your imagination. From my perspective, she’s always been a girl."
Rintaro: "Gh..."
Kurisu: "Just give up. Bye."
Rintaro: "Ah, wai--"
UNSPOKEN: She hung up.
Rintaro: "Damn! Why did I even bring her along?"
UNSPOKEN: What a useless assistant! I stuff my phone into my pocket and head back to Lukako.
Luka: "Um... were you on the phone... with Makise-san?"
Rintaro: "Hm? Oh, yeah..."
Luka: "Oh... You looked like you were having fun..."
Rintaro: "N-nonsense."
UNSPOKEN: Is this pressure? Is she applying psychological pressure!?
Luka: "So..."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako fidgets restlessly.
Luka: "Your... answer..."
