Kurisu: "You made this choice to save Mayuri. So I’ll change my way of thinking too. Anyway, do you have any plans for your date tomorrow?"
UNSPOKEN: Date plans. I told Lukako I’d come up with something by tomorrow. So far, I’ve made no progress. I can’t help but feel uneasy about the whole thing, even though I’m doing it to save Mayuri.
Kurisu: "Well, do you?"
UNSPOKEN: T-this calls for Hououin Kyouma...
Rintaro: "...I have only one thing to say, assistant mine. I am the great Hououin Kyouma, a mad scientist with an IQ rivaling that of Isaac Newton himself!"
Kurisu: "And?"
Rintaro: "Naturally, as a mad scientist, I have no interest in this thing mortals call love. My incredible brain is devoted to the destruction of the System that controls the world, and the birth of a new age of chaos!"
Kurisu: "You’re obviously a virgin, thank you ver-- ...Hah!? ...P-pretend you didn’t just hear that."
Rintaro: "Damn you, assistant! How dare you point out the truth so bluntly! I won’t forget this insult!"
Kurisu: "S-sorry..."
Rintaro: "And what about you!? Your experience must be vast indeed if you think you can lecture me about it!"
Kurisu: "Ugh..."
UNSPOKEN: I don’t miss Christina’s grimace.
Rintaro: "That’s what I thought! You spend all your time on research, so you’ve got zero experience, don’t you!? You must’ve been awfully lonely in America, huh!?"
Kurisu: "Shut up! What’s wrong with being a virgin!? ...Hah!? Ah... awhawha..."
Rintaro: "The genius girl who cried ’virgin’ at the center of Akiba..."
UNSPOKEN: I wouldn’t be surprised to see it plastered across the blogosphere. Thankfully, it’s early morning, but there are still a few pedestrians grinning at Kurisu.
Kurisu: "L-let’s get out of here!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu starts to hurry away.
Kurisu: "What’s important for a first date is to make a good impression. An unclean appearance is out of the question. A haircut is especially important. Long hair looks dirty, so it’s no good. For clothes, you should wear something exactly the right size. Though it may be trendy, especially in Akiba, for young men to wear baggy clothes, it looks sloppy, so it’s not good."
UNSPOKEN: ...Why exactly am I in a maid cafe, getting date advice from my younger assistant (who is also a girl)?
Kurisu: "On the first date, conversation tends to break due to mutual nervousness. What’s important is to play ’conversation catch’. One-sided conversations aren’t fun for the other side. Girls especially like to talk, so the guy should try to keep the conversation going. Not just by listening. Throwing in appropriate responses is also necessary. Responsiveness gives the girl the impression that you’re really listening to her. Basically, you need to be the opposite of yourself. Anyway, focus on acting normal for now. No more of that idiotic laughter. You’re too heavy-handed with girls. You talk too pompously. You fire off nonsensical delusions."
