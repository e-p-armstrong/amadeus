Rintaro: No need for humility. Today, you mastered one of the Seishin Zanma style's secrets, Type Thirty-Two Cherry Bomb. But don't get cocky, for you are still weak.
Luka: Yes sir. I want to learn even more from you.
UNSPOKEN: The breeze feels nice after the sweat we worked up. We savor our comfortable fatigue as we drink the barley tea Lukako's mother brought for us.
Luka: I feel like it's been a long time since you last taught me, Kyouma-san.
Rintaro: For the past few days, my mind has been under the dread influence of the foul grimoire known as The Manual. But I've fully recovered. Do not worry.
Luka: ...Thank goodness. You're back to your old self.
UNSPOKEN: Lukako answers happily. And then her expression turns serious, as if she's made up her mind about something.
Luka: Um... Yesterday, you asked me if I had any memories from when I was a guy.
Rintaro: Oh, yeah...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako looks away. I see her hands fidgeting in her lap. Finally, with trembling lips, she speaks.
Luka: I... do remember.
UNSPOKEN: No surprise. I expected she'd remember after what I experienced with Faris.
Luka: I remember, or actually... umm, how should I say it... It's a very... transient feeling.
Rintaro: Transient...
Luka: I can't clearly remember it, but at the bottom of my sea of memories, well... in my head, umm...
UNSPOKEN: Then Lukako starts pawing at the air above and to the right of her head.
Luka: It feels like it's around here somewhere...
UNSPOKEN: I don't really get it.
Rintaro: Anyway, you remember?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako nods.
Luka: I'm sorry I lied yesterday...
Rintaro: Muhahaha! Don't worry about it. You should be proud to have fooled the great Hououin Kyouma!
Luka: So because I remembered, I knew Mom's pager number without having to ask.
UNSPOKEN: She takes out a piece of paper, upon which is written the number.
Luka: I was going to give you this no matter how things turned out today. And... one more thing.
UNSPOKEN: One more thing?
Luka: I don't know if it's related to my memories, but... It's about that old computer.
Rintaro: ...!?
UNSPOKEN: Now that, I didn't expect.
Rintaro: The IBN 5100!?
Luka: Yes... I think so...
UNSPOKEN: True, Lukako did seem like she knew something about the IBN 5100. Plus, Luka's dad confirmed that it was here at the shrine. And then one day, it suddenly disappeared. Does Lukako know where it is now?
Rintaro: If that's true, Lukako, then you might not have to turn back into a guy.
UNSPOKEN: But Lukako faintly shakes her head.
Luka: I don't think it's that easy...
Rintaro: But why not?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako grips my hand.
Luka: Please come with me. I'll show you.
