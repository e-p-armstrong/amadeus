UNSPOKEN: Since neither of us knows anything about romance, we’re studying out of a dating manual we bought on the way here.
Kurisu: "Who are you calling an American virgin?"
Rintaro: "Who else but you?"
Kurisu: "Yeah, sure thing, virgin. There’s a saying. ’A fortress is judged by how many attacks it repulses; a soldier is judged by how many fortresses he takes.’"
Rintaro: "That’s not a saying. Don’t look so proud of yourself."
Kurisu: "...You’re right. This is a dumb argument. Anyway, this dating manual actually says some pretty interesting things."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu flips through the manual on top of the table.
Kurisu: "Like ’when walking down the street, be sure to put yourself between your date and the road’ or ’whatever you do, don’t make the girl pay for anything’. Okay! For your date tomorrow, make sure you follow all of these rules."
UNSPOKEN: I wonder if I can really be that careful...
Kurisu: "And after that, there’s... carry a clean handkerchief. Spread it out when the girl goes to sit on a park bench."
Rintaro: "I’m not her butler."
Kurisu: "But that’s what the book says. When it’s time to eat, avoid fast food of all kinds. Family restaurants are borderline acceptable. Anything else depends on your budget."
Rintaro: "Family restaurants are borderline..."
UNSPOKEN: Where are the family restaurants in Akiba?
Kurisu: "Arrive at the meeting place at least 15 minutes early. Tardiness is unacceptable."
Rintaro: "15 minutes early..."
Kurisu: "Then you just need to decide where to take her. Movies, art galleries, strolling through town, and food are all safe."
Rintaro: "I see. It’s easier than I thought. I was under the impression that a first date required going to a beautiful beach resort, exchanging your first kiss bathed in the light of the setting sun, and stuff like that."
Kurisu: "Ah, that’s really romantic! ...I mean, that’s virgin imagination at full throttle. You’ve read too much manga."
Rintaro: "You too."
Kurisu: "Besides, your date’s a minor, so don’t even think about bringing her to a hotel, okay?"
Rintaro: "...What do you take me for?"
UNSPOKEN: That way lie... forbidden lusts. Not to mention, Lukako’s such an innocent girl. If I brought her to a hotel, she’d probably faint from shock.
Kurisu: "That just about covers it. Well? Was my lecture helpful?"
Rintaro: "You mean the manual’s lecture."
UNSPOKEN: Anyway... strolling around town counts as a date, huh? In that case, I don’t have to waste money.
Faris: "Nyanya? Kyouma, are you going on a date, nya?"
UNSPOKEN: Faris comes to our table carrying drinks.
Faris: "Thanks for waiting! I’ll prepare your iced coffee, nyan♪"
UNSPOKEN: As usual, she pours in milk and syrup right in front of me. Kurisu watches this with great interest. I guess this is her first time at a maid cafe.
Faris: "Is Mayushii the lucky girl, nya?"
