Faris: "Hmmya? Not her, nya? Then..."
UNSPOKEN: Faris looks at Kurisu.
Faris: "Is it her, nya?"
Kurisu: "Hwehh...!"
Rintaro: "No, she’s my assistant."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu and I exchange glares sharper than a sword’s blade. I swear sparks are flying.
Faris: "Then some other girl, nya? Kyouma, you tomcat, you’re making moves on too many girls, nya."
Kurisu: "Oh-ho... So you’re making moves on too many girls, huh?"
Rintaro: "What nonsense."
UNSPOKEN: Well... I guess I did hug Faris. But that was on the 14th, so when I time leaped to the 12th, it was undone... I shake off a pang of loneliness and return to the conversation. The next day finds me strolling around Akiba with Lukako.
Luka: "So... where to next?"
UNSPOKEN: Event #1, lunch at a family restaurant, is already complete. I took care of the bill, and now we’re back out in the heat. I’ve got the entire day planned out in my head. The next event is...
Rintaro: "How about we take a walk around town?"
Luka: "Eh? Um, okay."
UNSPOKEN: It’s Obon holiday, so Akiba is crowded. To avoid the crowds, we end up walking through the back streets. My plan is to walk with Lukako all the way to Ueno and back. That should be enough, right? I walk quickly. This conversation thing isn’t going so well. I tried to follow the guide’s advice and be a good listener, but Lukako’s silent by nature. She doesn’t really start talking on her own. Even at the family restaurant, the words we exchanged were mostly just things like It’s crowded today, It’s delicious, and It was delicious. And I think it was a mistake to just wander around. Especially since we’ve ended up in a residential area with no interesting scenery whatsoever.
Luka: "Um... Okabe-san."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako speaks up. She’s a few steps behind me.
Rintaro: "Yeah?"
UNSPOKEN: I stop and turn around. Lukako catches up, and we start walking together again.
Luka: "...Do you remember? About the first time you and I met."
Rintaro: "...Yeah."
UNSPOKEN: Of course, what I actually remember is how I met the male Lukako. It was during Golden Week in May. I was searching Akiba for materials to build a new Future Gadget when I saw Lukako in his miko garb, surrounded by some cameramen.
Luka: "P-please stop... I can’t..."
Low-Angler A: "P-please, let me take just one photo."
Low-Angler B: "That cosplay is super moe. I’ve never seen such a cute miko cosplayer before."
Luka: "Th-this isn’t cosplay..."
