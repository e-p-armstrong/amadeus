Rintaro: Strange how?
Luka: Inside my mind, there are two memories about that old computer mixed together... The first is the memory of me breaking it. The other has no memory of it at all... The male me didn't break the computer. He swept the main shrine instead of the storehouse...
UNSPOKEN: So Lukako swept the storehouse because she became a girl. Because she swept the storehouse, she broke the IBN 5100, and deposited it into this coin locker. As a result, the IBN 5100 will never reach me. Is this the Butterfly Effect?
Luka: So there's no choice... I have to go back to being a guy.
UNSPOKEN: There's no longer any doubt in her eyes. There's no choice. She knows it as well as I. We return empty-handed to Yanabayashi Shrine, which is dyed scarlet by the setting sun. Lukako lets go of my hand after we arrive. We spent the whole walk hand-in-hand. Then she turns to me.
Luka: So this is goodbye...
Rintaro: Yeah.
Luka: I'm really happy... that I could train with you again.
UNSPOKEN: She smiles shyly again. But her cheeks are dyed pink. I can tell she's desperately holding back her tears. But those tears hold a different meaning than the ones I saw before I time leaped. At least, I'd like to think so.
Rintaro: I didn't really do anything... boyfriend-like for you, did I?
Luka: That doesn't matter.
Rintaro: Yeah, you're right.
UNSPOKEN: I'm sincerely relieved. Because Lukako smiled for me.
Luka: ...Please, save Mayuri-chan. Mayuri-chan is... really important to me.
Rintaro: Lukako...
Luka: Ahaha... um, please, go already. If you don't... I might cry... So, please... Thank you... for everything. Ah, this is when I use that phrase, right? Umm, El Psy Kongalee...
Rintaro: It's Kongroo.
UNSPOKEN: I find myself smiling. Lukako forces a smile too.
Luka: El Psy Kongroo.
UNSPOKEN: She bows deeply. She doesn't raise her head. A sign for me to go already. I turn back to the archway at the shrine's entrance. My feet are heavy. They won't advance. I stop in front of the stairs. Then I take out my phone.
Kurisu: Okabe? Mayuri called. She was mad. You stood her up on your promise to go to ComiMa.
Rintaro: Christina. I need you to enter a number into the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Kurisu: What? Explain yourself.
Rintaro: Please, just do it... I'm sending a D-Mail.
UNSPOKEN: I hear a sigh on the other end of the phone.
Rintaro: The number is...
