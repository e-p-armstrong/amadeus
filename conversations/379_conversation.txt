UNSPOKEN: Mayuri can't be saved. Mayuri's death... is fate. No matter how many worldlines I cross, convergence will occur. Mayuri will die... no matter what. I'm tired of it all. Mayuri. I'm sorry. My ego wasn't strong enough to sacrifice everything for your sake. The warmth of Lukako's hand slips away as the vertigo hits me. I'm still at the shrine, but I no longer feel Lukako clinging to my back. I turn around slowly.
Luka: ...?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako is standing a short distance away, as if to see me off. No tears. Just a bewildered smile. My chest feels like it's about to burst. I hold it back.
Rintaro: Hey, Lukako.
Luka: Yes?
Rintaro: You're...
UNSPOKEN: I hesitate for a moment, but I have to know.
Rintaro: You're a guy, right?
Luka: Um... yes?
UNSPOKEN: She is gone. He has returned. Cuter than any girl. Looks good in miko robes. But he's a guy. I bite my lip.
Rintaro: Do you... like me?
Luka: W-what? I... don't understand.
Rintaro: ...Do you like me?
Luka: Um... I respect you!
UNSPOKEN: He respects me? I don't deserve his respect. But that's not what matters now. Lukako's answer seemed clear, but wasn't. He didn't answer the question.
Luka: If I change back into a guy... I'll have to hide my feelings for you!
UNSPOKEN: Lukako might still like me, even though he's a guy again. However, he'll never speak honestly about those feelings. This is what Lukako decided for himself. It would be wrong to pry any further. Maybe I'm just running away. Maybe I should pry, force him to confront his feelings. But I'm not strong enough to accept the consequences. I'll just end up hurting Lukako.
Rintaro: Thanks. You are my disciple, now and forever. Agreed?
Luka: Y-yes! Of course I am.
UNSPOKEN: I look away, unable to bear his shy smile. The worldline has changed. Lukako is a guy again. Which means the IBN 5100 should be here at the shrine. On the previous worldline, girl Lukako broke the IBN 5100 while cleaning the storehouse. But guy Lukako didn't clean the storehouse. He never broke the IBN 5100. It's 6:46 PM. Judging by past experience, it is very likely that I've averted Mayuri's death for today. But just in case, I should get back to the lab within the hour.
Rintaro: Lukako, do you remember breaking an old computer in the shrine storehouse last year?
Luka: An old computer? No, I don't remember anything like that. I don't really understand computers. I haven't played with them much.
