Itaru: "Geh!? Okarin, you idiot, those words are an insult to virgins the world over! Apologize! Apologize to the virgins!"
Rintaro: "Just think about it. All you do is walk, eat, and go home. And the whole time, you have to worry about what your partner is thinking. What’s fun about that?"
Mayuri: "Don’t say that, Okarin. You’ll make Luka-chan sad."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri’s expression is uncharacteristically serious.
Mayuri: "You know... just being with the person she likes is enough to make a girl happy. That’s all she really needs. Doesn’t being together make boys happy too? If not... that makes Mayuri sad."
UNSPOKEN: Why would that make Mayuri sad?
Itaru: "Okarin’s the minority. I mean, dates are a great opportunity for H-scenes."
Rintaro: "You’re an idiot."
Itaru: "Come on! Holding hands and stuff’s pretty H, isn’t it? And when you’re arm-in-arm and her boob hits your elbow, that’s like super mega H! And then at the end of the date, you kiss, right!? Damn you! Death to normals!"
Rintaro: "You play too much eroge."
Mayuri: "Hey, hey. When did Luka-chan fall for Okarin?"
Rintaro: "When? Well..."
Luka: "I was really surprised when you said it didn’t matter... but at the same time... it really made me happy. Ever since you said those words... I’ve liked you."
UNSPOKEN: I think back on what she said. Something still feels off about her story. I said that Luka’s gender didn’t matter. I remember that clearly. But didn’t I say that because Lukako was a guy?
Rintaro: "...Right. That doesn’t make sense."
UNSPOKEN: Now I know what feels out of place. I wouldn’t have said that to a female Lukako. So why does this Lukako remember what I said back then? I recall what happened with Faris.
Faris: "...I remember, nya! The wish Faris made... ...Was to save Papa, who died ten years ago, nya."
UNSPOKEN: Faris regained her memories from before she sent the D-Mail. Could Lukako, too, have remembered the previous worldline, where she was a guy? That would explain everything. However... She remembers that event, and she said she liked me for it, so... Did Lukako like me even when she was a guy? I think I need to check this out. The next morning, I head to the shrine to meet with Lukako. She’s already waiting in the courtyard. When she sees me, she smiles and waves her hand. Too cute... must... resist...
Luka: "Good morning."
Rintaro: "M-morning."
Luka: "Um... where are we going today?"
Rintaro: "Before that..."
Luka: "Yes?"
UNSPOKEN: I make up my mind and throw out the question.
Rintaro: "Do you have any memories of when you were a guy?"
UNSPOKEN: Lukako twitches for a moment. And then she hangs her head.
Luka: "N-no, I don’t..."
Rintaro: "Really?"
