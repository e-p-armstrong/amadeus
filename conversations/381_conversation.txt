UNSPOKEN: Lukako bows her head and goes back into the shrine office. I hurt her. I feel guilty, but at the same time, relieved. I hate myself for it. Instead of returning to the lab, I stand on the bridge in front of the station and gaze blankly at the stream of people. Faris might be visiting the lab. Faris was at the lab on this day when I first came to this worldline. My actions shouldn’t have influenced Mayuri’s, so she should have called Faris over to show her the costumes. Right now, I don’t want to see anybody. I need to think. But try as I might, no ideas come. No solutions. Lukako agreed to go back to being a guy if I went out with her for a time. I’ve stayed faithful to that, so... Faithful? How? I just made a huge mistake back there! I’ve done nothing but make Lukako sad. Tomorrow... Tomorrow is the 15th. The day ComiMa opens. The day Mayuri dies. At the very least, I need to make our relationship last until that evening. Tomorrow is the end. But I’m not confident I can show Lukako a fun time. Alright. So instead of fussing over a date, I’ll just try something that won’t make Lukako sad. The next morning, after Mayuri and Daru have left for Ariake, I head to the shrine to pick up Lukako. We hop the train at Akiba station. When she looks askance at me, I tell her we’re going to see Mayuri. Today it won’t just be the two of us. I don’t know what to say when we’re alone. I’m afraid I’ll just hurt her again. It’s time to try something different. When we get off the train at Tokyo Big Sight, Lukako stares in wonder at the scene spread before her. People, people, people. People as far as the eye can see. Welcome to ComiMa, the otaku festival. It’s the first day, so Big Sight’s more crowded than usual. This is my plan: to take Lukako to ComiMa. I’m not making her cosplay, of course. Lukako wouldn’t even do it at Mayuri’s request, and I don’t want to force her to do anything she doesn’t want to. We’re just here to look and have fun. The first order of business is to hook up with Mayuri and Daru. Those two live and breathe ComiMa, so I’m sure they’ll have a lot to talk about. Conversation will flow, and I’ll be off the hook. How wonderful to have friends you can count on! Of course, bringing a date to ComiMa is a surefire way to earn myself the hatred of otaku everywhere, but no matter. I’ll endure their contempt if that’s what it takes to make Lukako happy. So resolved, I strike out through the crowd towards our designated rendezvous point. Lukako, clearly overwhelmed by the sheer number of people, struggles to follow behind.
Mayuri: "Tutturu♪ Okarin! Luka-chan!"
UNSPOKEN: Near the edge of the parking lot, I see the petite Mayuri wave her hands high. There aren’t as many people here.
Mayuri: "Welcome to ComiMa, Luka-chan."
Luka: "Y-yeah. It’s my first time coming here, but it’s amazing..."
Mayuri: "Take it easy!"
Rintaro: "Where’s Daru?"
