Kurisu: Is there more tomorrow?
Mayuri: Yeah, and the day after, too.
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri just got back from ComiMa 30 minutes ago. She and Kurisu, who stayed behind at the lab, have just finished eating cup noodles. It's already past 8, and so far, nothing has happened. Mayuri is still alive. Going by the pattern, her death has probably been postponed until about this time tomorrow. Is this the will of some higher being? God, fate, the universe itself? Or is it merely coincidence? That doesn't matter now.
Mayuri: Okeydokey! Mayushii's got an early day tomorrow, so I'm going home.
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri takes a big stretch and starts getting ready to go home. She's been up since five this morning. Looks like she plans to wake up early tomorrow, too. That reminds me. I haven't seen Daru at all. He's fighting in the ComiMa Holy War too, so that doesn't surprise me. Busy checking his spoils, I guess.
Mayuri: Hey guys, why don't you come too?
Rintaro: I'll pass, but my assistant looks like she wants to go.
Kurisu: What!?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu jumps up at my answer.
Kurisu: Hey! Don't put words in my mouth!
Rintaro: I saw your eyes sparkling while you listened to Mayuri's cosplay stories.
Kurisu: Maybe, but nobody said anything about going.
Mayuri: Come on, Chris-chan!
UNSPOKEN: I know that Kurisu is an @channeler, but is she an otaku? Not all @channelers are otaku, but she has often hinted at an interest in cosplay.
Kurisu: No way. I'd suffocate in a crowd like that.
Mayuri: It's not as crowded on day two! If you're worried, come in the afternoon. All the popular stuff will be sold out, though.
Kurisu: You go, Okabe. You're Mayuri's guardian, aren't you?
Mayuri: No, Mayushii is Okarin's hostage!
Kurisu: Oh, right. That's what it was. Well you don't want your hostage to escape, do you? Shouldn't you take her along in handcuffs or something?
Rintaro: I've got business in Akiba.
Kurisu: What do you mean, business?
UNSPOKEN: The search for Kiryu Moeka. I already sent her an email -- We need to talk. -- and now I'm awaiting her reply. Something tells me it's not going to work.
Kurisu: No answer? I guess it was just an excuse.
Rintaro: Christina. We need to talk.
Kurisu: Again? Abrupt as usual.
Rintaro: Hm? What do you mean, again?
Kurisu: Nothing.
Mayuri: Whatcha gonna talk about? You two have been really close lately, huh? You're always talking together. Mayushii really wants to join in your secret meetings and stuff.
Rintaro: Don't worry. We've been talking about the Time Leap Machine. It would just be gibberish to you.
UNSPOKEN: Not entirely accurate, but not a lie either.
Rintaro: Besides, the purpose of this particular discussion is to convince Christina to attend ComiMa. Prepare for good news, Mayuri! Muhahaha!
Mayuri: Oh, great! Thanks, Okarin.
