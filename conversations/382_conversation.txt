UNSPOKEN: Damn. That means he won’t join up with us for at least another hour.  Couldn’t he forgo the battle just this once? Lukako’s eyes dart from place to place. She’s clearly uncomfortable in the chaotic atmosphere. There’s still some awkwardness between us after what happened yesterday. Even on the train ride, we barely spoke to each other. What’s the point in being a couple if it turns out like this? It was easier to talk when we weren’t supposed to be boyfriend and girlfriend. Lukako seemed to enjoy herself more too. Was it a mistake to bring her to ComiMa? Well, Lukako didn’t refuse. Even when I told her we were going to ComiMa, she just nodded obediently.
Mayuri: "Mayushii will show you around, okay? Um, there’s lots of people, so we’ve gotta be careful. First we’ll go to the cosplay area! And then we’ll go inside!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri’s more cheerful than usual. She must be happy to have us here.
Mayuri: "Hey, is there anything you guys wanna see?"
Rintaro: "...Lukako, is there anything you want to see?"
Luka: "Ah, no..."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako shakes her head.
Luka: "It’s my first time, so... if Okabe-san wants to see something, I’ll go see it..."
Rintaro: "I’m not particularly interested in anything."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako looks unhappy. Crap, I shouldn’t have answered like that.
Mayuri: "Hey, Luka-chan. If you come to the cosplay area, I’m sure you’ll change your mind about cosplaying!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri talks happily to Lukako. I’m glad I chose to rely on this ditz who can’t read the mood.
Mayuri: "It’s not embarrassing at all, see? ’Cause everyone’s having fun! Kaede-chan and Fubuki-chan are there wearing Mayushii’s costumes! I’ll introduce you, okay? You should come tomorrow too! I’ll bring costumes for you and we can cosplay together! I think Okarin would be perfect as Zerosum from Code Jeass. You’ll cosplay if Okarin does it with you, right, Luka-chan? You will, won’t you? Mayushii thinks it’s a great idea!"
Rintaro: "Not a chance."
Luka: "S-sorry..."
Mayuri: "Eh? No way..."
