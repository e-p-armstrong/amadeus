Rintaro: So, Christina.
Kurisu: I'm not going to ComiMa.
Rintaro: You said 'again' just now. We've talked like this before, just the two of us?
Kurisu: Losing your memory now? Does our little mad scientist have an acetylcholine deficiency?
Rintaro: I'm being serious.
Kurisu: You're acting weird today. What's going on?
Rintaro: Please. I need to know.
Kurisu: I mean, yeah. This is like the fifth time you've brought me outside to talk about the Time Leap Machine.
Rintaro: Have we talked about my time leaping?
UNSPOKEN: For an instant, Kurisu opens her eyes wide in surprise. But then, she gives me an angry glare.
Kurisu: You're time leaping?
UNSPOKEN: I nod.
Rintaro: More than a dozen times already.
Kurisu: That many!? What the hell are you doing!?
UNSPOKEN: Hmm... Looks like she doesn't know anything about Lukako or my shifting between worldlines. But that's only natural. So far, I've changed worldlines a total of three times. Let's call the first worldline where Mayuri died Alpha 1. The worldline where Faris and I fought the Viral Attackers is Alpha 2. The worldline where I dated girl Lukako is Alpha 3. And now I'm on Alpha 4. From my perspective, Alpha 1, Alpha 2, and Alpha 3 were undone by my D-Mails. But for Kurisu and everyone else on Alpha 4, those worldlines were nothing but separate, intangible possibilities to begin with. I guess I have to explain everything again. I sigh heavily, then begin.
Kurisu: ...I think I get it.
UNSPOKEN: After I'm done, Kurisu sighs and lightly pats my arm.
Kurisu: Don't wear yourself out.
Rintaro: It's a disgrace to be comforted by my assistant.
Kurisu: Why are you always like that!? I'm even trying to be nice. You're really full of yourself, you know?
Rintaro: I don't need your sympathy. Everything that happened is my fault. I'm just getting what I deserve. ...Come to think of it, every time I explain this to you, I always end up hating myself in the end.
Kurisu: Okabe...
Rintaro: Don't worry about me. Worry about Mayuri. Mayuri will probably die tomorrow. I don't know how it will happen.
UNSPOKEN: If Mayuri stays away from the lab, she can probably avoid running into Moeka and her men. It doesn't matter, though. She'll die all the same. All Alpha worldlines converge on her death. Escaping the attractor field is the only way to save her.
Rintaro: Sorry about this, but I want you to be there when she dies tomorrow night.
Kurisu: That's why you want me to go to ComiMa?
Rintaro: There's nothing we can do to prevent her death. Just stay close and tell me when it happens. Once I know, I'll make the time leap.
Kurisu: I can't believe there's nothing we can do. It just doesn't feel real. But it's the truth, isn't it? I can see it in your eyes. ...Are you okay?
Rintaro: No. I still haven't saved Mayu--
