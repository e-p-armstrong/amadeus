UNSPOKEN: Her lips tremble. Her voice trembles. I summon my resolve and answer her with a laugh.
Rintaro: "Heh! What are you talking about?"
Luka: "Eh...?"
Rintaro: "Our couple phase isn’t over yet!"
UNSPOKEN: I strike a pose and mimic a line from a popular card-battling anime. Until I witnessed Mayuri’s death, this was how I acted all the time. Now it takes some effort, but I still have it in me.
Luka: "B-but..."
Rintaro: "Weren’t you listening? This time, we’re doing things my way. Now, my disciple! Bring forth the demon sword, Samidare!"
UNSPOKEN: The wind blows. The tree growing over the main building rustles its leaves in response. Lukako looks at me blankly. Tears form in the corners of her eyes.
Luka: "Wh... what?"
Rintaro: "Isn’t it obvious? It’s time to continue your training in the Seishin Zanma school of swordsmanship!"
Luka: "My training..."
Rintaro: "Have you already forgotten what I taught you?"
Luka: "N-no... but, Oka--"
Rintaro: "It’s Kyouma."
Luka: "...Eh?"
Rintaro: "Have you forgotten my true name, Lukako? I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!"
UNSPOKEN: Swallowing my embarrassment, I strike another pose.
Rintaro: "I was so caught up in the question of your gender that I lost sight of our true relationship. But now I’ve finally realized the truth. Our relationship was decided from the very beginning."
Luka: "Decided... how?"
Rintaro: "I may be a man and you may be a woman, but our temporary relationship as a couple..."
UNSPOKEN: I take a deep breath. I gently comb my fingers through Lukako’s hair. I twist my lips into a grin.
Rintaro: "Matters not!"
Luka: "Ah..."
Rintaro: "I am I. Lukako is Lukako. And Lukako is my disciple."
UNSPOKEN: As I gently stroke her hair, Lukako puts her warm hand on top of mine. The tears collected in the corners of her eyes suddenly fall.
Luka: "Y-yes... of course. Okabe... I mean, Kyouma-san... is my master."
Rintaro: "Well said! Now, Lukako, bring forth Samidare."
Luka: "A-at once! Um, just a moment. I’ll be right back. Please stay here, okay?"
Rintaro: "I’m not going anywhere. So hurry."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako reluctantly lets go of my hand, shyly turns away from me, and heads to the shrine office. We spend four hours training, just like we used to. Practice swings with the demon sword. Stories of the sword’s history. Lectures on the intricacies of Seishin Zanma swordsmanship. All fabricated from my chuunibyou delusions. I talk. Lukako, dressed now in her miko robes, listens with rapt attention. Occasionally, we take a break, sit on the shrine’s stairway, and eat the sweet rice balls Lukako’s mother brings us. And that’s how we spend an extraordinarily ordinary four hours.
Rintaro: "Alright, that’s it for today."
