Luka: "Um... not there..."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako faces away from Daibiru and points. To a coin locker tucked in a narrow alley.
Luka: "It happened last year, just before New Years..."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako walks up to the coin locker as she talks.
Luka: "The computer was at our shrine until then."
UNSPOKEN: Until New Years... That’s a contradiction. It was only two weeks ago that I found the IBN 5100 at Yanabayashi Shrine. Which means I really haven’t returned to the original worldline.
Luka: "It’s all my fault. I was helping out at the shrine, sweeping the storehouse when... I broke it by accident."
Rintaro: "You... broke it?"
UNSPOKEN: Lukako nods.
Luka: "But I thought Dad would get mad at me if he found out, so... I brought it here... and hid it in the coin locker."
Rintaro: "It must have been tough bringing it all the way out here. That thing weighs a ton."
Luka: "I used a pushcart from home. It... broke too."
UNSPOKEN: Even so, it must’ve been hard to get it here with just a pushcart. Maybe she was running on adrenaline.
Luka: "When I heard Kyouma-san was searching for it, I was really surprised. I know I should’ve told you the truth, but I thought you’d hate me for it, and I couldn’t say anything."
Rintaro: "Nonsense. I wouldn’t hate you for that. No matter what, you’re still my disciple."
Luka: "I know."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako takes the locker key out of her pocket.
Luka: "It’s already been more than half a year, so the management probably took it away..."
Rintaro: "Half a year... I guess it’s hopeless, then."
UNSPOKEN: This locker charges 200 yen per day. Normally, if a coin locker goes unpaid for more than a few days, the management retrieves the contents. And if the owner doesn’t claim it within a month, it’s usually thrown away. Meaning the IBN 5100 is already... Lukako goes to a large locker at the end of the row, inserts the key, and tries the lock.
Luka: "Ah... it’s not locked..."
Rintaro: "I guess that settles it."
UNSPOKEN: Sure enough, Lukako opens the door to reveal an empty locker.
Luka: "...I’m sorry."
UNSPOKEN: Either way, it doesn’t matter. There’s no point in retrieving a broken IBN 5100. But I don’t tell her that.
Rintaro: "It’s not your fault. I’m the one who messed with the timeline. Everything that happened is my fault."
Luka: "Kyouma-san..."
