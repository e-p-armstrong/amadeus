UNSPOKEN: Her words are like needles stabbing into my heart.
Luka: "Because... because... If I change back into a guy... I’ll have to hide my feelings for you! It would be wrong for me to love you, if I’m a guy..."
UNSPOKEN: I have nothing against homosexuals. But unfortunately, I am heterosexual. I won’t be able to answer Lukako’s feelings if he’s a guy.
Luka: "My memories of today will vanish too... won’t they? That we held hands and walked together... That we trained together after such a long time... That I’m touching Okabe-san’s body right now... I don’t want to forget... I don’t! Because I love you... I love you, Okabe-san! I want to save Mayuri-chan too, and I understand there’s no other way, but... It still hurts... At the very least, I want to keep my memories of today. If I’d known it would hurt this much... Then I never would’ve wished to become a girl in the first place."
Rintaro: "Lukako..."
Luka: "Sniff... I’m sorry. I know ’that doesn’t matter’ to you, right? Sniff..."
Rintaro: "Even as a guy, you’re still Lukako to me. That won’t change."
Luka: "Yes... It makes me happy to hear you say that... Okabe-san... please send the email. Please. Send it quickly... If you let me feel your warmth any longer, I... I might say even worse things... I can’t hold back my feelings anymore!"
Rintaro: "Lukako..."
UNSPOKEN: Is this really okay?
Luka: "Okabe-san... please!"
UNSPOKEN: I’m about to sacrifice someone again. Is it my place to make that decision? My fingers tremble around my phone. But Lukako embraces those trembling fingers with her own.
Luka: "Will you... remember me?"
Rintaro: "...Yes."
UNSPOKEN: With just one call to the PhoneWave (name subject to change), I can send a message to Luka’s mother’s pager.
Luka: "Will you remember me... as a girl?"
Rintaro: "...Yes."
UNSPOKEN: If I make the call...
Luka: "Will you remember these four short days we were together?"
Rintaro: "...Yes."
UNSPOKEN: Lukako places her finger on top of mine. On top of the Send button.
Luka: "Thank you... Okabe-san. Farewell... my love..."
Rintaro: "No. I can’t do it!"
Luka: "Okabe-san... Why?"
Rintaro: "I can’t do it anymore... I can’t sacrifice anybody else’s memories!"
UNSPOKEN: I’ve already trampled on Suzuha and Faris’s memories. I turned a blind eye to their suffering, all the while telling myself it was to save Mayuri. I justified it by telling myself I would carry their burdens, but that was just a convenient excuse.
Rintaro: "I don’t have the right!"
