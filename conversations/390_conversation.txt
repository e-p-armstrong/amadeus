UNSPOKEN: I ask Lukako to fetch his father for me, so I can ask him whether or not the IBN 5100 was in the storehouse.
Luka’s Father: "An old computer... yes, I do remember. I’ll go check. Please wait a moment."
UNSPOKEN: He heads into the storeroom out back, just like on the previous worldline. But on the previous worldline, the IBN 5100 was no longer in the storehouse, since girl Lukako had secretly moved it. How will it turn out this time? Luka’s dad returns after about 10 minutes. His expression is grave. That’s all the answer I need. Nothing has changed.
Luka’s Father: "It’s gone. I couldn’t find it anywhere."
UNSPOKEN: I quickly glance at Lukako’s face. Blank. He doesn’t seem to know anything. Lukako is innocent. I’m sure of it.
Luka’s Father: "The lock to the storehouse was broken. Someone may have stolen it."
Rintaro: "Stolen it?"
UNSPOKEN: It didn’t disappear? A thief took it?
Luka’s Father: "There’s evidence someone dragged something heavy away. That wasn’t there at the end-of-the-year cleaning, and the lock wasn’t broken when I checked last month. I never expected a thief would break in."
Luka: "Then shouldn’t we report it to the police?"
UNSPOKEN: While they discuss what to do, I sigh and consider the situation.
Rintaro: "This isn’t going to work."
UNSPOKEN: The IBN 5100 is still out of reach. There are two D-Mails left to cancel. Something tells me that if I cancel just one more, I can get back the IBN 5100. But which one?
Luka: "Um, Okabe-san. I don’t really understand, but please don’t be sad. J-just go ’It matters not!’ like you always do."
UNSPOKEN: I chuckle. Lukako’s so adorable when he’s trying to cheer me up. But he’s a guy.
Rintaro: "You’re using that phrase wrong, you know."
