UNSPOKEN: Kurisu glances at Moeka again. Moeka is completely expressionless. She's lightly kicking the dirt in boredom. She hasn't used her phone once since we began the search for FB.
Kurisu: Isn't she our enemy?
Rintaro: She is an enemy, but we're cooperating in order to uncover the truth.
Kurisu: Isn't she the one who... killed Mayuri?
Rintaro: ...Yes.
UNSPOKEN: However, Moeka's just a pawn, and one that no longer poses a threat. To save Mayuri, I need to capture the king. Well, the king's cellphone.
Kurisu: Whatever. So where are you going now? Take me with you.
Rintaro: Have you gone mad, assistant mine?
Kurisu: I'm perfectly sane, and I'm not your assistant.
Rintaro: It could be dangerous.
Kurisu: Eh...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu falters for a moment, but quickly tightens her expression.
Kurisu: Do I die today?
UNSPOKEN: I've experienced the future, so I know who dies today.
Rintaro: No. You don't die.
Kurisu: Then there's no problem. This worldline has essentially guaranteed my survival.
UNSPOKEN: Right. Kurisu doesn't die today. Neither does Mayuri. The only person who dies today is... Kiryu Moeka. This afternoon, she kills herself. I've already told Moeka her fate. But in spite of that, Moeka doesn't seem upset -- at least on the surface. She's expressionless as always. The only difference is that she's not checking her phone as often. But Moeka's not a strong woman. Beneath that expressionless mask, is she struggling against the fear of death? I decide to confront Tennouji directly. I have Kurisu stand guard outside the house while Moeka and I go inside. Not that we're planning to break in. We ring the doorbell like honest citizens. Tennouji soon opens the door and invites us into the living room. The divergence meter is sitting in its usual spot. I glance at the numbers. 0. 523307%. There's still a long way to go before I reach one percent. How much more of this can I take?
Tennouji: Make yerselves at home.
UNSPOKEN: It's just after dawn, much too early for guests, but Tennouji welcomes us with a smile. He even starts preparing some instant coffee.
Rintaro: You're an early riser, Mister Braun.
Tennouji: Yeah. Gotta see my little girl off to school. I know it's summer break, but habits die hard.
Rintaro: Is your daughter still asleep?
Tennouji: Hey. You thinking of trying something while she's sleeping? Touch her and I'll break your head, got it?
Rintaro: Don't worry.
