Kurisu: "I know. That’s not what I meant."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu interrupts me.
Kurisu: "Are you okay?"
Rintaro: "I don’t follow."
Kurisu: "You’re carrying an awful burden."
UNSPOKEN: It’s rare for her to look so concerned for me.
Rintaro: "I told you not to worry about me. It’s Mayuri you need to worry about. Tomorrow, I’m going to look for Moeka."
UNSPOKEN: If Mayuri doesn’t die tomorrow, I can postpone the time leap. If Mayuri does die tomorrow, I’ll return to the past no matter what.
Rintaro: "I wish there were some way that Mayuri wouldn’t have to suffer..."
Kurisu: "Then why don’t you time leap now?"
Rintaro: "I can’t plan effectively without knowing the deadline."
Kurisu: "I don’t want to see Mayuri die either, you know."
Rintaro: "I know how you feel, but you’re the only one I can ask."
Kurisu: "Where did all this trust come from?"
Rintaro: "...You’re my assistant, after all."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu forces a laugh at my feeble attempt at a joke.
Kurisu: "You’re so full of yourself."
UNSPOKEN: We have our plan. Kurisu will go to her first ComiMa. Mayuri will be so delighted when I tell her the news. I haven’t seen Mayuri all day. I want to be with her, of course, but that’s not possible. Moeka hasn’t replied, which means I have to find her myself. Unfortunately, I don’t know anything about her. My only clue is Arc Rewrite, the company Moeka supposedly worked at. I find it after a quick search online. Sure enough, their business is producing articles for PC magazines. Luckily, their office is in Akiba. I try calling first, but it goes to voice mail. I guess they’re still closed for the Obon holiday. Or maybe it’s just a bad time? Looks like I’ve got no choice but to visit them in person. It’s the second day of ComiMa and Akiba is deserted. Most of the otaku are lined up at Big Sight right now. I’ve experienced the craze of ComiMa several times firsthand. It’s literal war. It scares me whenever Mayuri goes alone. I can’t help but imagine her trampled by a horde of crazed otaku. But in reality, Mayuri’s surprisingly quick and tough. I’ve seen her weave through crowds like you wouldn’t believe. Kurisu’s the one more likely to get trampled. I can’t help but feel sorry for her. Maybe it was wrong to ask her to go. I find the Arc Rewrite office in a fancy-looking building on the outskirts of Akiba. I take the elevator up, but there’s nobody there. I lean against the wall and wait. After about thirty minutes, a man dressed in shirt and tie appears. I explain that I’m a relative of Kiryu Moeka and ask for her contact info. But he gives an unexpected answer.
Male Staff-Member: "We don’t have an employee by that name."
Rintaro: "You... don’t?"
