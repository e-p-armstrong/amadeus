UNSPOKEN: I make several more attempts to take her phone while she babbles incoherently, but she just slaps my hand away each time. Next, I try persuasion. I promise to help her search for FB if she lends me her phone. It’s a lie, of course, though come to think of it, I would like a piece of FB, too. But that can wait until after I’ve saved Mayuri.
Moeka: "...uugh..."
UNSPOKEN: But Moeka doesn’t buy it. If, that is, she heard me at all. Dammit. We’re not getting anywhere. Maybe I should take it from her by force. But what if she tries to kill me before I can send the D-Mail? In her current state, she might not have the strength to retaliate. On the other hand, if she does retaliate, there’s not much I can do against someone with a gun. What should I do? Her gun... Where would she keep it? I quickly scan the room, but there’s no sign of it. Crap! That startled me. Could she have picked a worse time? I try again, this time asking nicely to borrow her phone. Moeka doesn’t reply. She’s staring at her phone. As she realizes that it’s not her phone ringing, I see fresh tears pool in her eyes. She hangs her head.
Moeka: "Why won’t you respond, FB? You’re the one who recruited me..."
UNSPOKEN: Moeka starts typing yet another mail. I guess she really doesn’t recognize me. This is frustrating. Why is she acting like the victim here? Does she think she’s a tragic heroine? Does she think she deserves sympathy? You don’t have the right to be so weak. It’s Mayuri who deserves sympathy, not you. She died countless times because of you! Murderer. I swallow the word before it passes my lips.
Rintaro: "...Dammit."
UNSPOKEN: I check my phone. It’s Kurisu calling. I stand up and move to the entrance, where I can take the call without letting Moeka out of my sight.
Rintaro: "Hello?"
Kurisu: "Finally. Where are you?"
Rintaro: "Hello."
UNSPOKEN: I stand up and move to the entrance, where I can take the call without letting Moeka out of my sight.
Kurisu: "Where are you?"
Rintaro: "...Sorry, I’m busy."
Kurisu: "Is it woman? You’re with a woman, aren’t you?"
Rintaro: "Is that the first thing that comes to mind? You really are a mainstream girl."
Kurisu: "Shut up. You promised you’d help with the PhoneWave, remember? Or is your lab mem number just for show?"
Rintaro: "Get Daru to help. I can’t do it today."
Kurisu: "...What are you doing? Where are you?"
Rintaro: "Kiryu Moeka’s apartment."
Kurisu: "So you are with a woman. You’re the worst."
