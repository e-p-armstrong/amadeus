UNSPOKEN: I silently squeeze Moeka's hand. Moeka doesn't squeeze back. She no longer has the strength.
Moeka: I had... nothing... except FB... The only... place... I belonged... I would... kill... to protect it... You're right... to hate me... I'm... so...rry...
Rintaro: I forgive you.
UNSPOKEN: The words come to my lips unbidden. But as soon as I speak them, I understand why. Moeka does not kill Mayuri on this worldline. Even if she could, it would not happen until tomorrow. This Moeka, the one dying in my arms, is innocent. And yet, even now, she says, I'm sorry. How can I not answer her?
Rintaro: I forgive you.
UNSPOKEN: Perhaps the words are meaningless. Forgiving Moeka will not cure Nae's hate. Neither will Moeka's death. I don't even know if I truly mean what I'm saying. But still, I remember what Kurisu said. My goal is to save Mayuri, not avenge her. So here, now...
Rintaro: I forgive you.
UNSPOKEN: The anguish seems to fade from Moeka's face. Her eyes slowly close. A tear slides down Moeka's cheek. Her hand slips from my grasp. She is no longer breathing. Biting my lip, I lay Moeka to rest on the floor. I place her purple phone in her hands.
Kurisu: ...Okabe.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu calls to me in a weak voice.
Kurisu: I think you should send the D-Mail. Everything's ready at the lab.
Rintaro: Yeah...
UNSPOKEN: Moeka and FB are gone, but Mayuri's fate remains unchanged. The universe still demands her death.
Rintaro: Hey, Christina. When I send the D-Mail and change divergence, do you think Moeka's fate will change?
Kurisu: Based on the attractor field model you spoke of... She'll be more likely to live if divergence exceeds 1%. ...Sorry. I wish I knew what to say.
Rintaro: Don't worry about it.
