Rintaro: So you kill Moeka... but what comes next?
Nae: Next?
Rintaro: Are you gonna repeat those fifteen years all over again?
Nae: Hmph. What do I care about those fifteen years? There's nothing for me there...
UNSPOKEN: She does not cry. She does not sneer. Her voice is flat and emotionless as she speaks these words. There's nothing more I can to say to this girl I destroyed. At last, Nae lets go of my arm. She looks in disgust at her hands, now covered in my blood.
Nae: I don't need anything from you now. Just wait in fear and regret, Okabe Rintaro. Until I come for you in fifteen years.
UNSPOKEN: I'm powerless to stop her from running away.
Rintaro: Hahaha...
UNSPOKEN: Dry laughter leaks out of my mouth. That girl's disconnected from causality, just like I am. I asked her what she would do after killing Moeka. She didn't answer.  The first time she lived those fifteen years, all she had was revenge. And after time leaping thousands of times, she exacted that revenge. How will she live those fifteen years the second time around? Will she kill me again? Will her revenge be complete then? Or will it continue forever, until even she forgets why? The thought squeezes my heart like a vise. Does time travel bring nothing but pain? We built a time machine out of curiosity. We were fools. If not for our meddling, SERN would not have targeted us. Mayuri would not have died. Suzuha would not have had to travel to the past. Faris would not have lost her father twice. Lukako would not have had to forsake her feelings for me. And Moeka would not have killed Mayuri.
Kurisu: Okabe!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu runs up to me. She turns pale at the sight of my bleeding arm.
Kurisu: What happened!? Are you okay!?
UNSPOKEN: She kneels in front of me. Worry is etched on her face.
Rintaro: The phone...
Kurisu: I brought it, but...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu hands me FB's phone. I take it and start typing out the mail with my left hand.
Kurisu: Hey, tell me what happened, will you!? Should I call an ambulance!?
Rintaro: Calm down... I'm gonna send the D-Mail now.
Kurisu: R-right. If the worldline changes, then this wound will go away.
UNSPOKEN: Yes, but who cares about my wound? Tennouji's death, Moeka's death, and the damage to Nae's soul will all be undone. That's what matters. I finish the mail and take a breath.
Rintaro: Hey... why do you think Tennouji didn't kill Moeka?
Kurisu: What do you mean?
UNSPOKEN: Any Rounder who finds an IBN 5100 is silenced. No exceptions. That's what Tennouji said. In that case, the one who should have been eliminated first was Moeka. She found the IBN 5100 in the first place. And yet, Tennouji cut contact with her instead. And when we exposed his true identity, he shot himself, not Moeka.
Rintaro: I think... I think he wanted to save Moeka.
