UNSPOKEN: No vertigo. No dizziness. Nothing. Reading Steiner didn’t activate.
Rintaro: "What? Why?"
UNSPOKEN: Why didn’t the worldline change? Did the PhoneWave fail to function? I bring my own phone back to my ear. Kurisu is still on the line.
Rintaro: "Well!?"
Kurisu: "Did you send it?"
Rintaro: "Yes. Did it work!?"
Kurisu: "The discharge is occurring as normal."
Rintaro: "So it worked, right?"
Kurisu: "Definitely."
Rintaro: "The worldline didn’t change!"
Kurisu: "You mean it failed? Why?"
UNSPOKEN: Consider the possibilities.
Rintaro: "Maybe the message wasn’t enough to persuade Moeka to change models."
Kurisu: "Could we have sent it to the wrong date?"
Rintaro: "It’s July 31st. I’m sure of it."
Kurisu: "Check when the original D-Mail arrived. Maybe her reaction will change if the new one arrives just after that."
Rintaro: "What a pain!"
UNSPOKEN: The pounding on the door has ceased. Did she finally give up? No, she wouldn’t give up. Does she plan to climb out the window and loop around? But we’re on the second floor. That would be quite a feat. I should still have some time left.
Kurisu: "Try sending different messages. If that doesn’t work, I’ll adjust the timer."
Rintaro: "You’re a lifesaver. What’s going on there? Is Mister Braun freaking out?"
Kurisu: "I can hear him shouting from below. Hashida and Mayuri are trying to calm him down, but who knows how long that’ll last. I don’t think there’s much time left."
UNSPOKEN: I put my phone into my pocket without hanging up. I change the message and send another D-Mail. ...But still, nothing happens. I make another one. Send. ...No good. Why? What am I doing wrong? I’d like to ask Moeka, but if I go back inside now, she’ll probably just attack me. Which reminds me, she’s been awfully quiet. What is she doing now? Maybe she really did go out the window. I look around. I don’t see her anywhere. Think. Why didn’t the D-Mail work? I wipe the sweat from my brow. My entire body is soaked. It must be the adrenaline. What if Moeka changed addresses when she got a new phone? I take out my phone.
Rintaro: "Are you there?"
Kurisu: "Still not working?"
Rintaro: "I tried two more times, but nothing."
UNSPOKEN: I frantically consider my options as I stare hard at Moeka’s phone. The walkway is dim, but Moeka’s gaudy purple phone shines in the faint light. Wait. I take another good look at the phone. There’s something wrong here. What is it?
Kurisu: "Okabe? What’s wrong?"
UNSPOKEN: Gaudy purple. Latest model. Removable LCD screen. Model number GG01. My eyes tell me there’s nothing wrong. I saw this phone when Moeka sent her D-Mail, and many times before. She was never without it. It’s the same. Nothing has changed.
Rintaro: "Nothing... changed?"
Kurisu: "Huh? What hasn’t changed?"
