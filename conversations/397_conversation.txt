UNSPOKEN: Moeka sits down on the tatami mats, not questioning why I'm here. She takes out her purple phone and begins typing a mail. It feels like forever since I've seen her lightning-speed typing. This mail doesn't make sense. It reads like Moeka and I were discussing the IBN 5100 just moments ago. ...Of course. That's exactly what happened on this worldline. That explains why I'm here.
Rintaro: What do you mean? Your supervisor? You mean FB?
Moeka: ...!
UNSPOKEN: So FB's still alive. I feel relief, but also fear. I mustn't forget that he is my enemy. For now, however, I'm more interested in what Moeka just said. FB canceled her mission to retrieve the IBN 5100?
Tennouji: Doing your duty sets you up for disposal. So we're more like cattle than dogs.
UNSPOKEN: I recall his last words. Perhaps he canceled her mission so that they wouldn't be eliminated. But I don't think that will prevent their deaths. They cannot escape their fate.
Nae: I won't forgive you, until I kill you with my own hands.
UNSPOKEN: I cover my ears. I can't get that childish, yet hate-filled voice out of my head. On that worldline, I turned an innocent girl into a murderer. I bite my lip hard, hard enough to draw blood. That worldline has already been undone. But how will things turn out on this new worldline? No, there's no point thinking about it. If the plan worked, the IBN 5100 should already be back in my possession. And if that's the case... Then there's no need to stay on this worldline, either.
Kurisu: ...Okabe?
Rintaro: Wasn't there something strange about that girl?
Kurisu: That girl... you mean Nae-chan?
UNSPOKEN: I nod.
Kurisu: ...She was like a different person.
Rintaro: What did she mean, she'll kill me in fifteen years?
UNSPOKEN: It bothers me. Does she know something? What was she implying?
Kurisu: Don't worry about it, Okabe. Send the D-Mail right now. That'll solve everything.
UNSPOKEN: I put FB's phone in my pocket.
Rintaro: I can't pretend I didn't see that.
UNSPOKEN: Nae's crime is partly my responsibility. And I need to know what she meant when she promised to kill me fifteen years from now.
Rintaro: I'm time leaping. Back to the lab.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu sighs, but I pretend not to hear it.
Kurisu: Our enemy? But...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu glances at Moeka, then whispers into my ear.
Kurisu: Isn't she our enemy?
Rintaro: ...It's about 7 AM, right?
Kurisu: Huh? Well, yeah, but where did that question come from?
