UNSPOKEN: The IBN 5100? Moeka, you fool, you let your tongue slip! Two weeks ago, FB told her to leave the IBN 5100 at a drop point. That means she already had it in her possession at that time. I recall how Moeka kept bombarding me with questions about the IBN 5100. I might have let it slip that I found the computer at Yanabayashi Shrine. After that, she sent her D-Mail. The worldline changed. The lock was broken on the shrine’s storehouse door. The IBN 5100 was gone. These facts point to one conclusion. She sent herself the location of the IBN 5100! Now that I know, it seems so obvious. If only I hadn’t trusted Moeka. If only I had seen through her lies. But no, I played right into her hands. I was the tool’s tool. I almost burst into self-deriding laughter. But I desperately hold it back, and keep a straight face.
Rintaro: "What was the designated location?"
Moeka: "The coin locker... in front of Daibiru..."
UNSPOKEN: The coin locker in front of Daibiru... Wait, isn’t that where Lukako hid the IBN 5100 on the previous worldline? Is this another effect of convergence? Can I retrieve the IBN 5100 if I go there now? No, I can’t expect it to still be there. Remember what happened with Lukako. The invisible force of convergence is keeping the IBN 5100 away from me. If I want to get it back, I need to cancel Moeka’s D-Mail. I know the message. I’ve already reached my goal.
Moeka: "*sob*..."
UNSPOKEN: Moeka starts crying softly. I sigh deeply and lift myself off Moeka’s body. Then I lean back against the wall and stretch my aching limbs. I take Moeka’s phone out of my pocket.
Rintaro: "I’m using your phone."
UNSPOKEN: Moeka slowly gets up. She wipes her tears and fixes her hair and clothes. Her wavy hair obscures her face from this angle, so I can’t make out her expression. She doesn’t react to what I said. Even though I’m no longer restraining her, she doesn’t try to attack me and take back her phone. I open Moeka’s mailbox and search for the D-Mail. It takes about three minutes, but I finally find it. Three mails from Moeka’s own phone, each 12 characters long, sent on August 4th and received on July 31st. RetroPC’s at Yanabayashi Shrine Just as I suspected. Moeka changed her D-Mail in the few seconds I had my back turned. All I need to do now is send the cancellation mail.
Kurisu: "Okabe!?"
Rintaro: "You at the lab?"
Kurisu: "Haah... don’t worry me like that... idiot..."
Rintaro: "What, were you worried about me?"
Kurisu: "I-I mean, you set off an obvious death flag. I’m surprised you’re still alive!"
