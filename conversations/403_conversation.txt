UNSPOKEN: This may just be wishful thinking. We’ll never know FB’s true intentions. But I want to believe that Tennouji did care for her, that there was a place for Moeka somewhere. ...What am I doing? Why am I trying to comfort Moeka? Maybe I’m just soft.
Kurisu: "Okabe! We need to send the D-Mail now."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu’s expression is grave.
Kurisu: "Miss this chance, and you could be in a lot of trouble."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu had the same thought as me.
Kurisu: "Your goal is to save Mayuri, not take revenge on SERN. Right? ...I don’t want anyone else to be hurt because of the machine we built."
Rintaro: "...Yeah. You’re right."
UNSPOKEN: FB’s phone is in my possession. There’s no longer any reason to stay on this worldline. It’s only a matter of time until the police come looking for us. I should send the D-Mail immediately. When I do, the present will be reconstructed. Tennouji will still be alive. Moeka will still be in contact with FB. And at last, the IBN 5100 will return to me. I just need to think about saving Mayuri, and all will be well.
Rintaro: "Do you think Daru’s still in the lab?"
Kurisu: "I’ll try calling."
UNSPOKEN: I’ll send the same message I tried to send earlier from Moeka’s phone. Only this time, it will be from FB’s phone. When Moeka sees it, she’ll believe it to be an order from FB. Knowing her dependence on FB, she’ll obey without question. It makes me sick to be taking advantage of Moeka’s vulnerabilities like this. How am I any different from FB?
Kurisu: "He said he’ll be there in five minutes."
UNSPOKEN: So we just wait until then.
Kurisu: "By the way, something weird happened back there."
UNSPOKEN: After closing her phone, Kurisu glances at Moeka and lowers her voice.
Kurisu: "While I was waiting outside, I heard a gunshot. And right after that... I saw her."
Rintaro: "Her... who?"
UNSPOKEN: I ask, even though I already know the answer. There’s only one person it could be.
Kurisu: "Nae-chan. She ran out the back door. When I called her to stop... our eyes met."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu bites her lip, as if fighting an unpleasant memory. It happened right after she heard the gunshot. If that’s true, then Nae saw her father die. She saw her father die... and ran away.
Rintaro & Kurisu: "Wha!?"
UNSPOKEN: There’s a knock on the door. Someone’s here. Who? Moeka, who had been squatting by the entrance, slowly lifts her head. This is wrong. The timing’s too perfect. Today, Kiryu Moeka dies. This worldline has already approved that fate. Has it come for her already? Moeka reaches for the doorknob.
Rintaro: "Wait! Don’t--"
