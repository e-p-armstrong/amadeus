UNSPOKEN: We arrive at the lab. I look up at the second floor, but there's no light in the window. Oddly enough, there's nobody here today. I've got a bad feeling about this. Is Moeka going to ambush us? On the previous worldline, I forgave Moeka and Tennouji. But that has already been undone. This is a new worldline. The Rounders are still alive, and they're still after the Time Leap Machine.
Rintaro: Wait here, Mayuri.
UNSPOKEN: I motion for her to sit and wait on the bench in front. Then I carefully check the area. I know my efforts are likely futile. But still, I want to do anything I can. Anything to give Mayuri a chance, however small, of surviving on this worldline. Something tells me it would be foolish to go straight up to the lab. So first, I decide to check the street for any suspicious people. I walk down the street towards Kuramaebashi-dori, careful to always keep Mayuri in sight.
Rintaro: ...?
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, a white station wagon parked at the end of the street fires its engine and takes off in our direction.
Rintaro: Wha...
UNSPOKEN: I can see clearly through the front window. The man in the driver's seat is unfamiliar. But I have seen that station wagon before. It's the same one Moeka used to run us over on a previous worldline. The same one Tennouji used to transport the IBN 5100. And now it's bearing down on me at full speed. I'm in the center of the road. There's nowhere to run! The station wagon flips on its high beams, instantly turning my vision white. I can't move. It's all happening too fast. I expected an ambush inside the lab. Instead, I'm facing a charging car. What do I do!? I'm fine. I won't die. This worldline hasn't approved that fate. No, wait. What day is it? This is the first time I've made it to the 17th. Does that mean my death is still undecided? Will I die in Mayuri's place? If that will save her... if that will end this... then maybe it's for the best. No! I don't want to die yet! Two contradictory emotions collide in my mind. My body doesn't know which way to turn. Will I be the one to die?
Mayuri: Okarin!!
Rintaro: !?
UNSPOKEN: Something slams into my back. I open my eyes. I'm lying on the side of the road. My whole body hurts, but I don't appear to be seriously injured. Someone saved me? I look up to see the station wagon's taillights disappearing around the corner. And there, lying in the center of the road... is Mayuri.
Rintaro: Mayuri!
UNSPOKEN: I run to her side. Mayuri is bleeding from the head. The pavement is slick with blood. Did she... protect me? But that's not what I wanted! I lift her body up in my arms. Her eyes twitch, then slowly open.
Mayuri: O...kari...
