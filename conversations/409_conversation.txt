Rintaro: Ah, it must have been an illusion. We could be under attack from Illusion Conductor, one of the Organization's feared agents.
Mayuri: Oh... gotta be careful, then. But you know, I'm sure that Mr. Illusion Kidhugger--
Rintaro: Conductor. Not Kidhugger.
Mayuri: I'm sure he's not a bad guy.
UNSPOKEN: It was nothing. Just meaningless chatter to pass the time.
Mayuri: I felt so happy there. So happy I could cry. I wanted to stay like that forever. Ah! But that doesn't mean I don't like how things are now, okay?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri shakes her head in denial. Finally, she stops looking up at the sky, and bows her head instead.
Mayuri: You know, I haven't talked to Okarin much lately. Maybe Mayushii's getting a little lonely.
UNSPOKEN: It's true. I haven't had time to talk to her lately. But that's because I've been fighting to prevent her death. To keep her dreams from coming true. All so that Mayuri will keep smiling. I never again want to see her cry like she did on the day her grandmother died.
Mayuri: But you know, I don't want to be a burden on Okarin.
UNSPOKEN: That word again. Burden. I've never thought of her as a burden.
Mayuri: Mayushii's just one big nuisance, isn't she... Um, Granny?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri lifts her face once more.
Mayuri: ...I can't stay like this forever, can I?
Rintaro: Of course you can!
Mayuri: Huh?
UNSPOKEN: When I finally speak to Mayuri, she turns my way with a surprised expression. Her face is so soft, so innocent. Slowly, her lips curve into a smile.
Mayuri: It's Okarin♪ Wow, how'd you know I was here?
Rintaro: I always know where my hostage is.
Mayuri: Hostage...
Rintaro: You cannot escape my grasp. Not ever.
Mayuri: Oh... But don't wear yourself out, okay? Mayushii's a little worried.
Rintaro: ...Hououin Kyouma is not so weak as to require your concern. When the time comes, I'll tell you everything.
Mayuri: ...Huh?
Rintaro: So stay with me until then, like you always have.
Mayuri: ...Okay.
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri stands up and turns to the grave once more. As an offering, she leaves a brand new white lily, as well as some dango dumplings.
Mayuri: Let's head back, Okarin.
Rintaro: Shouldn't we get some dango for ourselves first?
UNSPOKEN: Back when we used to visit the cemetery together, it was part of our daily routine to eat dango on the way back.
Mayuri: Ehehe! Of course♪
