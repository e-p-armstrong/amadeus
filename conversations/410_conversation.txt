Rintaro: "That’s not the problem!"
UNSPOKEN: I fight the urge to grind my teeth. Instead, I fix Kurisu with my stare.
Rintaro: "It’s taken me so long -- so long -- just to reach this point! This is my chance to escape the Alpha worldline and save Mayuri. I won’t let anyone get in my way. Anyone!"
Kurisu: "Okabe..."
Itaru: "W-why so serious, man?"
UNSPOKEN: I’ve got good reason. To them, only half an hour has passed since the Time Leap Machine was built. But to me, many days have passed since this ordeal began.
Rintaro: "Please!"
UNSPOKEN: I bow my head deeply.
Rintaro: "Please, hear me out."
UNSPOKEN: Or else Mayuri will die, and in 26 years, the world will be ruled by SERN. Suzuha’s sacrifice will have been for nothing. Daru claps me on the shoulder, then smiles broadly and thrusts his thumb skyward.
Itaru: "I-it’s not like I’m cracking for you or anything, okay!?"
Kurisu: "Oh god..."
UNSPOKEN: I burst out in laughter. Sir Super Hacka (tsundere version) is here to save the day. I couldn’t have asked for a better right-hand man. As Daru hooks the IBN 5100 to his PC, I explain the situation one more time. Let’s hope this is the last.
Rintaro: "This all happened because of the very first D-Mail I sent to Daru. SERN intercepted that D-Mail with Echelon and figured out what it meant, then sent their Rounders after us. They will kill Mayuri, kidnap us, and steal the Time Leap Machine."
UNSPOKEN: Some years after that, I assume, Daru and I escape and form the Resistance to which Suzuha belonged.
Rintaro: "I tried to save Mayuri, but nothing worked. Every worldline converged on the same result, just as attractor field theory said they would."
Itaru: "You know, if this is all in your head, I think you’ve got a career as a light novel author ahead of you."
Rintaro: "It’s true. All of it. To prevent Mayuri’s death..."
UNSPOKEN: And to free Suzuha’s future from SERN...
Rintaro: "We need to escape from the Alpha worldline. And I think we can do that by canceling all of our changes to the timeline so far. That should return us to the Beta worldline, the worldline that existed before I sent that first D-Mail. There’s just one more step. We need to erase the first D-Mail from SERN’s database."
UNSPOKEN: If what Suzuha said is correct, then erasing that data will take us over 1% divergence and back to the Beta worldline. It was just one short email, barely 36 bytes, but it changed the course of human history. The Butterfly Effect. 
Kurisu: "Fascinating."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu mutters as she sips her hot coffee. It looks like she’s already recovered from her exhaustion.
Itaru: "You believe him, Makise-shi?"
Kurisu: "In theory. I’d like to see objective data, but that’s obviously impossible."
Rintaro: "Relax. Your Time Leap Machine worked perfectly."
