UNSPOKEN: She doesn’t deny it. That’s just like Kurisu.
Kurisu: "Besides, we were already planning to crack SERN’s database, weren’t we? Fine. Let’s see what’s in there. If the mail data exists, then it’s proof that what you said is true."
Itaru: "So what you’re saying is, ’don’t think, feel.’ Got it."
Kurisu: "Uh, you lost me."
Rintaro: "What he meant to say was, ’don’t think, do.’"
UNSPOKEN: Daru extracts his massive body from the space behind the desk, plops himself down on the chair, and wipes away his sweat.
Itaru: "Done bridging them. I need to tinker with the settings a little, but we should be up and running in about ten minutes."
Rintaro: "Alright."
Kurisu: "So the first D-Mail started everything... Was that the one you showed me at ATF? The one that said I died or something."

UNSPOKEN: My voice trails off. Something is telling me to stop. Fear rises in my chest, a sudden, terrible certainty that I am missing something vital. I frantically replay the conversation in my head. We must cancel all of our changes to the timeline so far. The very first D-Mail started it all. The one that said I died or something. Return to the worldline that existed before I sent the first D-Mail.
Rintaro: "...!"
UNSPOKEN: An icy fist seizes my heart, and I turn to Kurisu with a look of pure terror. Our eyes meet. Those eyes of hers no longer show the sharp defiance from when we first met. Instead, they glow warmly with the light of curiosity.
Kurisu: "What?"
