UNSPOKEN: I thought that I was alone, but someone was here before me. Kurisu is lying in the middle of the roof, arms and legs spread as if making a snow angel. The image of Kurisu in a pool of blood flashes through my mind. Is she alright!? I run towards her, but before I make it halfway, she suddenly sits up and turns to face me.
Kurisu: ...Okabe.
Rintaro: You're alive...
UNSPOKEN: What a dumb thing to say. Fortunately, it looks like Kurisu didn't hear me. She's busy combing her disheveled hair with her fingers. I breathe a silent sigh of relief.
Kurisu: Right. I forgot I might run into you here.
Rintaro: What were you doing?
Kurisu: ...Thinking.
Rintaro: Oh...
UNSPOKEN: Was she thinking about her death? I don't know what to say, so I keep my mouth shut. Kurisu appears to be in the same boat. She's staring at the capsule toy dispenser in the corner, her face wearing the usual frown. The awkward silence drags on. When you think about it, Kurisu's fate rests in my hands. My decision will determine whether she lives or dies. Her fantastic hypothesis yesterday was a desperate attempt to construct a scenario where she doesn't die. Even if she believes that her theory is correct, it must be difficult for her to avoid imagining her own death. I force a smile. I'm getting really uncomfortable here.
Rintaro: Looks like I'm in your way, so I'll just go.
Kurisu: ...Oh, okay.
UNSPOKEN: Damn. I was expecting a sarcastic remark like Since when do mad scientists have manners? or something. Just then, something cold lands on the tip of my nose. When I look up, raindrops start landing on my forehead. An evening shower. It's only going to get more intense, and quickly. Kurisu hasn't moved a muscle. She's just standing there with her arms folded, staring at the ground as if she doesn't notice the rain at all.
Rintaro: Hey. It's raining.
Kurisu: Huh? Oh, yeah.
UNSPOKEN: She's acting strange, like her mind is elsewhere. I knew it. She's been thinking about...
Rintaro: Whoa!
UNSPOKEN: In less than a minute, the rain turns into a full downpour. We had no time to seek shelter.
Kurisu: What the hell!?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's scream is drowned out by the roar of the rain.
Kurisu: Whew, what a surprise.
Rintaro: That's what you get for tempting the sky gods.
UNSPOKEN: Now safely inside the building, we take a moment to catch our breath. It's been a week since Suzuha's time machine disappeared, but Radi-Kan is still closed. The lights are off, and it's pretty dark inside.
Kurisu: You should've warned me sooner. Even my underwear's soaked.
Rintaro: Same here. I bet you're glad it's dark, huh?
Kurisu: What do you mean?
Rintaro: If the lights were on, I'd be able to see everything.
Kurisu: ...!
UNSPOKEN: Even in the dim light, I can tell that Kurisu is scrambling to cover her chest.
Kurisu: Ugh, I forgot that you're a perv too.
