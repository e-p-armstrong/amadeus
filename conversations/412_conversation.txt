Rintaro: "What are you gonna do now? Head straight home?"
Mayuri: "Actually, I was thinking of going to the lab."
Rintaro: "Need something?"
Mayuri: "Not really, but it’s been a while since I got to relax with Okarin. I’m a little hungry, so I’ll buy some Juicy Chicken Number One on the way."
UNSPOKEN: Maybe Mayuri wants a taste of normalcy again, now that the chaos of ComiMa has ended. I can’t begrudge her that. I stifle a groan and shrug my shoulders.
Rintaro: "Back to the lab, then."
Mayuri: "Hey, Okarin. Why did you come with Mayushii today? You’ve never come with me to ComiMa before. You’re not interested in moe, right?"
Rintaro: "I like robot anime."
UNSPOKEN: But not so much that I’d line up early in the morning for ComiMa each year, like Daru and Mayuri do.
Mayuri: "So why did you come with me today?"
Rintaro: "Well..."
UNSPOKEN: To confirm your death. Those words pop into my head, but I quickly shake them away. Why am I so set on Mayuri dying? I want her to live, remember?
Mayuri: "Well?"
Rintaro: "...I just felt like it."
Mayuri: "Oh..."
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, silence. A downhearted frown replaces the usual smile on Mayuri’s face. Did my answer upset her? But it’s not like I could tell her the truth. How do you tell someone they’re going to die?
Rintaro: "Lukako..."
UNSPOKEN: I frantically try to smooth things over.
Rintaro: "I thought maybe you’d managed to get Lukako to cosplay, so I came to laugh at him. Too bad he didn’t come."
Mayuri: "Yeah... Luka-kun would be super popular if he did come, though. People would take his picture and post it all over the internet, then everyone in the world would see how cute he is! And after he became a superstar, Mayushii would see him on TV and think, ’wow, he’s gone so far...’"
Rintaro: "It’s scary ’cause it’s true."
Mayuri: "...Okarin?"
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Mayuri turns around, and peeks at my face as she walks backwards.
Mayuri: "Thank you for today."
Rintaro: "Why are you thanking me?"
Mayuri: "Ehehe! Well, like I said, this is the first time Okarin’s ever come to ComiMa with me. It made Mayushii really happy♪"
UNSPOKEN: A smile finally returns to Mayuri’s face.
Mayuri: "Ah, but you know what would make me even happier? If you cosplay next time!"
Rintaro: "...Yeah, I’ll think about it."
UNSPOKEN: That’s right. Don’t think negative thoughts. Think about a fun, bright future.
Mayuri: "Really? You’ll cosplay for me?"
Rintaro: "Only if you cosplay too. Lukako too... and Christina, of course. Convince them to cosplay first. If you manage that, then I, the great and insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, will grace ComiMa with my august presence."
