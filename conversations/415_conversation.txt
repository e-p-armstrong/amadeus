Kurisu: "But I take the Yamanote Line to Osaki, then transfer to the Shonan-Shinjuku Line. Another person -- say, Hashida-san -- might decide to take the Keihin Tohoku Line for some reason. And Mayuri might ride the Shinkansen from Tokyo. You and I ride the same train until Tokyo Station. But from there, we ride different lines, while still aiming for the same destination."
Rintaro: "And that applies to the universe? You’re claiming the existence of parallel worlds?"
Kurisu: "...I like to use my imagination too, sometimes. But where’s the proof that there’s only one world?"
Rintaro: "Suzuha said so... and then there’s Reading Steiner."
Kurisu: "In other words, an unknown time traveler and your unexplainable super power."
Rintaro: "But we knew Suzuha..."
Kurisu: "There’s no way to prove that she was Hashida’s daughter, or anything she said about 2036 either. Not without going there ourselves. And if Reading Steiner is what you say, then it means that your subjective experience influences the memories of every single human being. That’s completely absurd, Okabe. If it’s true, then you’re literally a god. But there are no gods in reality. The world doesn’t revolve around you. It’s just your brain making you believe that it does. If that makes you this world’s god, then I must be a god too. My brain is just as big as yours."
Rintaro: "What are you trying to say?"
Kurisu: "Let’s say you choose the worldline where I die. That doesn’t mean I have to do the same. The fact is that I am standing here right now, observing the world with my own subjectivity. I already exist on a worldline where I don’t die. Even if your perspective shifts to the Beta worldline, my perspective might remain here. It’s a question of where the soul lies. And I won’t let you have your way with my soul."
Rintaro: "No true scientist would accept a hypothesis that flimsy."
Kurisu: "But there’s a chance I’m right. So you have nothing to worry about."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu smiles. How can she smile? I just told her that she’s going to die.
Kurisu: "The problem is that you don’t want to let me die, right? But if my hypothesis is correct, I’ll still be alive on another possible worldline. So there’s no reason to be afraid."
Rintaro: "It’s just a hypothesis."
Kurisu: "The same is true of attractor fields. It hasn’t been proven. Even if someone did prove it by 2036, that doesn’t help us here in the present. In other words... Anything is possible."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu turns her back to me after finishing. It’s an armchair theory. A daring armchair theory that could, quite possibly, render meaningless everything I’ve done up to now. How can Kurisu stay so calm? She’s just an 18-year-old girl.
Kurisu: "You really don’t have to worry about me, Okabe. It would just hurt my pride if you did."
Rintaro: "Don’t say it like that."
