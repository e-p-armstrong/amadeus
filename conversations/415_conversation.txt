Rintaro: I know... but I'm still going to try!
UNSPOKEN: I won't lose Mayuri or Kurisu.
Kurisu: Kuh...
UNSPOKEN: I hear Kurisu grinding her teeth. Then she turns her back to me.
Kurisu: Have it your way! But I'm not helping. I'm going back to America, and that's that. Goodbye. I don't expect we'll meet again, Hououin Kyouma.
Rintaro: Kuh...
Kurisu: I can't believe this! How stupid can you be? You're so... stupid!
