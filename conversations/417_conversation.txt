UNSPOKEN: I’ve failed so many times to save her. I’ve watched her die again and again. Everything I’ve done has been to prevent that from happening. And yet, have the memories of those deaths been tormenting her as she sleeps? I bite my lip in frustration. I still have a terrible decision to make. Do I save Mayuri? Or do I save Kurisu? There’s no perfect ending here. I can’t save them both. It’s one... or the other. If I choose Kurisu, then Mayuri’s dreams will become reality. I don’t want Mayuri to feel any pain. Until now, I’ve thought only of saving her. That is my goal. But at the same time, I can’t let Kurisu die. Again, my thoughts hit the same dead end. Mayuri hasn’t noticed me yet. She’s still staring at the sky, just as she was on the day I took her hostage. She’s talking to her grandmother in heaven.
Mayuri: "Oh, right! We have a lot more lab mems now, you know! There’s Chris-chan, Moeka-san, Luka-kun, and Feris-chan. There’s also Suzu-san, but she moved away. That makes eight of us. It’s really amazing."
UNSPOKEN: On this worldline, they all became lab mems. However, not a single one of them has sent a D-Mail.
Mayuri: "You know, it was just Okarin and Mayushii at first. Back then, Okarin seemed kinda bored most of the time. But now, he’s having so much fun."
UNSPOKEN: Is that how she sees it? Well... she’s not wrong. She really does know me, doesn’t she.
Mayuri: "And that makes Mayushii happy too! It’s so busy, but it’s really exciting. Especially now that Chris-chan is here. She’s really smart, you know. She got a paper published in a famous magazine! Mayushii really admires her. She even made a time machine! Oh, but can’t forget Okarin and Daru-kun helped too."
UNSPOKEN: Then Mayuri falls silent. Her gaze becomes distant. She stands still, and looks up to the sky. What could she be thinking?
Mayuri: "But you know, sometimes I remember... Back when it was just the two of us. When Mayushii had only just become Okarin’s hostage. I’d go to the lab after school, but Okarin wouldn’t be there. So I’d tidy up the room, and decorate it with cute things. Then Okarin would finally show up a little later. Mayushii would say ’welcome back’. But instead of saying ’I’m back,’ Okarin would say ’Good work,’ like a big boss or something. Every day, we’d spend a few hours just hanging out, doing nothing, and then we’d go home together. We didn’t talk much, but it wasn’t bad. We were just there... together, you know? We’d sit next to each other on the sofa. Okarin would work on his big plans, and Mayushii would read manga or play games. And sometimes we’d have a snack together. It was so nice and relaxing... I never wanted to leave. I’d start feeling like a real hostage, and I’d laugh ’ehehe’ to myself. Then Okarin would turn to me and say..."
UNSPOKEN: I remember... It was four months ago. Still spring. The lab wasn’t as lively as it is now. It was an isolated bubble of slow-moving time.
Rintaro: "Did something good happen?"
