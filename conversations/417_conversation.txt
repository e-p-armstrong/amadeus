UNSPOKEN: I turn around in surprise, and there I see Kurisu standing in the doorway. I thought she never wanted to see me again. Why is she here?
Rintaro: Why...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu ignores my question and fixes me with her usual glare.
Kurisu: Time leaping is just running away.
UNSPOKEN: You don't have to tell me. I already know. I know all too well. In the end, all I'm doing is running away. Running from responsibility. Running from the decision. If I had known I would have to make this choice, then I would have refused Suzuha when she entrusted me with her mission.
Rintaro: I've hurt people... lots of people... just to save Mayuri. And yet, I don't even feel guilty anymore. I feel like I'm losing my humanity.
Kurisu: Then why are you hesitating now?
Rintaro: ...Maybe because my insurance, the Time Leap Machine, isn't effective. Or maybe I just haven't mastered it yet. Maybe I haven't tapped into its full potential.
Kurisu: Running only makes it hurt more.
UNSPOKEN: She suddenly looks away. Then she leans against the wall and smiles bitterly.
Kurisu: I should know.
UNSPOKEN: Is Kurisu running too? From what?
Kurisu: Look at yourself, Okabe. You look like you've aged a decade. Your heart can't take it anymore. You don't need to beat yourself up like this. Just accept the truth. Like I said, you can't stay here. Go to the Beta worldline. Go to the world where Mayuri doesn't die. Not just for your sake, but for mine as well.
UNSPOKEN: She's right. I have no other options left. No more D-Mails. No more time leaps. There's no perfect world where both Kurisu and Mayuri live. Maybe there are things I have yet to try, but I'm certain that all of them will end in vain. As long as I stay on this worldline, Mayuri will die. And if I go to the Beta worldline, Kurisu will die. We'll never be able to talk like this again. It's only been twenty days since we met, and yet... Memories of Kurisu flash before my eyes.
Kurisu: Thank you. I know you're hurting for me.
