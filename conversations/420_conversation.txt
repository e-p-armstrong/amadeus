Itaru: ...You sure?
Rintaro: ...Yeah.
Itaru: Okey-dokey!
UNSPOKEN: Daru starts typing on the IBN 5100. It's already connected to his main computer. This will get us into SERN's central database, where they keep the data they mine with Echelon. There we will locate the first D-Mail I sent on July 28th, and erase all trace of its existence. With this, I can reach the Beta worldline. At last, Mayuri will be safe. I look at Mayuri. She's on the couch, sitting straight as a ramrod, with her grandmother's pocket watch pressed to her ear. She stays still, her eyes closed. Whenever Mayuri wants to calm down, she listens to the sound of that pocket watch. Earlier, I told Mayuri everything. I guess she's come to terms with it, in her own way. The actual work, I've left to Daru. No problem there. While waiting for him to finish, I walk into the development room. In the center of the room is the Time Leap Machine. I squat down and gently brush my fingers against the microwave's surface. It's cool to the touch. I've made irreplaceable friends because of this thing. And because of this thing, I've hurt them. But I don't want to blame the tool. It's how you use the tool that matters. And I've got to admit, it's saved me more than once. But still. Once this is over, I'll destroy the Time Leap Machine. We must never make the same mistakes again.
Itaru: Okarin, I found it! It's really there!
Rintaro: The D-Mail I sent? It's there!?
Itaru: It sure is, man.
UNSPOKEN: Daru points to a string of characters. My name is there, followed by the message I wrote about Kurisu's death. Three lines total, each twelve characters long. This data led SERN to our doorstep. At FB's instruction, Moeka and the Rounders attacked. If Suzuha is right, then by erasing this data, we will escape from Attractor Field Alpha, where SERN dominates the future. That will take us to Attractor Field Beta. To the Beta worldline within its range of convergence. To a future without Mayuri's death. Mayuri is standing next to me, gazing intently at the monitor. She grasps my hand firmly.
Mayuri: Okarin...
Rintaro: It's okay.
UNSPOKEN: She looks anxious, so I pat her head to calm her down.
Itaru: Everything's set. One press of the enter key, and that data's gone.
UNSPOKEN: Daru stands up and gestures to the open seat.
Itaru: I leave that honor to you, Okarin.
UNSPOKEN: I sit down and face the keyboard. This time. This time, it ends. Kurisu's face floats through my mind. I close my eyes and take a deep breath. ...Goodbye, Kurisu. Slowly, I raise my right hand and extend my index finger.
Rintaro: Victory is at hand!
UNSPOKEN: Daru twitches at my cry.
Rintaro: With unimaginable brilliance and unwavering conviction, I have defeated our vast and powerful enemy and now stand triumphant on the field of Ragnarok! I give thanks to the comrades... whose sacrifice made this victory possible!
