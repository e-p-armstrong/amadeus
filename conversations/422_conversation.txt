Kurisu: "Then you come to me for help. You’re so desperate, so earnest, that I just have to do what I can. N-not that I’m doing it for you, okay!? I just want to save Mayuri, that’s all. Anyway, these images are stuck in my head, like memories."
UNSPOKEN: So Kurisu’s the same. She still has faint memories from previous worldlines.
Kurisu: "I tried self-analysis. Maybe I’m mistaking dreams for reality, projecting my hopes and fantasies... I don’t know. But there’s one thing I do know. You have to save Mayuri."
Rintaro: "...Aren’t you afraid?"
UNSPOKEN: To save Mayuri, I must undo the current worldline. If I do that, Kurisu will die.
Kurisu: "You know, it kinda feels like we’re trapped in an ancient ruin."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu suddenly changes the subject. She looks around the dark, empty stairwell.
Kurisu: "Like the world ended... And we’re the only two people left. I’ve been thinking. Say you go to the Beta worldline, and everyone else goes with you. What if I can’t go with you? What if I’m the only one left behind? Would the entire world become like this place? It’s just a theory... but I can’t help but wonder."
Rintaro: "I..."
UNSPOKEN: I need to say it.
Rintaro: "I’ll save you. Not just Mayuri, but--"
Kurisu: "Don’t make promises you can’t keep!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu cuts me off sharply, then buries her face in her knees.
Kurisu: "You asked me if I wasn’t afraid. ...Of course I’m afraid. Maybe I’ll disappear. Maybe I’ll be left behind all alone. Or maybe only you will disappear and everything else will stay the same. The world will continue, and nobody will even know that you existed. I’ll go back to America as if nothing ever happened. Maybe... maybe... maybe! I feel hopeless, just thinking about all the possibilities. But even so!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu raises her head and spears me with her glare.
Kurisu: "Do you think I would tell you to let Mayuri die!?"
Rintaro: "Kurisu..."
Kurisu: "Jesus, it’s cold!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu grabs her own arms. In the darkness, I see her shoulders shaking.
Kurisu: "It’s because of these wet clothes! This sucks. Anyway, enough of this nonsense. It’s nothing but conjecture. Baseless. Worthless. I want to cut open my skull and excise the part of my brain that comes up with these delusions."
