Rintaro: "But..."
Kurisu: "No buts. My answer won’t change. Save Mayuri."
UNSPOKEN: I hear the pain in her voice... and also the resolve. Kurisu has made up her mind. I look away and clench my fists. My nails dig into the palms of my hands.
Rintaro: "Are you telling me to give up!? To abandon you!? I could never do that!"
Kurisu: "You can, and you must! There’s no other way."
Rintaro: "No! You’re our friend! I won’t abandon you!"
Kurisu: "Okabe!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu drops to her knees and grabs me by the collar. I gasp for breath as she stares into my eyes. Her eyes are hard and stern. It’s always like this when she scolds me. Always the same glare...
Kurisu: "Is there another solution? There isn’t, is there? I don’t want to live if it means sacrificing Mayuri! If you don’t save her, I’ll never forgive you!"
Rintaro: "Guh..."
UNSPOKEN: This can’t be happening! I hate this choice with no right answer. I hate the universe for being so cruel. And most of all, I hate myself for forcing Kurisu to speak these words when she is the one with the most to lose. Tears well up in my eyes, but I bite my lip and hold them back. Is there really no other way? I can’t bear it. I look straight back at Kurisu as she holds me by the collar...
Kurisu: "Eh...?"
UNSPOKEN: And tightly embrace her slender body. Her clothes are still wet from the rain, but all I feel is warmth radiating from the core of her being.
Rintaro: "But you’re right here! Why does it have to be this way!?"
Kurisu: "Okabe..."
UNSPOKEN: Tension drains from her back and her hands. She gives her whole body to my embrace.
Kurisu: "Thank you. I know you’re hurting for me. But you’ve done enough. I’m fine, so just think about Mayuri, okay?"
UNSPOKEN: Despite her fear, Kurisu has made her choice. It’s time for me to do the same. I need to decide, here and now. The future of the world. Which friend to let die. Holding Kurisu tightly, I whisper into her ear...
Rintaro: "I won’t give up. Ever!"
Kurisu: "...Kuh!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu suddenly pushes me away. She steps back. Her face is hidden behind her hair. But her fists are trembling. Her body exudes raw fury.
Kurisu: "This is ridiculous! You... motherfucker!"
Rintaro: "Whoa!"
Kurisu: "I said I was fine! What do you mean you won’t give up!? Are you stupid? Wanna die? Are you trying to be a hero, you chuunibyou wackjob? Don’t make promises you can’t keep! Your stupidity is infuriating! Why can’t you just do as I say!?"
Rintaro: "I..."
Kurisu: "What’s the problem, huh!? If you weigh the options logically, saving Mayuri is the only--"
Rintaro: "Fuck logic!"
Kurisu: "...!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu stares at me in shock.
Rintaro: "I’m not God! Maybe I got close, but that’s not me! I can’t decide who lives and who dies anymore!"
