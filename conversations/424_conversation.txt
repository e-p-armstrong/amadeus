UNSPOKEN: I'm standing by the dumpster out back of the lab. We just finished dumping the last of the trash. This morning, I called Daru, and together we dismantled the PhoneWave and the IBN 5100.
Itaru: Man, what a waste. That thing was worth a fortune.
Mayuri: And now we don't have a microwave... How will Mayushii eat her Juicy Chicken Number One?
Rintaro: Come on. I'll get you a new microwave.
UNSPOKEN: We no longer need the PhoneWave, that miraculous time machine built by coincidence. It brought Kurisu into my life. But at the same time, it made many people suffer. It must never be used again. Not by me. Not by anyone. It's time for the PhoneWave to die. And with it, the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, lord of space and time. I recall what Kurisu once said.
Kurisu: I don't want to deny who I've been. Because even my failures are a part of who I am today.
UNSPOKEN: I gaze once more upon the scrap heap that was Future Gadget No. 8. We stripped it down to the last bolt and circuit board. Surely no one can rebuild it now. Time travel is too much power for any human to wield. We don't need D-Mails or time leaps. Even if nothing in the future is guaranteed. Even though I may die tomorrow. Life was never meant to be redone. And that's fine by me. Wouldn't you say so too, Kurisu? I look up at the sky, and even though it's the middle of the day, I can see a single star shining. Maybe it's Venus. Which suddenly reminds me.
Kurisu: Going to the past is possible right now. Look into the sky at night, and you can see how things were tens of thousands of years ago.
UNSPOKEN: Every night, we casually travel through time. That's what Kurisu said. And each and every word she spoke, I carve into my heart. So that I'll never let them slip from memory. For as long as my life endures. She said to meet her on the roof of Radi-Kan. When I get there, I find it cordoned off. The roof was off-limits to begin with, but now it's also part of a crime scene. As if I needed another reminder of the murder that took place here three weeks ago. I duck under the yellow tape and open the door. The lock is still broken. I can hardly breathe after running up the stairs to get here. As I gasp for air, I look across the stark white concrete. And naturally, my eyes go straight to the satellite sitting smack-dab in the middle of the roof.
Rintaro: No way...
Mayuri: Wow! What's that?
Itaru: It's a robot, right? The transforming kind?
