Rintaro: "This time..."
UNSPOKEN: This time, I want to save both of them, without sacrificing anyone.
Kurisu: "Hmph!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu turns away with a frown, then starts tapping her foot in a clear gesture of displeasure.
Kurisu: "There’s nothing you can do. It’s the choice of Steins Gate. Isn’t that what you always say? The equation is proven, Okabe. There’s no escape. You’re just one man. No matter how hard you try, you can’t overcome the will of the universe."
Rintaro: "I know... but I’m still going to try!"
UNSPOKEN: I won’t lose Mayuri or Kurisu.
Kurisu: "Kuh..."
UNSPOKEN: I hear Kurisu grinding her teeth. Then she turns her back to me.
Kurisu: "Have it your way! But I’m not helping. I’m going back to America, and that’s that. Goodbye. I don’t expect we’ll meet again, Hououin Kyouma."
Rintaro: "Kuh..."
Kurisu: "I can’t believe this! How stupid can you be? You’re so... stupid!"
