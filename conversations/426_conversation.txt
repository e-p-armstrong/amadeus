Suzuha: Wait. You mean you've been to another attractor field? Wow. So that's the power of Reading Steiner.
Rintaro: ...How do you know about that?
Suzuha: Dad told me. And I've met you before, Uncle Okarin. In the future, that is.
Rintaro: You've... met me?
Suzuha: I see... so the me of that attractor field went to the past too...
UNSPOKEN: A faint smile flickers across her face, then she looks at me with renewed intensity.
Suzuha: Uncle Okarin. I know you don't want to, but--
Rintaro: No. I won't let Kurisu's death be in vain. I won't let Mayuri die.
Mayuri: Huh? Mayushii dies?
Suzuha: By Kurisu, I assume you mean Makise Kurisu? Listen, Uncle. Let's say -- hypothetically -- that the only way to change the future of this worldline is to go to July 28th, 2010, the day Makise Kurisu dies... ...and save her. What would you do?
Rintaro: What!?
UNSPOKEN: Shock ripples through my body. What did she say? Save... Kurisu? But how? We no longer have the PhoneWave or the Time Leap Machine. And even if we did, I could never leap that far back.
Rintaro: Ah...!
UNSPOKEN: Of course. I look over Suzuha's shoulder, at the object disguised as a satellite.
Rintaro: Your time machine... We can use your time machine!
UNSPOKEN: It came all the way from 2036. It should have no trouble going back a mere three weeks. Even better, this time machine can do what Alpha Suzuha's could not. It can travel to the future. I can go to July 28th, save Kurisu, and return to the present. No D-Mails. No time leaps. Genuine physical time travel! I can't refuse. I literally can't refuse. I saw this time machine once before. On July 28th, that fateful day. Shortly before Kurisu was killed, I saw it standing in this very spot, as sure as it is standing before me now. There's only one thing that can mean. It has already been established that this time machine will appear on that day, in this place. Even before I sent the first D-Mail, my participation was assured. Even the thought of turning Suzuha down now is meaningless. Nothing is coincidence. Everything is inevitable. The revelation makes me dizzy. It's like I don't have the tiniest atom of free will, like my every action from the moment of my birth was planned for me by some cosmic force.
Suzuha: The worldline I'm aiming for isn't... what did you call it? The Alpha worldline? It's not that. What we're aiming for... Is the space between attractor fields.
UNSPOKEN: The... space between?
Suzuha: There lies a worldline unaffected by any attractor field. A worldline known as Steins Gate.
Rintaro: Wha...
UNSPOKEN: But that's the chuuni name I pulled out of my ass! It doesn't even mean anything!
Suzuha: I was told that Steins Gate is a brand new worldline, one no one has ever observed.
