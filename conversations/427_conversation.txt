Rintaro: "S-sorry to disappoint you."
Kurisu: "...eh?"
Rintaro: "That wasn’t my first kiss."
Kurisu: "W-why you... You’re just a cherry boy!"
Rintaro: "Shut up, virgin."
UNSPOKEN: I remember playfully kissing Mayuri in elementary school. And just a little while ago, I forcibly kissed Moeka to silence her. But that was on another worldline, and now it never happened, so... I guess it doesn’t count?
Kurisu: "So it wasn’t your first..."
Rintaro: "Right. So it only left a weak impression. Probably not enough to become a long-term memory."
UNSPOKEN: I’m lying, of course. I’ve never felt such an intense kiss as that. The shock was like a lightning bolt to the brain. But still, I’m lying. Because if I miss this opportunity, I’ll never be able to touch Kurisu again. This is my last chance.
Rintaro: "So, once more."
Kurisu: "Wha..."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu fidgets. She usually glares at me harshly, but now she’s avoiding my eyes.
Rintaro: "I don’t ever want to forget... so let’s make doubly sure."
UNSPOKEN: I decide to take the initiative. I wrap my arm gently around Kurisu’s waist and pull her slender body against mine.
Kurisu: "Th-then I guess there’s no choice..."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks up at me shyly.
Kurisu: "Just a kiss... okay?"
UNSPOKEN: What is she worried I’ll do?
Kurisu: "Be gentle... okay?"
UNSPOKEN: I run my fingers softly through her hair. Then I slowly bend down...
Kurisu: "Okabe... Mm..."
UNSPOKEN: We’re both shy, so we end up pecking at each other’s lips like two small birds. Then we draw back and look at each other. Kurisu’s eyes are wet. Tears are running down her cheeks. I kiss them away. They’re salty.
Kurisu: "Don’t forget me..."
UNSPOKEN: We press our lips together again. Stronger than the first time. Longer than the first time. I never want to let go. We embrace each other tightly, our feelings too powerful to contain.
Kurisu: "mm..."
UNSPOKEN: We seek each other’s warmth again and again. Locked in our embrace, we feel each other’s breath. We feel each other’s scent. We feel each other’s taste.
Kurisu: "It’s too fast..."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu’s whisper resonates through our embrace.
Kurisu: "Time is going by too fast. I could really use a word with Einstein right now. Time is not absolute. Einstein proved that time could be fast or slow, depending on the observer. Hey, Okabe. The theory of relativity is so romantic... ...and so sad, don’t you think?"
