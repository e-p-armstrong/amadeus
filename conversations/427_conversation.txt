Suzuha: Nope. It's never been observed. That's what makes it new. But Dad and Uncle Okarin were able to calculate its divergence. -0. 081609% relative to the current worldline. That's where we'll find Steins Gate.
Rintaro: And to reach that worldline, we have to save Kurisu?
Suzuha: Exactly. She's the key to averting World War Three. As long as she lives, the war won't happen. Or at the very least, 5. 7 billion people won't die.
Rintaro: Why?
Suzuha: Huh?
Rintaro: Why Kurisu? I mean, I know she's a genius, but are you telling me she's the hero who'll save 5. 7 billion people?
Suzuha: ...I don't know.
Rintaro: You don't know? And you expect me to go along with this!?
Suzuha: Hey, I'm just following Dad's plan. And apparently, you're the one who came up with it in the first place. If there's a flaw in your plan, then we're all in trouble.
Rintaro: It sounds like you didn't hear it from me. Is that right?
Suzuha: You passed away ten years ago -- 15 years from now, that is. The year 2025.
UNSPOKEN: The same result as on the Alpha worldline.
Suzuha: So I don't know the whole story. What I do know is that my dad continued your work. After you died, he built this time machine all by himself just to see your plan through.
UNSPOKEN: That's my super hacka...
Itaru: ...?
UNSPOKEN: He must have hacked into SERN and stolen their research, then used it to construct his own time machine. On the Alpha worldline, SERN killed Daru before he could complete the machine. But here, Daru was able to perfect his design. That's why it can go back to the future. At least, that seems the most likely explanation.
Suzuha: Uncle Okarin. Like I said, Steins Gate is unobserved. Nobody knows what future awaits us there. There's a chance that a dystopia rises from the ashes of World War Three. There's a chance that Makise Kurisu dies just two days after you save her. There's a chance that you don't die in 2025, but next week. But there's also a chance that when 2036 comes, there will be no dystopia, no world ravaged by war. There's a chance that everyone, including Makise Kurisu, will still be alive. There's a chance that a wonderful future awaits. At least it won't be the future I came from. And it won't be the future the other me came from. That much is certain.
UNSPOKEN: Is an unknown future really for the best? I would hate for the ending roll to say, Despite your best efforts, you made everything worse.
Suzuha: It's completely unknown, completely unpredictable.
