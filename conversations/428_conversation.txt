UNSPOKEN: I look down at Suzuha's hand. Her skin is rough, her palm calloused.  This cool, collected, unsmiling Suzuha comes from a ruined world, from the ashes of a war that claimed over five billion lives. I can only imagine what she's been through. Kurisu... How I have dreamt of saving her. I would do anything -- anything -- to change her fate. But how do I know this invitation won't lead me into another maze of despair?
Mayuri: Um, Mayushii doesn't understand any of this... But this Makise person was very important to you, wasn't she? I think you should go for it!
Itaru: 5. 7 billion people, man. I can't even imagine. But don't sweat the small stuff. Just save the girl, and you're set for life! It's the dream of every otaku!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri and Daru offer me encouragement. But it's not enough to overcome my doubt. The Makise Kurisu we knew -- Lab Member 004 -- is already gone. Even if I save her on this worldline, she won't remember any of the time she shared with us. So there's no point! I won't bend time to my convenience. Not again. I'm not God. I don't have that right. If I try, I'll just end up making things worse! Reason pleads with me to stop. And yet. I look at Suzuha's outstretched hand. And then, with resignation... I grasp it firmly.
Rintaro: I'm in.
UNSPOKEN: Try though I may to fight it, this choice was made for me on July 28th, the moment I laid eyes upon this time machine.
Rintaro: Fate wants me to take your hand. Who am I to argue?
UNSPOKEN: I'm not at all confident that I can save Kurisu. How many times have I tried to resist fate only to fail? I don't want to see her die. But if there is a chance, however small, that she can be saved, I have to try. Even if I can't take back what we had, I want more than anything to save her.
Rintaro: Let's go.
Suzuha: Thank you, Uncle Okarin. Hop aboard!
Rintaro: Can this thing even fit two people?
Suzuha: Of course it can. It's my Dad's masterpiece!
Rintaro: Daru, your daughter really loves you.
Itaru: I don't get it, but stop calling me Dad. I'd rather be your big brother, if you know what I mean.
Mayuri: Be sure to come back, okay? I don't want you to disappear, okay?
Rintaro: I'm not going to another world. It's just a short hop to the past.
