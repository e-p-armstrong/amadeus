Rintaro: "Are you sure I shouldn’t call Mayuri and Daru?"
Kurisu: "...I think that would just make it harder. But you, I have no trouble leaving behind. ...That was a joke."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks like she’s about to cry. I’m sure I look just as sad. But I won’t cry. I don’t have that right.
Rintaro: "This is a souvenir. Take it."
UNSPOKEN: I hand her Future Gadget No. 2: The Bamboo Helicam. It’s a bamboo helicopter equipped with a CCD camera, which allows it to record video in the air. A truly groundbreaking invention. But sadly, due to its constant high-speed rotation, the video it produces tends to cause motion sickness.
Kurisu: "Uh... no thanks."
Rintaro: "Just take it. It’s not even that bulky."
UNSPOKEN: I wanted to give her Future Gadget No. 7: Ghost in the Ball, but it was too big. Kurisu accepts Bamboo Helicam with a strained smile.
Kurisu: "Oh, fine. I guess I’ll take it."
UNSPOKEN: And then, silence. No words of farewell. We just look at each other.
Rintaro: "Sorry I couldn’t go with you to Aomori..."
Kurisu: "Yeah... But these two weeks were fun, in their own way. Give my regards to Mayuri and Hashida, okay?"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu spreads her arms wide. Without a moment’s hesitation, I step forward, and embrace the girl genius one last time.
Kurisu: "Hang in there, Okabe."
Rintaro: "...Stay well."
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu smiles faintly, then turns and walks toward the entrance with suitcase in hand. I watch her go, unable to move a muscle. I want to stop her. I want to wrap my arms around her and tell her to stay with me forever. But I can’t. This is what we decided. To save Mayuri. To save the future. I’m sorry, Kurisu. I can’t save you. Kurisu will disappear. She’ll be left behind on this worldline. There is no place for her in the coming world.
Rintaro: "I... I will remember you, Makise Kurisu. I will remember your warmth. I will never forget!"
UNSPOKEN: I don’t know whether Kurisu hears my words. She keeps walking. Stride steady. Back straight. Long, silky hair fluttering in the wind. She’s quickly fading into the distance. But I can tell. I see her shoulders trembling. We will never meet again. Our worldlines will never cross again. I’m glad I met you, Kurisu. I would have been lost without you. I love you. Goodbye. I stand there in the entrance as commuters file past, until long after she has vanished from sight, afraid that any motion, any thought... Might cause the tears to fall.
Rintaro: "The time has come. We will now commence the final phase of Operation Verthandi."
