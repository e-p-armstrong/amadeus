Rintaro: "The coming world... is the world I wished for!"
UNSPOKEN: I wished for Mayuri to live, and Kurisu to die. That is the truth. And I must never forget it.
Rintaro: "This is the choice of Steins Gate!"
UNSPOKEN: This is the choice of Okabe Rintaro.
Rintaro: "Let the world be reborn!"
UNSPOKEN: I swing down my index finger. And at the exact same time, I hear the lab door open. My eyes dart towards the sound.
Kurisu: "--!"
UNSPOKEN: There, in the doorway, stands Kurisu. Her face is flushed. Was she running? Why is she here? She should be on her way to the airport right now. Kurisu is looking at me. Her eyes are glistening, but her face is all smiles. Did she come back for me? In a split second of frozen time, I imagine I hear her voice. We didn’t say goodbye, she says. Immediately afterward, my finger strikes the enter key. The world starts to warp. The timeline is being rewritten. I feel my consciousness being sucked into the vortex. Reading Steiner. Divergence is changing. The warp accelerates. Kurisu. Daru. Mayuri. Everything inside the lab is shifting. Color fades as my consciousness leaves this worldline. I turn to face Kurisu, desperate to burn this last sight of her into my eyes. She raises her hand.
Kurisu: "Goodbye. Okabe, I lo--"
UNSPOKEN: The world gradually stops spinning. Little by little, color returns. I look to the door. She was standing there just a moment ago. My assistant, Christina... Makise Kurisu. Now she is gone, vanished like a dream. I look around the room. Next to me is Daru. Behind me is Mayuri. Everything is where it should be. It looks like nothing has changed at all. I gently touch my coat’s shoulder, where Kurisu fixed a torn seam. ...It’s gone. My coat isn’t torn. The stitches, uneven from having been sewn in the dark, have disappeared. There’s no trace of that ridiculous pink thread. I stand up and head to the development room. Underneath the table, the Time Leap Machine... No. That’s not the Time Leap Machine. That’s the PhoneWave (name subject to change). The upgrades Kurisu made are gone. Nothing has changed. This world is exactly the same. In all respects save one. Kurisu... was never here. Every trace of her has vanished. Kurisu is nowhere now. Nowhere, except in my memories. Mayuri and Daru are looking at me.
Rintaro: "...Hey, who was Lab Mem 004 again?"
UNSPOKEN: I need to ask. Even though I know what the answer will be.
Mayuri: "Okarin, there isn’t a 4th lab mem, remember?"
Itaru: "Are you going to introduce a new member? Requesting cute girl."
Rintaro: "...No."
