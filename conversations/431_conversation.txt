UNSPOKEN: Mayuri and Daru stare in wonder at my abrupt laughter.
Rintaro: "The last battle of Ragnarok is won! I, the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, with an IQ rivaling that of Einstein himself, have thwarted the Organization, outsmarted SERN-- And conquered the whole of space and time! Now, at the moment of my triumph, I stand before you as a god! This brave new world is the fruit of my ambition! The hated System shall collapse, and chaos shall rule the Earth! This truly is the choice of Steins--"
Mayuri: "Okarin."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri suddenly throws her arms around me. I freeze, utterly taken aback. Daru looks as confused as I am. Mayuri looks up at me and smiles. It’s the gentlest smile I’ve ever seen.
Mayuri: "It’s okay now."
Rintaro: "Wha... what are you saying? I must proclaim our glorious victory, that all may--"
Mayuri: "But Okarin... you look like you’re about to cry."
Rintaro: "...!"
Mayuri: "You don’t have to try so hard, okay? I know you’re doing it for me, but I don’t want to be a burden. So you don’t have to pretend anymore, okay? If you’re hurting, just say so. Like normal Okarin would."
Rintaro: "But... I..."
Mayuri: "You don’t have to worry about Mayushii anymore. Mayushii is fine. So you can cry if you want to, okay? I don’t know what happened... But it’s okay to cry now."
UNSPOKEN: And just like that, the mask shatters. All it took was one word from Mayuri. Mayuri, the sister I never had, the girl who always needed my protection. I had to save her. That was my purpose. I even sacrificed the girl I loved. But now, I finally realize that it’s over. Mayuri is safe. I’m... free. Once more, I see Kurisu’s face in my mind’s eye. I recall the warmth of her body. The softness of her lips. The weight of her last words. One by one, they pound against my heart. I can’t bear it anymore.
Itaru: "Whoa, man. Are you really crying?"
UNSPOKEN: My vision blurs. Tears run down my cheeks.
Rintaro: "I... I..."
