Rintaro: Guh...uh...!
UNSPOKEN: It's getting worse! I look at Suzuha. She has her eyes shut and her jaw clenched tight. I can no longer move. It feels like my back is glued to the wall. My vision begins to warp. And within my warping vision, the powder of light still shifts through the colors of the rainbow. It's strangely beautiful, like something out of a painting. And still I keep falling. Where is it taking me? Through a tunnel in space-time? All I know is that I'm falling. Suddenly, everything goes dark. I try to scream, but even my voice falls away. It doesn't even reach my own ears. It's gravity. There's an intense gravitational distortion behind me. And I'm still falling towards it. My vision slowly recovers. The smell of ozone fills my nostrils. Suzuha takes a deep breath and unfastens her seatbelt.
Suzuha: We're here.
UNSPOKEN: I gulp for air. Did I really just travel through time? If so, then this is July 28th. The day Kurisu and I first met. The day I sent the first D-Mail. The day it all began. Suzuha takes out a digital watch. It's a fairly old-fashioned design.
Suzuha: I bought it in 1975, but it's not even three years old yet.
UNSPOKEN: This is where an uninformed person would say, In Japanese plz. Suzuha sets the watch to the correct time, then hands it to me. The display reads 11:51. Nakabachi's presentation starts at 12.
Suzuha: Let's do this. You keep an eye on Makise Kurisu and stop whoever tries to kill her.
Rintaro: And you?
Suzuha: I'll back you up. Also, remember how I took away your phone? The you of July 28th is here too. Meaning there are currently two Okabe Rintaros in this world. Whatever you do, don't let your past self see you. It could cause a major time paradox.
Rintaro: But Titor said that couldn't happen.
Suzuha: That was a lie. Misinformation.
UNSPOKEN: Come to think of it, Alpha Suzuha said the stuff she posted about the many-worlds interpretation was fake too.
Rintaro: Got it.
Suzuha: Then let's go. We'll rendezvous at the time machine when it's over!
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha finishes her rushed explanation and motions me toward the hatch. I open the hatch and grab the rim. I squeeze my way out. Suzuha crawls out after me and closes the hatch.
Suzuha: You hide! I'll provide a distraction.
