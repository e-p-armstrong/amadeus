Rintaro: !?
UNSPOKEN: That voice... I turn around.
Rintaro: Kurisu...!
Kurisu: Um, do I know you?
Rintaro: No...
Kurisu: You came down from the roof just now, didn't you?
UNSPOKEN: She looks at me with those beautiful eyes, eyes shining with intelligence and strength of will. I thought I would never see her again. But now. Now, before my very eyes, is the girl I love. Tears well up in my eyes. I want to embrace her right this instant. It takes everything I have to resist the urge. Don't forget. This is our first meeting. This Kurisu doesn't know me.
Kurisu: I heard a strange sound from the roof. Is that why the building shook just now? What's going on? It's not Doctor Nakabachi's doing, is it?
UNSPOKEN: Why did I have to run into Kurisu, of all people? I can't answer. I'm afraid that if I speak, I'll be unable to contain my emotions. The memory of her last smile is burned into my mind, imploring me to act.
Kurisu: Are you listening? You're sweating like crazy.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks at me with suspicion. What would happen if I were to grab Kurisu and run?  Would divergence change? Would her murder be averted? I recall all the times Mayuri died. I recall all the times I time leaped to save her. Everything I tried ended in vain. I was unable to save her even once. No matter what I did, the world itself killed her. Won't it be the same with Kurisu? Should I even try? I reach towards Kurisu, my hand shaking.
Kurisu: Hey!
UNSPOKEN: She steps back in surprise and fear, clutching a manila envelope to her chest. This is our first meeting. I know that. But to me, she's still the girl I love.  If I'd been thinking straight a second ago, I would have realized that my plan to grab her and flee wasn't going to work. Kurisu would never follow some strange man she only just met. Running isn't an option. All I can do is wait at the scene of the crime. Fighting against the urge to stay, I force myself to turn and leave.
Kurisu: Please answer my question!
UNSPOKEN: But Kurisu pursues me. Why is she so desperate to know who I am? I do look suspicious. I'll admit that. But if she thinks I'm dangerous, why would she come alone? I turn around reluctantly and meet Kurisu's stare.
Kurisu: ...Answer me.
Rintaro: Can I--
UNSPOKEN: The words catch in my throat. Can I save her? I don't know. All I know is that convergence is merciless and cruel, and that I am powerless to stop it.
Kurisu: Can you... what?
UNSPOKEN: I shake my head, then bolt for the stairs before Kurisu can react.
Kurisu: W-wait! Stop!
UNSPOKEN: When I make it back to the 8th floor, the presentation has already started. I peek in through the door of the assembly hall.
Rintaro: Who the hell am I!? Someone who knows you for a fraud, that's who!
