Suzuha: "...Okabe Rintaro?"
Rintaro: "Suzuha!"
UNSPOKEN: It really is her. The part-time warrior. John Titor. Time traveler from 2036. Daru’s daughter, who will be born 7 years from now.
Rintaro: "Why are you here!?"
UNSPOKEN: I asked her the same question over the phone, but I can’t help myself. I need answers.
Suzuha: "Are you Okabe Rintaro? I need to know."
Rintaro: "Y-yeah..."
UNSPOKEN: The way she puts it makes it sound like she’s never met me before. And now that we’re talking face to face, I realize that there’s something very different about her. For starters, what’s with all the camo? It looks dirty and worn, like she’s been fighting in it for a while. She’s even carrying a gun, for some reason, and I’m pretty sure it’s not a replica. Is she really Amane Suzuha?
Rintaro: "Hold on. Just hold on one second."
UNSPOKEN: This doesn’t make sense! No, calm down. Figure this out, Okabe. You know that this is impossible. Suzuha can’t be here. She leapt to 1975 in her one-way time machine. She found the IBN 5100, made sure it would get to you, then passed away in the year 2000. So where did this girl come from?
Suzuha: "I’m a time traveler from the year 2036. I have a request for Uncle Okarin."
UNSPOKEN: U-Uncle!?
Mayuri: "You’re an uncle?"
UNSPOKEN: We don’t have time to humor Mayuri’s question. Suzuha walks up to me and looks me in the eye. Her expression is grim. The next words out of her mouth are the last thing I expected to hear.
Suzuha: "This worldline is headed for World War Three! I need your help to prevent it! Please, help me change the future!"
Rintaro: "Wha... what the... What the hell are you talking about!?"
Mayuri: "World War Three? Oh no! That’s really bad!"
Itaru: "Uh, are you really a time traveler? You’re not just messing with us here?"
Suzuha: "Stay out of this, Dad."
Itaru: "D-Dad!? W-whoa... that was a shock. I mean, it’s not every day a mysterious beauty calls me dad. Though to be honest, I’d prefer to be called big brother."
Rintaro: "Wait! Everyone just wait! Let me think!"
UNSPOKEN: I take a deep breath. Okay... let’s figure this out. I turn to Suzuha.
Rintaro: "Is that thing a time machine?"
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha nods curtly. She hasn’t smiled once. There’s no hint of the cheerful Suzuha I remember. Instead, I sense strength, conviction, and steel resolve.
Rintaro: "Your father built it?"
Suzuha: "That’s right."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha glances at Daru.
Rintaro: "Where did you come from?"
Suzuha: "The year 2036. I stopped in 1975 and 2000 first."
Rintaro: "You... what?"
