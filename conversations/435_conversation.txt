UNSPOKEN: I can’t go back. Not to the worldline where Mayuri dies.
Rintaro: "I don’t care if 5. 7 billion people die! I won’t let her... I won’t let Kurisu’s sacrifice be in vain!"
UNSPOKEN: One person versus 5. 7 billion. They can’t be compared. Suzuha is staring at me in disbelief. Mayuri and Daru clearly don’t know what to say. I haven’t told them what happened, so they can’t understand.
Suzuha: "Wait. You mean you’ve been to another attractor field? Wow. So that’s the power of Reading Steiner."
Rintaro: "...How do you know about that?"
Suzuha: "Dad told me. And I’ve met you before, Uncle Okarin. In the future, that is."
Rintaro: "You’ve... met me?"
Suzuha: "I see... so the me of that attractor field went to the past too..."
UNSPOKEN: A faint smile flickers across her face, then she looks at me with renewed intensity.
Suzuha: "Uncle Okarin. I know you don’t want to, but--"
Rintaro: "No. I won’t let Kurisu’s death be in vain. I won’t let Mayuri die."
Mayuri: "Huh? Mayushii dies?"
Suzuha: "By Kurisu, I assume you mean Makise Kurisu? Listen, Uncle. Let’s say -- hypothetically -- that the only way to change the future of this worldline is to go to July 28th, 2010, the day Makise Kurisu dies... ...and save her. What would you do?"
Rintaro: "What!?"
UNSPOKEN: Shock ripples through my body. What did she say? Save... Kurisu? But how? We no longer have the PhoneWave or the Time Leap Machine. And even if we did, I could never leap that far back.
Rintaro: "Ah...!"
UNSPOKEN: Of course. I look over Suzuha’s shoulder, at the object disguised as a satellite.
Rintaro: "Your time machine... We can use your time machine!"
