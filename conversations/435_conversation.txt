Kurisu: You're... stealing it, Papa?
Nakabachi: ...What did you say?
Kurisu: You're stealing my work? I didn't think even you would do something like-- Ah!
UNSPOKEN: Nakabachi suddenly whirls and strikes Kurisu across the face. What do I do!? I know I should do something, but what!?
Nakabachi: Who do you think you're talking to!?
UNSPOKEN: Nakabachi throws the paper aside and seizes his daughter by the throat. Kurisu gasps for air. Her face twists in pain as his grip tightens.
Kurisu: Ah, guh...
Nakabachi: You can't possibly understand how I feel! Why did you have to be so talented!? I detest you! I hate your very existence! Nobody is allowed to be better than me! Understand!? Nobody! Especially not my own daughter! That's why I sent you away! I couldn't bear the shame of being your father! It's all your fault! It's all your fault!
UNSPOKEN: This is completely absurd! He's blaming her for his own failures! I've seen enough. He's the killer for sure. I burst from my hiding spot.
Rintaro: Stop!
Nakabachi: ...!?
UNSPOKEN: I ram him with my shoulder as hard as I can, knocking him away from Kurisu. Kurisu gasps for breath.
Kurisu: Guh, gah hoh gah hoh gah hoh...
Nakabachi: Who the hell are you!?
Rintaro: I won't let you kill Kurisu!
