Kurisu: I'm... sorry...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu speaks. Her voice is barely a whisper. I feel something wet on my hands. Wet... and warm. Blood. Kurisu's blood. Gushing from her wound. It's warm, but not hot. And yet, it feels like it's burning my hands. I try to pull the knife out. If I can stop the bleeding, maybe she'll be okay. But my hands won't move. It's like they've turned to stone. My arms. My fingers. No matter how hard I try, they won't move an inch.
Kurisu: Haah... haah...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's breathing quickly grows labored. She's suffering. I didn't mean for this to happen. This isn't what I wanted! Why won't my hands move? I want to pull out the knife. I want to ease her pain. Why won't my body obey me!? It's as if someone else is in control. Kurisu's body convulses against mine. The pain must be unbearable. Is there nothing I can do to help her!? I want to cry.
Rintaro: Why...
UNSPOKEN: The only thing I can do... is ask.
Kurisu: Because... he's still... my father. I just... wanted him... to accept me... I studied... so hard... hoping he would... praise me... But now... I finally... understand... Papa... didn't want... to accept me... I'm such... an idiot... Why... did I save him... I wonder... I'm... sorry... for getting you... involved... Ugh... it hurts... Am I... going to die? I don't want to die... I don't want it... to end... like this...
UNSPOKEN: Her voice is fading fast. Don't die. Please don't die on me! But my prayers are in vain.
Kurisu: Help... me... He...lp...
UNSPOKEN: Her body suddenly grows heavy. I can no longer hear the sound of her breathing. And yet, the blood from her wound is still warm. I killed her. I killed her. The one who killed Kurisu... Was me.
Rintaro: Ah... ah... AHHHHHHHHHHH!
UNSPOKEN: As I scream, another me looks down from above. As he hears the sound of my despair, the last piece of the puzzle clicks into place. The scream I heard that day... was my own.
Suzuha: Uncle Okarin!
UNSPOKEN: Someone pulls at my arm.
Suzuha: Come on! Get up!
UNSPOKEN: I feel hands slip under my shoulders and drag me away. The knife in my hands pulls free of Kurisu's chest. A fresh torrent of blood follows it. Still warm.
Rintaro: Open your eyes, Kurisu... Wake up...
Suzuha: Pull yourself together! We need to get out of here before they find us!
Rintaro: I'm sorry... I didn't mean to kill you... I tried to save you... I did... Why is this happening...
