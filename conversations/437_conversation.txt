Itaru: Whoa, you're covered in blood! What happened!?
Suzuha: Get him a towel, Dad! And water! And some clothes, too! Hurry!
Itaru: Eh? Eh? An explanation, por favor!
Suzuha: Just go already!
Itaru: O-okay!
UNSPOKEN: Daru runs back inside the building.
Mayuri: Are you okay? Hang in there... don't die...
Suzuha: He's okay. It's not his blood.
UNSPOKEN: Leave me alone. I don't deserve your concern. Save Kurisu? What a joke. Not only did I fail to save her. I took her life with my own two hands. Three weeks ago, in this very spot. I killed her. I murdered her.
Rintaro: There's no way to save her... there never was... Hahaha... Everything has already been decided... It's the same as it was with Mayuri. The same... No matter how hard I struggle... the result will always be the same...
UNSPOKEN: We have a time machine. Shouldn't we give it another try? No. It's not that simple. No matter how many times I try, the result will converge on Kurisu's death. Even if I throw the knife away, fate will find some other way to kill Kurisu. Maybe Nakabachi will kill her. Maybe I'll trip and push her down the stairs. Maybe she'll just drop dead for no reason. The cause doesn't matter. The effect will always be the same. It doesn't matter if I time leap, or if I time travel. Going to the past can't change the result. Maybe a D-Mail could shift divergence enough to take us to another attractor field, but there's no way to control what might happen. D-Mail is a shot in the dark. It's useless. Useless. Everything is useless.
Rintaro: There's nothing I can do... nothing... nothing... I can't save Kurisu after all... ha, haha, hahaha... I knew this would happen... I knew it would turn out like this... I can't take this any more... I'm so tired... enough already... I give up... Haha, ha...
Mayuri: Okarin!
UNSPOKEN: A burning numbness spreads through my cheek. Mayuri hit me.
Rintaro: Wha...
UNSPOKEN: She's never done anything like this before. The shock is enough to bring me to my senses. Mayuri looks at me with tears streaming down her cheeks. Her small body gently embraces mine, though I'm still covered in Kurisu's blood.
Mayuri: Okarin... you're not a quitter. Mayushii knows. You never, ever give up. Not until the very end. Remember? Every day, Mayushii prayed for help in front of Granny's grave. And every day, you came to see me. Even on rainy days and snowy days, you always stood next to Mayushii and called my name. Because you were always there for Mayushii... I was finally able to say goodbye to Granny. Mayushii doesn't really understand what's going on, but don't give up now. Okay? Mayushii doesn't want to see you sad.
