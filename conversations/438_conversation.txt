Suzuha: "Give me your phone."
UNSPOKEN: When I hand it over, Suzuha casually tosses it out the hatch.
Rintaro: "Hey!"
Suzuha: "It’s better not to bring it. It’ll cause interference."
UNSPOKEN: Interference? Oh, I see. We’re going to July 28th. So there’ll be two of me, and if I bring it, two of my phone. I guess that could be a problem if I got a call or something. So time travelers really do need to be careful about what they bring to the past.
Suzuha: "Shut the hatch."
UNSPOKEN: I hear Mayuri and Daru cheering outside. Mayuri caught my phone, thankfully. I give them a final nod, then close the hatch. Silence engulfs us. Suzuha is operating the time display panel. She sets our destination. July 28, 2010. 11:50 AM.
Suzuha: "That should do it."
Rintaro: "That’s cutting it awfully close."
UNSPOKEN: I remember that Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation began at 12.
Suzuha: "This time machine can’t physically move."
Rintaro: "Meaning?"
Suzuha: "No matter what time we travel to, we’ll always arrive at the exact same coordinates. In other words, on the roof of Radi-Kan. I mean, it’s a little more complicated than that, but there’s no time to explain. Anyway, we could leap to the day before the presentation. But if we attract too much attention, they could close Radi-Kan and cancel the presentation. That’s why we’ve gotta cut it close."
Rintaro: "I see..."
Suzuha: "Uncle, this is your first time time traveling, right?"
Rintaro: "Okay, first, stop calling me Uncle. And yes. I’ve made more time leaps than I want to remember, but I’ve never time traveled before. According to John Titor, the G-forces are pretty strong. You feel like you’re being stretched out."
Suzuha: "Yeah, I wrote that."
Rintaro: "The John Titor stuff?"
Suzuha: "Right. Back when I leapt to 2000."
Rintaro: "I see..."
UNSPOKEN: The past has changed -- changed back, I suppose, from my point of view. When I was on the Alpha worldline, I saw Titor post on @channel in real time. On this worldline, those posts were made to an English BBS in the year 2000.
Suzuha: "You don’t sound surprised."
UNSPOKEN: Nothing can surprise me now. My brain’s too busy trying to process all this new information. It feels like it’s gonna blow. 
Suzuha: "I’ll go over the mission one more time. Once we arrive, there’ll be no time for chitchat. The objective is to prevent Makise Kurisu’s death."
