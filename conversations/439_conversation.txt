Suzuha: "That day’s a turning point, remember? Meaning the probability of Makise Kurisu’s death is roughly 50%."
Rintaro: "So convergence won’t happen?"
Suzuha: "It may happen, it may not. No, it probably will. But I’m sure there’s a loophole somewhere. That loophole is the doorway to Steins Gate."
UNSPOKEN: So in the end, it’s a gamble.
Suzuha: "Oh, one more thing. Watch out for Doctor Nakabachi."
Rintaro: "What do you mean?"
Suzuha: "Remember what I said about World War Three? It all started because of something called the Nakabachi Paper, a paper Doctor Nakabachi wrote detailing his theory of time travel."
Rintaro: "But that fraud’s theory was just a ripoff of John Titor’s."
UNSPOKEN: Wait a minute... John Titor’s sitting right in front of me.
Rintaro: "So what Titor posted on the internet was true?"
Suzuha: "I mixed in some lies, so not many people listened to me at the time. I never thought someone would reevaluate it ten years later. Looks like he built his theory off what I wrote. Apparently, it’s almost perfect. Anyway, Doctor Nakabachi was there when Makise Kurisu was killed, right? So watch out for him. I’m sure he’s important to the divergence of this worldline."
UNSPOKEN: Doctor Nakabachi? Important? I thought he was just some con artist.
Suzuha: "Ready to go? Fasten your seatbelt."
UNSPOKEN: I look underneath my butt to find what looks like a car seatbelt. I wrap it around my waist and fix my body to the seat.
Rintaro: "Does it shake a lot?"
Suzuha: "Shake? No, it doesn’t shake."
UNSPOKEN: You mean it does something else? Wait, is this safe!? Suzuha leans forward and pushes a bright yellow button on the bottom of the panel. There are no windows, so I can’t tell if the time machine is moving.
Suzuha: "It’s only three weeks, so it shouldn’t take more than two or three minutes."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha fastens her own seatbelt and sighs.
Suzuha: "When I first leapt to 1975, it was six long hours with nothing to do."
UNSPOKEN: I guess time travelers have their own problems.
Suzuha: "Since it’s only a few minutes, we won’t bother with the oxygen masks. Just be aware we’ll have no oxygen for the duration."
Rintaro: "You mean I have to hold my breath!?"
Suzuha: "Right here..."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha points to the center of the cylinder -- the space between me and her.
Suzuha: "There’ll be an air pocket. Stick your head inside, and you’ll have enough oxygen for about ten minutes."
Rintaro: "Hey. For argument’s sake... what happens if we fail to save Kurisu?"
Suzuha: "There’s not much fuel left. We barely had enough to begin with. There’s not even enough for a return trip to 2036. So if we fail to change the worldline, then I’ll be stuck in this time. But don’t worry. As long as we’re just traveling three weeks each way, we still have enough for two round trips."
