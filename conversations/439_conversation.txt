UNSPOKEN: The person most precious to me, who I wanted so desperately to save.
Rintaro: I... killed her!
Mayuri: Okarin...
UNSPOKEN: I can still feel the knife in my hand. I can still feel her fading heartbeat. I look at my hands over Mayuri's shoulder. They're red with blood. Kurisu's blood. The shaking won't stop. Tears fall, washing away the blood. Guilt and despair are tearing my soul. If Suzuha hadn't taken the knife, I might have slit my own throat in that very spot. This reality is too much to bear. But I realize that this is retribution, my just punishment for taking the godlike power of time travel and using it to distort the past. Kurisu can't be saved. That has been proven beyond a doubt. At the very least, I can't save her. Not even with Mayuri's encouragement.
Rintaro: There's nothing I can do...
Suzuha: You're wrong.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha speaks, her voice full of conviction. And immediately afterwards-- I hear a familiar melody. My mail tone. Mayuri takes my phone out of her pocket. She's been looking after it.
Mayuri: You've got mail, Okarin...
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri gently puts my phone into my hand. I don't have the energy to check my mail. But for some reason, Suzuha gestures for me to look at it. I reluctantly open my inbox. What? Turn on the TV? That's all it says. The sender is unfamiliar. Is this a prank? Spam? I'm bewildered. I don't know who sent this. But then I happen to glance at the send time, and the shock is like a lightning bolt to the brain. The date it was sent...
Rintaro: 2025...
UNSPOKEN: No... Is this... It doesn't even occur to me to wonder if my phone has malfunctioned. After all, I know this phenomenon.
Rintaro: A D-Mail!?
UNSPOKEN: I look up at Suzuha. She sees my confusion and looks at my phone.
Suzuha: It actually came through! Just like he said it would!
UNSPOKEN: Judging by her surprise, I guess she doesn't know much. Suzuha leapt from 2036. That's 11 years after this D-Mail was sent. Does that mean it's not related to her?
Mayuri: What does it mean?
Suzuha: There must be something on. Something you need to see!
Itaru: Hey, guys! I brought the stuff!
