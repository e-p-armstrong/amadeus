Suzuha: "I don’t. Once we reach Steins Gate, I won’t have any reason to come to this time in the first place, will I? Causality will be reconstructed. I should disappear from this time, since I’ll probably be living peacefully in 2036. But that all depends on you, Uncle Okarin."
UNSPOKEN: Her tone is light, but her expression is serious. This is the first time in weeks that we’ve spoken, but I just now realized something about her.  Suzuha is pretty reckless, isn’t she? Suddenly, there’s a zapping sound, and countless faint silver lights start floating around the cylinder. They look like moth dust. Or powdered snow. The lights slowly change colors. Violet. Blue. Green. Yellow, orange, and red. Back to silver. Violet. Blue... The colors of the rainbow? I feel pressure on my entire body, similar to the sensation you feel as you ascend in an elevator. In an elevator, you feel as if you’re being pulled downwards. But instead, the time machine feels like it’s pulling at my back. The feeling of pressure quickly increases. It starts to feel like I’m falling horizontally. I’ve never experienced anything like this. It’s so uncomfortable, I want to scream. The strangest thing is that the time machine itself isn’t shaking. In fact, it doesn’t seem to be moving at all. There’s no noise. No vibration. It’s eerie. The pulling sensation grows even stronger. I can hear my bones creaking. I imagine my body flattened like a pancake. It’s not a pleasant thought.
Rintaro: "Guh...uh...!"
UNSPOKEN: It’s getting worse! I look at Suzuha. She has her eyes shut and her jaw clenched tight. I can no longer move. It feels like my back is glued to the wall. My vision begins to warp. And within my warping vision, the powder of light still shifts through the colors of the rainbow. It’s strangely beautiful, like something out of a painting. And still I keep falling. Where is it taking me? Through a tunnel in space-time? All I know is that I’m falling. Suddenly, everything goes dark. I try to scream, but even my voice falls away. It doesn’t even reach my own ears. It’s gravity. There’s an intense gravitational distortion behind me. And I’m still falling towards it. My vision slowly recovers. The smell of ozone fills my nostrils. Suzuha takes a deep breath and unfastens her seatbelt.
Suzuha: "We’re here."
UNSPOKEN: I gulp for air. Did I really just travel through time? If so, then this is July 28th. The day Kurisu and I first met. The day I sent the first D-Mail. The day it all began. Suzuha takes out a digital watch. It’s a fairly old-fashioned design.
Suzuha: "I bought it in 1975, but it’s not even three years old yet."
