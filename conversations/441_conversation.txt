Suzuha: "Let’s do this. You keep an eye on Makise Kurisu and stop whoever tries to kill her."
Rintaro: "And you?"
Suzuha: "I’ll back you up. Also, remember how I took away your phone? The you of July 28th is here too. Meaning there are currently two Okabe Rintaros in this world. Whatever you do, don’t let your past self see you. It could cause a major time paradox."
Rintaro: "But Titor said that couldn’t happen."
Suzuha: "That was a lie. Misinformation."
UNSPOKEN: Come to think of it, Alpha Suzuha said the stuff she posted about the many-worlds interpretation was fake too.
Rintaro: "Got it."
Suzuha: "Then let’s go. We’ll rendezvous at the time machine when it’s over!"
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha finishes her rushed explanation and motions me toward the hatch. I open the hatch and grab the rim. I squeeze my way out. Suzuha crawls out after me and closes the hatch.
Suzuha: "You hide! I’ll provide a distraction."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha runs up to the emergency door. And then, to my astonishment, she draws her gun and fires at the doorknob. The door opens easily. That must have broken the lock. Any minute now, a crowd of people will run up these stairs to see what happened. My past self will be among them. I need to hide before they get here! That was a close one. I nearly bumped into myself on the 8th floor landing. Right after I ran downstairs to the 7th floor, I heard footsteps running the other way behind me. Those footsteps were mine, no doubt. It was a near miss. To be safe, I descend to the 4th floor before stopping to take a breath. I take a look around, but there’s nobody paying attention to me. I wonder what Suzuha is doing. I’m worried, but I need to focus on my own mission. I must prevent Kurisu’s death. In about 30 minutes from now, just after Nakabachi’s presentation ends, someone will murder her. I know where it happens. In the 8th floor hallway, towards the back of the building, where people rarely go. What I don’t know is who stabbed her. Instead of running around and drawing attention to myself, I should just wait at the scene. Let’s cool off here for about five minutes, and then head over there. If I remember correctly, Kurisu tried to talk to me in the assembly hall, but I blew her off and came down here. After that, I tried calling Mayuri, but her phone was off and I couldn’t get through, so I went back up to the assembly hall to find her.  What time was that? I search my memories, trying to plot the actions I took on July 28th. It sounded simple when Suzuha said it, but staying away from my past self is going to take more work than I thought. Frustration mounts. I shove Suzuha’s watch into my pocket to quash it. Just then--
Kurisu: "Excuse me."
Rintaro: "!?"
