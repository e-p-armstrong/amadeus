Kurisu: You're... stealing it?
Nakabachi: ...What did you say?
Kurisu: You're stealing my work? I didn't think even you would do something like-- Ah!
UNSPOKEN: Nakabachi strikes Kurisu on the cheek.
Nakabachi: Who do you think you're talking to!?
UNSPOKEN: It's starting! Nakabachi puts his hands around Kurisu's neck. Her cries of agony fill my ears. There's still a way to prevent Kurisu's death. That puddle of blood I saw beneath Kurisu's body. There's one more way to reproduce it. One more way. One last chance. It's a gamble, to be sure. Even if it succeeds, I don't know what effect it might have on the Steins Gate worldline.
Kurisu: Ah, uuh...
Nakabachi: You can't possibly understand how I feel! Why did you have to be so talented!? I detest you! I hate your very existence! Nobody is allowed to be better than me! Understand!? Nobody! Especially not my own daughter! That's why I abandoned you! I couldn't bear the shame of being your father! It's all your fault... it's all your fault!
UNSPOKEN: It matters not. I am Hououin Kyouma, the mad scientist who defies God. My true desire is chaos. I have no need for a predetermined future!
Rintaro: Stop!
UNSPOKEN: Calmly, I step out from my hiding spot. Nakabachi looks at me in disbelief. His eyes are wide and bloodshot.
Nakabachi: You! You're the brat who ruined my presentation!
UNSPOKEN: Nakabachi lets go of Kurisu.
Kurisu: Guh, gah hoh gah hoh gah hoh...
Nakabachi: How dare you show your face before me!? Why does everyone get in my way!? I know! You and Kurisu planned this, didn't you? Didn't you!? You brats won't get away with this!
UNSPOKEN: Nakabachi pulls the knife from his pocket. Its blade reflects cold light. Once I see that glint, I laugh disdainfully.
Rintaro: Try it, if you dare.
Nakabachi: You... who are you!?
Rintaro: My name... Is Hououin Kyouma!
Nakabachi: What!?
Rintaro: 'Houou' for 'phoenix', then 'in', and finally the 'terrible truth' that must never be revealed! Hououin Kyouma! I am the Bringer of Chaos. The Destroyer of Order. And I am the one who will end your ambition!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu staggers to her feet with her hand to her neck.
Kurisu: Run away!
Rintaro: Never!
UNSPOKEN: I dismiss Kurisu's plea, and instead turn to Nakabachi with my arms spread wide.
Rintaro: What's wrong, Doctor Nakabachi? Aren't you going to kill me? Or have you lost your nerve? Of course, a mere mortal can never slay a god such as I! Muhahaha!
Nakabachi: You little...!
UNSPOKEN: Nakabachi goes into a frenzy. He charges me with his knife point-first.
Kurisu: No! Papa, stop!
