Rintaro: "I’m sorry... I didn’t mean to kill you... I tried to save you... I did... Why is this happening..."
UNSPOKEN: Someone puts my arm over their shoulder and hauls me to my feet, then drags me away step by step. I don’t have the strength to resist. Guilt and regret are the only things inside of me. I killed Kurisu... twice.
Suzuha: "Hup! Phew... let’s get outta here... Don’t give up yet, Uncle. Everything’s gonna be fine. I promise! Now hold on tight!"
UNSPOKEN: I feel someone push me hard from behind. Next, they take the knife away. My fingers are like solid rock. They have to be pried open one by one. I failed to save Kurisu. Worse... convergence made me kill her. The past has already been decided. It was impossible to change it from the start. Someone drags me out of the time machine. I crumple on the spot, powerless to even stand.
Itaru: "Woah, you’re already back! It hasn’t even been a minute."
Mayuri: "...Okarin? Okarin!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri rushes over to me. She looks at my face in concern. But even her concern is too much for me to bear. Please, don’t talk to me. Just leave me alone.
Itaru: "Whoa, you’re covered in blood! What happened!?"
Suzuha: "Get him a towel, Dad! And water! And some clothes, too! Hurry!"
Itaru: "Eh? Eh? An explanation, por favor!"
Suzuha: "Just go already!"
Itaru: "O-okay!"
UNSPOKEN: Daru runs back inside the building.
Mayuri: "Are you okay? Hang in there... don’t die..."
Suzuha: "He’s okay. It’s not his blood."
UNSPOKEN: Leave me alone. I don’t deserve your concern. Save Kurisu? What a joke. Not only did I fail to save her. I took her life with my own two hands. Three weeks ago, in this very spot. I killed her. I murdered her.
Rintaro: "There’s no way to save her... there never was... Hahaha... Everything has already been decided... It’s the same as it was with Mayuri. The same... No matter how hard I struggle... the result will always be the same..."
UNSPOKEN: We have a time machine. Shouldn’t we give it another try? No. It’s not that simple. No matter how many times I try, the result will converge on Kurisu’s death. Even if I throw the knife away, fate will find some other way to kill Kurisu. Maybe Nakabachi will kill her. Maybe I’ll trip and push her down the stairs. Maybe she’ll just drop dead for no reason. The cause doesn’t matter. The effect will always be the same. It doesn’t matter if I time leap, or if I time travel. Going to the past can’t change the result. Maybe a D-Mail could shift divergence enough to take us to another attractor field, but there’s no way to control what might happen. D-Mail is a shot in the dark. It’s useless. Useless. Everything is useless.
Rintaro: "There’s nothing I can do... nothing... nothing... I can’t save Kurisu after all... ha, haha, hahaha... I knew this would happen... I knew it would turn out like this... I can’t take this any more... I’m so tired... enough already... I give up... Haha, ha..."
