UNSPOKEN: A burning numbness spreads through my cheek. Mayuri hit me.
Rintaro: "Wha..."
UNSPOKEN: She’s never done anything like this before. The shock is enough to bring me to my senses. Mayuri looks at me with tears streaming down her cheeks. Her small body gently embraces mine, though I’m still covered in Kurisu’s blood.
Mayuri: "Okarin... you’re not a quitter. Mayushii knows. You never, ever give up. Not until the very end. Remember? Every day, Mayushii prayed for help in front of Granny’s grave. And every day, you came to see me. Even on rainy days and snowy days, you always stood next to Mayushii and called my name. Because you were always there for Mayushii... I was finally able to say goodbye to Granny. Mayushii doesn’t really understand what’s going on, but don’t give up now. Okay? Mayushii doesn’t want to see you sad."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri’s gentle warmth envelops me. I cling to that warmth, but it’s not enough to heal my heart.
Rintaro: "But... I killed her."
UNSPOKEN: The person most precious to me, who I wanted so desperately to save.
Rintaro: "I... killed her!"
Mayuri: "Okarin..."
UNSPOKEN: I can still feel the knife in my hand. I can still feel her fading heartbeat. I look at my hands over Mayuri’s shoulder. They’re red with blood. Kurisu’s blood. The shaking won’t stop. Tears fall, washing away the blood. Guilt and despair are tearing my soul. If Suzuha hadn’t taken the knife, I might have slit my own throat in that very spot. This reality is too much to bear. But I realize that this is retribution, my just punishment for taking the godlike power of time travel and using it to distort the past. Kurisu can’t be saved. That has been proven beyond a doubt. At the very least, I can’t save her. Not even with Mayuri’s encouragement.
Rintaro: "There’s nothing I can do..."
Suzuha: "You’re wrong."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha speaks, her voice full of conviction. And immediately afterwards-- I hear a familiar melody. My mail tone. Mayuri takes my phone out of her pocket. She’s been looking after it.
Mayuri: "You’ve got mail, Okarin..."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri gently puts my phone into my hand. I don’t have the energy to check my mail. But for some reason, Suzuha gestures for me to look at it. I reluctantly open my inbox. What? Turn on the TV? That’s all it says. The sender is unfamiliar. Is this a prank? Spam? I’m bewildered. I don’t know who sent this. But then I happen to glance at the send time, and the shock is like a lightning bolt to the brain. The date it was sent...
Rintaro: "2025..."
