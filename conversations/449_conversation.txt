UNSPOKEN: I look up at Suzuha. She sees my confusion and looks at my phone.
Suzuha: "It actually came through! Just like he said it would!"
UNSPOKEN: Judging by her surprise, I guess she doesn’t know much. Suzuha leapt from 2036. That’s 11 years after this D-Mail was sent. Does that mean it’s not related to her?
Mayuri: "What does it mean?"
Suzuha: "There must be something on. Something you need to see!"
Itaru: "Hey, guys! I brought the stuff!"
UNSPOKEN: Daru comes back with a convenience store bag. Right on time. Fortunately, my phone has TV reception. As soon as I switch it on, I see a news reporter standing in some foreign airport. There’s a jumbo jet in the background. Looking closer, I see burns near the plane’s tail. The caption says Fire on Russian Airlines.
Female Reporter: "Russian authorities announced today that a fire broke out on Russian Airlines Flight 801, en route from Narita to Moscow. The flight departed Narita Airport at 11:05 Japan time, but a fire broke out in the cargo hold shortly before arrival. The flight made an emergency landing at Domodedovo International Airport, where the passengers were evacuated. No one was injured. One of the passengers on Flight 801 was a Japanese physicist who had declared his intention to seek asylum in Russia."
UNSPOKEN: The screen changes, and the camera cuts to what appears to be the airport lobby. A man is standing there, surrounded by reporters. When I see his face, my breath catches in my throat.
Rintaro: "Doctor Nakabachi!"
