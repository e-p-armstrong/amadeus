UNSPOKEN: Sitting in the palm of his hand is a lump of silvery metal barely five centimeters tall.
Mayuri: "AHHH!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri points at the screen. I look closer. That lump of metal in Nakabachi’s hand. It’s not just any lump of metal.
Mayuri: "That’s my Metal Upa! Look! See there? It has Mayushii’s name on it!"
UNSPOKEN: Upa is a mascot character from the popular card game RaiNet Access Battlers. You can see Upa merchandise everywhere in Akihabara, from capsule toys to phone straps and other accessories. But of all Upa merchandise, the most rare is the Metal Upa. The very same Metal Upa that Nakabachi is presenting to the camera. Near the bottom of the Metal Upa, I can see cute letters written in bright red magic marker. The letters read... Mayushii’s!
Itaru: "Whoa, you’re right! What’s he doing with it?"
Mayuri: "I dropped it during the presentation! I looked everywhere, but couldn’t find it. So that’s where it went! I can’t get it back if it’s all the way in Russia..."
UNSPOKEN: I stare at the screen in disbelief. My body is shaking. Goosebumps break out over every inch of flesh. I know what this is.
Rintaro: "The Butterfly Effect!"
UNSPOKEN: Three weeks ago, Mayuri dropped her Metal Upa in the assembly hall of Radi-Kan. That tiny figure, a mere child’s toy, went on to decide the fate of mankind. It rescued the Nakabachi Paper from the fire. And in so doing, it laid the foundation for World War Three.
Rintaro: "Suzuha... did you know about this?"
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha answers with a look of apology.
Rintaro: "Who sent that D-Mail from 2025?"
UNSPOKEN: Whoever it was clearly meant for us to see the news about Doctor Nakabachi.
Suzuha: "Sorry."
UNSPOKEN: Sorry? About what? What is she apologizing for?
Suzuha: "Sorry for not telling you everything. But we needed you to fail once. You had to experience Makise Kurisu’s death firsthand."
UNSPOKEN: What?
Rintaro: "You... tricked me?"
Suzuha: "Not exactly. It was part of the plan. At least, that’s what I was told."
UNSPOKEN: Told? By whom?
Suzuha: "I’m sorry for making you go through that, Uncle."
Rintaro: "Tell me what’s going on."
Suzuha: "See for yourself."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha points to the phone in my hand.
Suzuha: "Then you’ll understand."
Rintaro: "What are you talking about?"
Suzuha: "The message should already be in your phone. The message you sent from 2025."
Rintaro: "...What?"
Suzuha: "A video mail. You received one, didn’t you?"
Rintaro: "Ah...!"
UNSPOKEN: She’s right. When was that again? July 28th. Right after I met Kurisu for the first time. Just as I was about to contact Mayuri, I received a mysterious video mail from an address I had never seen before. Is that what she’s talking about?
Rintaro: "But there was nothing on it. Just noise."
Suzuha: "Try again."
