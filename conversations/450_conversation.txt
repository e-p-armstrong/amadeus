Suzuha: This is crazy, Uncle. You're insane!
Rintaro: Insane? Nonsense. This is all... according to plan... heh heh... heh...
Suzuha: Don't talk. I'll take you back to August 21st. Try to endure the Gs, okay? Damn! I should've brought a first aid kit.
UNSPOKEN: I feel pressure crush my body. My wound throbs. I feel like groaning, but I bite my lip and bear it. Rainbow lights fill my vision. The time machine is activating. Suzuha wraps my wound with a towel.
Suzuha: Hey, Uncle. I'm sure Steins Gate is waiting for us on the other side. A world where nothing is known, where anything is possible. A world where you live, where Makise Kurisu lives, where Shiina Mayuri lives. A world where I have no reason to travel to 2010. The future may still lead to World War Three... It may lead to a dystopia ruled by SERN...
UNSPOKEN: Someone's warm hand grasps mine. Tightly. Tightly.
Suzuha: But now, there is hope for the future again.
UNSPOKEN: I slowly close my eyes. It's hard to breathe. But my pain feels distant now.
Suzuha: Once we arrive, I'll probably disappear. I won't be able to thank you for bringing me to Steins Gate. So I'll say it now.
UNSPOKEN: The warmth of her hand slowly fades away.
Suzuha: Thank you, Uncle. Don't die. Live. And in seven years... let's meet again, okay?
