UNSPOKEN: As soon as our eyes meet, he runs up to me in a fluster. His eyes are already wet with tears.
Luka: You were discharged today?
Rintaro: Yeah.
Luka: But... I'm sorry! I didn't know anything about it.
Rintaro: Of course you didn't. I didn't tell you.
Luka: But I'm glad you're okay. I'm... I'm so happy...
UNSPOKEN: And then he starts crying in earnest. Seeing his tears, I feel an urge to pat his head and tell him everything will be alright, but I resist and sigh instead.
Rintaro: I hear you were a natural at your cosplay debut. I hear you even have a fan club.
Luka: Augh...
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri filled me in on the situation. After years of persistent nagging, she finally convinced Lukako to cosplay near the end of summer break. It wasn't in time for ComiMa, but he wore one of Mayuri's costumes to a cosplay event in early September. His cosplay debut was... effective. Dozens of photographers took his picture, and the images soon went viral on the net. Try to look up pictures of Lukako now, and you'll get a ton of hits. He's being swarmed by fans. And since he's what they call a trap, he's popular with girls, too. There are some things in this world I just don't understand.
Luka: To be honest, it's so confusing...
Rintaro: You know, I still haven't had the pleasure to see you cosplay in the flesh.
Luka: I... I just can't. If Okabe-san were to see me... I'd get so embarrassed, I'd die.
Rintaro: But you had fun, didn't you? That's what Mayuri said.
Luka: ...Yes.
Rintaro: You've grown up, Lukako.
UNSPOKEN: He's overcome his feelings of inadequacy and accepted himself for who he is. And he even had fun doing it.
Luka: Okabe-sa... I mean, Kyouma-san, it's all thanks to the Seishin Zanma style you taught me. I've cleared my mind of all mundane thoughts.
UNSPOKEN: He truly is a worthy disciple.
Rintaro: But you must not grow complacent. Your next objective is to ascend to the true form of the Seishin Zanma style. Once you've mastered it, the flames of evil sealed within you will have nothing left to burn. That moment will mark the beginning of the legend of Urushibara Luka, Guardian Miko of the Personapolis of Akihabara!
Luka: Umm, what exactly will this legend be about?
Rintaro: I shall tell you at the proper time.
UNSPOKEN: I reach into my pocket, and take out a pin.
Rintaro: Lab Mem Number 006, Urushibara Luka. I grant this unto you.
UNSPOKEN: Lukako nervously accepts the pin with a confused expression.
Luka: Um... when did I become a lab mem?
Rintaro: It's a memory from beyond the veil of time. Your past life, I suppose you could say.
Luka: M-my past life?
Rintaro: You've been a lab mem from the moment you were born. Be proud.
