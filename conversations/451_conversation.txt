UNSPOKEN: Are you kidding me? Is that even possible? I’m not convinced, but I check my phone anyway, just to be sure. And there, I find a saved video mail. When I check the sender’s address, I realize that it’s from the same address as the D-Mail just now. So they’re from the same person. And this person... is me in fifteen years? Fifteen years. 2025. The year I die, according to Suzuha. I sent this message on the eve of my death, a message to myself in 2010. Suzuha said that there was a plan to reach Steins Gate. Could that plan be in this video? Mayuri and Daru peek over my shoulder. I take a deep breath... And press play with a trembling finger. Nothing appears on the screen but noise. Nothing has changed after all. There’s no hidden message or anyth--
Rintaro: "...!?"
UNSPOKEN: The noise suddenly dissolves, revealing the silhouette of a man. It looks like the video was shot somewhere dark. I can’t see the man’s face. Unkempt hair. A lab coat. That’s all I can make out.
Itaru: "Is that you in fifteen years?"
Mayuri: "It has to be! Something about him just says ’Okarin.’"
UNSPOKEN: Really? Is this guy really me? My phone’s tiny screen has become a window onto the future. I can’t believe I’m about to hear a message from myself.
Okabe: "Did you get my email? Then go watch the news. If you already have, then keep listening."
UNSPOKEN: So that last mail was from him. From me. It doesn’t feel real.
Okabe: "Greetings. It’s been fifteen years, I suppose you could say."
Mayuri: "Wow, your voice is so deep and cool!"
Okabe: "The year is 2025. I’m sending this video by a process similar to D-Mail. You dismantled the PhoneWave. So did I. But not one year later, I -- which is to say you -- turned back to time travel as my last hope. I’ve spent fourteen years researching time travel. Along the way, I managed to design a D-Mail transmitter that wasn’t bound by the 36-byte limit. The fact that you’re watching this means that you failed to save Kurisu. It hurts, doesn’t it? I know how you feel. After all, I went through it myself fifteen years ago. That’s right. I failed too. I’ve lived with that failure for fifteen years. Do you understand why you had to fail? It was necessary. Necessary to give me the proper motivation. You failed to save Kurisu. You killed her with your own two hands. Your guilt, your self-loathing, have driven me for fifteen years. They gave me the focus I needed to complete my plan. Without your failure, you would not be watching this message now. As you know, this worldline is subject to attractor field convergence. Time travel alone cannot save Kurisu. That is why you had to fail. To create the chain of causality that linked you to me. Because you failed, I spent the last fifteen years researching time travel. As the revelations Nakabachi unleashed sped the world towards nuclear war, I continued my research in secret. Suzuha’s time machine is the result. Although the finishing touches were Daru’s and mine, its design was based on the theory that SERN first developed... ...and that Kurisu improved on the worldline you undid. Its model number is C204. C for Christina. I believe you understand what that signifies. Now that the causal link has been established, allow me to explain the final stage of the plan. The purpose of this plan is to change divergence and reach the unknown worldline called Steins Gate. By the way, I’m the one who named it Steins Gate. You, of all people, know why I chose that name. Because it sounds cool. Isn’t that right? There are two conditions you must meet to reach Steins Gate. First, you must save Makise Kurisu. Second, you must destroy the Nakabachi Paper. I know what you’re thinking. Convergence won’t let you change the past. No matter what you do, Kurisu will die. But rest assured, there is a way. You can save Kurisu. Listen carefully. On July 28th, the first you went to Nakabachi’s presentation blissfully unaware of what was about to happen. You must not change what the first you saw. Those events have been established. They are the result upon which this worldline converges. However. There is room for deception. You don’t understand, I know. Calm down. I’ll explain. You’re going to deceive yourself. The first you saw Kurisu lying in a pool of blood. If you were to change that fact, it would render everything that you have done since -- as well as everything that I have done -- a paradox. After finding Kurisu’s body, you sent a D-Mail, which was intercepted by Echelon, which tipped off SERN. Recall your experiences on the Alpha worldline. You saw more than just Mayuri’s death. You saw Kurisu alive and well. You made her a lab member despite her protests, and together, you built the Time Leap Machine. It was only three weeks, but she was there, beside you. Those memories are yours. Those memories are mine. They are the proof that we did not live only on this worldline, where Kurisu died on July 28th. You traveled to the Alpha worldline. You met Kurisu and fell in love. You sacrificed the dreams of those closest to you. But still, you fought to give Mayuri a future. For three weeks, you fought. And now, those memories are part of you. If you had not seen Kurisu’s body in the hallway of Radi-Kan... You would not have sent that first D-Mail. SERN would not have found you. When you encountered Kurisu later, you would not have been shocked to see her alive. You would not have spoken the words that led her to your doorstep. Without those memories... You would not now be willing to travel through time to save her. I would not have spent my life searching for a path to Steins Gate. I would not have recorded this message. Daru and I would not have completed the time machine. Suzuha would not be standing beside you now. You must not reject the three weeks you spent drifting between worldlines. You must not undo the past! Those three weeks made you who you are, a man who would do anything to save the woman he loves. Your desperation made me who I am, a man who has given everything to make that dream come true. This moment would not be possible if not for the memories that you and I share! The man you were trying to create, a man with none of those memories to drive him, could never stand where you stand now. It all meant something. My preparations are complete. The rest is up to you. The final phase of Operation Skuld will now commence. Your mission: change the outcome without changing established events. You saw Makise Kurisu lying in a pool of blood. That has been established. But at the same time, only that has been established. Deceive yourself. Deceive the world. That is the choice which will lead you to Steins Gate. Good luck, mad scientist. El. Psy. Kongroo."
