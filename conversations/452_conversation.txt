Luka: No, it's just... I'm really happy... sniff.
UNSPOKEN: He starts crying again.
Luka: I always wanted... to be a part of your lab... I wanted to be one of you... But... I never had the courage to ask... Thank you so much.
UNSPOKEN: He bows his head.
Rintaro: This is a precious artifact. Only eight of them exist in the entire world. It's a magic item that protects you from all calamity.
Luka: R-really?
UNSPOKEN: No.
Rintaro: So don't lose it.
Luka: I won't!
UNSPOKEN: Lukako nods, with a joyful smile on his face. ...Too cute.
Faris: Welcome back, myasterâ™ª
UNSPOKEN: I pass through MayQueen's door for the first time in forever. Faris runs over to greet me.
Faris: Kyouma!
UNSPOKEN: She suddenly links arms with me. At first, I get a little flustered when something soft touches my elbow. But then I break into cold sweat once I feel the murderous glares of the surrounding Faris fans.
Faris: They let you outta the hospital, nya?
Rintaro: Y-yeah. I managed to claw my way out of hell.
UNSPOKEN: I tear Faris off of me and take a deep breath.
Faris: Purrcisely what I expected from the Hououin bloodline... The name of the undying phoenix isn't just for show, nya.
UNSPOKEN: I see she's still making up her own backstories for people. It boggles the mind that this crazy catgirl is behind the redevelopment of Akihabara. Maybe the world's just messed up.
Faris: Mayushii has the day off, nya.
Rintaro: I know.
UNSPOKEN: She shows me to my table, where I order iced coffee.
Faris: Oh, right. We decided to open a second MayQueen location, nya. And it's right on Chuo-dori, nyan. Isn't that awesome, nya?
Rintaro: Don't you think you're abusing your authority as redevelopment committee chair? Just a little?
UNSPOKEN: No doubt the recent explosion of moe shops is her doing. I think she's getting just a little carried away.
Faris: This is my sacred duty, nya. Now is the time to summon all the powers of moe to this holy land in preparation for their offensive, nya.
Rintaro: What? They're going to attack? Did the Awakening occur while I was in the hospital?
Faris: That's right, nya. They took your absence as their opportunity, nya. Will we be able to complete the moefication of Akiba before they hatch? That's the only way to defeat them! It's a race against time, nya. Faris also fought in the RaiNet AB tournament to gather Karma, but it was really tough by myself, nya.
