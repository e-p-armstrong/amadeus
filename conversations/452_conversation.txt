Rintaro: "Heh... heh heh heh..."
UNSPOKEN: Laughter bubbles up from the depths of my soul. Not minutes ago, I was lost in despair. I was ready to kill myself for what I had done. But now... I’m laughing.
Rintaro: "Heh heh heh, hehehehe..."
UNSPOKEN: Operation Skuld? El Psy Kongroo?
Rintaro: "I’m thirty-three years old and I still have no shame? Deceive myself? Deceive the world? That’s such chuuni bullshit!"
UNSPOKEN: It’s pathetic. Laughable. A juvenile fantasy. But at the same time... it feels right.
Rintaro: "Very well! If this is the choice of Steins Gate, then so be it! I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma! Deceiving the world is child’s play! It looks like I have to change the world after all! MUHAHAHAHA!"
Itaru: "Whoa! I thought Okarin was finally turning serious, but now he’s back to his usual antics."
Mayuri: "But you know, Mayushii likes Okarin better this way♪"
Itaru: "Yeah, I know what you mean. Okarin just isn’t Okarin unless he’s laughing like an idiot."
Mayuri: "Hououin Kyouma saved Mayushii, you know. So this time, he’ll definitely save Makise Kurisu!"
Itaru: "But ’deceive the world’? What’s that supposed to mean?"
Mayuri: "Ummm... Mayushii doesn’t have a clue..."
Rintaro: "Heh heh heh... Isn’t it obvious? The only established fact about the past is that I saw Kurisu lying in a pool of blood. That’s the extent of my observation. Kurisu was lying in a pool of blood. As for whether she was alive or dead... That’s still open to interpretation."
UNSPOKEN: Isn’t that right, future me?
Mayuri: "Huh?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri tilts her head. She still doesn’t get it.
Rintaro: "For example, just think of it like this. Kurisu was merely unconscious, and the blood was just a coat of red paint."
Mayuri: "Oh! Is that what happened?"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri’s eyes open wide in wonder. I give up. She’s not going to understand.
Itaru: "Wait a second. The news reports all said that she was--"
Suzuha: "What’s true now doesn’t matter. Only what Uncle Okarin saw on July 28th matters."
Itaru: "R-really?"
UNSPOKEN: Really. And that’s because I’m not the Okabe Rintaro who lived on the Beta worldline after Kurisu died. I traveled to the Alpha worldline and back. I am not bound by whatever effect Kurisu’s death may have had during that time.
Rintaro: "What I’m going to do is recreate what I saw, and only what I saw. But this time, I’ll do it so Kurisu doesn’t have to die."
Suzuha: "Don’t forget you also need to destroy the Nakabachi Paper. Can you handle it?"
Rintaro: "Who do you think you’re talking to, Part-Time Warrior?"
Suzuha: "...Part-time warrior?"
