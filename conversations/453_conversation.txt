UNSPOKEN: I disregard the blank stares of my comrades and brush back my hair with a flourish.
Rintaro: "My plan is flawless. Operation Skuld will succeed! But I need to prepare. Give me 30 minutes."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha tightens her expression and nods firmly. I squat against the roof’s chain fence with my eyes closed. To refresh my memory, I pull out the drawers of my mental archive and sort through each file one by one. My actions that day. Mayuri’s actions. My conversation with Kurisu. Nakabachi’s presentation. With those memories to guide me, I begin to draw up a plan for how to complete my mission.
Mayuri: "Okarin! I got the stuff!"
UNSPOKEN: I open my eyes once I hear Mayuri’s voice.
Rintaro: "Then it’s time."
UNSPOKEN: I take a deep breath and stand up. Mayuri’s faster on her feet than Daru and I are, so I had her pick up some things for me. She went all the way to the lab and back in the sweltering heat, but she’s not even breathing hard. She runs up to me with a triumphant smile. Almost like a playful puppy, shaking her tail.
Mayuri: "Here you go. Will this work?"
UNSPOKEN: In her hand is a plastic stick, about 30 cm long. I take it and nod in satisfaction.
Rintaro: "Good work, Mayuri."
Mayuri: "Ehehe! Mayushii’s happy to be useful to Okarin♪ Oh! I also brought you this."
UNSPOKEN: She hands me a banana. I guess she’s telling me not to time travel on an empty stomach.
Suzuha: "What’s that?"
Mayuri: "A banana!"
Suzuha: "No, I mean that stick."
Rintaro: "It’s not a stick. It’s a sword. One of our lab’s many inventions -- Future Gadget No. 6: The Cyalume Saber!"
Suzuha: "Cyalume Saber?"
Itaru: "It’s a red cyalume glow stick. An essential item for idol and voice actress concerts."
Rintaro: "But it’s not just a glow stick. It’s saber shaped, just as its name implies, so you can reenact scenes from Spark Wars."
Suzuha: "Um... wow?"
Rintaro: "Furthermore, it can also form fake blood clots. Detach the cap at the tip, and thick ’blood’ starts flowing out."
Suzuha: "I, uh, really don’t get what you were trying to accomplish when you made this..."
Itaru: "We wanted to make our sword fights more realistic."
Rintaro: "What he means to say is that everything is inevitable."
Suzuha: "I think I see the plan. You’re gonna use that cyalume stuff as a stand-in for Makise Kurisu’s blood, aren’t you?"
Rintaro: "Precisely."
