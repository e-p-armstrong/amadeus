Rintaro: "Leave it to me. I... will change the world."
UNSPOKEN: I follow Suzuha into the time machine. While waiting for Mayuri to return, I asked Suzuha if there was a chance that I might run into myself from last time -- in other words, the me who killed Kurisu. She replied that wasn’t possible. The worldline where I killed Kurisu is minutely different from the one to which the time machine will take us. Time travel has a very small effect on divergence, much too small to cause any noticeable changes, but enough to ensure that there can never be two versions of the same time traveler.  However, it is important to remember that worldlines are not parallel worlds. Ultimately, attractor field convergence merges them into a single worldline. My actions are not meaningless. If I succeed in deceiving both myself and the world, the entire universe will converge upon a different future.
Mayuri: "Okarin."
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri leans through the hatch and gently strokes my cheek.
Mayuri: "Come back, okay?"
Rintaro: "Of course."
UNSPOKEN: I return the smile and give her a thumbs up. I close the hatch as Daru and Mayuri see me off with words of encouragement. Suzuha’s already operating the time machine.
Suzuha: "The fate of the future hangs on this mission."
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha speaks as she presses some buttons.
Suzuha: "We’re counting on you, Uncle."
UNSPOKEN: Instead of answering, I close my eyes. I find myself strangely calm. No impatience. No tension. None of the anxiety I felt the first time. How many times have I tasted failure? My hubris hurt those closest to me. My foolishness cost them their dreams. And even though those mistakes have been undone, the memories still remain as a brand on my heart.
Okabe: "You must not reject the three weeks you spent drifting between worldlines. You must not undo the past!"
