UNSPOKEN: My heart leaps into my throat. That was Mayuri’s voice. She’s already here!? I quickly turn and leave the area before Mayuri can see my face. Luckily, she’s so entranced by the capsule toy machines that she doesn’t realize who I am. Once I get down to the fourth floor, I check the contents of the capsule. The metal Upa is inside. This is the prize that was meant for me. Which means the first me will get-- The answer is obvious. Phase one is complete. Time for phase two. I turn around abruptly.
Kurisu: "...Ah!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu is standing behind me, her mouth open in surprise. My timing was perfect.
Kurisu: "H-hey, you just came down from the--"
Rintaro: "I..."
Kurisu: "Eh?"
Rintaro: "...I’m going to save you."
UNSPOKEN: Leave everything to me.
Kurisu: "What?"
UNSPOKEN: I say no more. If I tell her everything, she’ll have no reason to talk to the first me. On July 28th, she came to me during Nakabachi’s presentation. She claimed that I had tried to tell her something, then proceeded to drag me out into the hallway for further questioning. That is part of my experience. This should be enough to ensure that it happens exactly as I remember. I pat Kurisu on the shoulder, then race back up the stairs.
Kurisu: "W-wait!"
UNSPOKEN: I run to the sixth floor, then creep up towards the seventh floor landing until I can just make out the capsule toy machines. As expected, there’s the first me about to turn the lever in Mayuri’s stead.
Mayuri: "Ah, it’s an Upa!"
Rintaro: "Is it rare?"
Mayuri: "It’s not rare, but isn’t it just so cute? Mayushii loves Upa!"
