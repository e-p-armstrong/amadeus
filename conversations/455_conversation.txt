UNSPOKEN: I think Daru needs to die for a bit. I bop Mayuri on the head.
Rintaro: I'll buy you some Juicy Chicken Number One later.
Mayuri: Really? Thanks, Okarin! It was worth it to help you after all! Eheheâ™ª
UNSPOKEN: I breathe another sigh of relief when I see Mayuri's innocent smile. Mayuri is still alive. I've seen her die countless times. Though the events of those worldlines have been undone, my struggle to escape them was not in vain. If the same thing were to happen again, what would I do? Would I accept her death this time? Or would I try again to save her, even if it meant building another time machine? There's no way to know. The future is undecided. But for now, Mayuri is here. And that means everything to me.
Rintaro: Here, take these.
UNSPOKEN: I give Mayuri and Daru their pins.
Mayuri: It's so cute!
Itaru: Nice, they're finally done!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri pins the badge to her chest and shows it off with a pirouette.
Mayuri: Gotta be sure to put this on every day. Or else I won't be let into the lab!
UNSPOKEN: Nobody really made that rule, but whatever.
Mayuri: But you know, there's something I've been meaning to ask you about the pin.
Rintaro: What's that?
Mayuri: There's an inscription, right? It says 'OSHMKUFA 2010'. Okabe, Shiina, Hashida. And then Urushibara and Faris. I got those. But what about M, K, and A? Who are they?
UNSPOKEN: M for Makise. K for Kiryu. A for Amane. But the current Mayuri wouldn't understand. Those three were lab mems on a worldline undone and forgotten. I haven't told Mayuri or Daru about them. They wouldn't believe me even if I told them. Especially about the last initial, A. I mean, how do I tell Daru he's going to have a daughter? I can just imagine his reaction.
Itaru: Who's my lucky bride-to-be? I hope she's got a cute face, and delicious flat chest, and blonde hair, and twintails, and a golden ratio tsundere personality. And when she's in dere-mode, she's super cuddly and sexy!
UNSPOKEN: He'd say something gross like that. No doubt. I remember. As I lay dying in the time machine, Suzuha gripped my hand and said...
Suzuha: Once we arrive, I'll probably disappear. I won't be able to thank you for bringing me to Steins Gate. So I'll thank you now. Thank you, Uncle. Don't die. Live.
UNSPOKEN: Just as she predicted, Suzuha vanished the moment we returned to August 21st. Right before my very eyes, the time machine was enveloped in rainbow light and disappeared. She was smiling as she faded away. That was proof I had reached Steins Gate. And that's why I don't mourn Suzuha.
Suzuha: And in seven years... let's meet again, okay?
