UNSPOKEN: Hououin Kyouma will save Kurisu. I close my eyes and wait for the time to come, hidden behind the same pile of cardboard boxes as last time. I hear the sound of sparse applause from the event hall. Which means I should be hearing footsteps soon... There they are. Kurisu has come, right on time. She leans against the wall and looks inside her envelope, smiling softly as she does. And now, I know the reason behind that smile. It’s the Upa inside. She’s probably smiling at how adorable it is. That smile really doesn’t suit you, Kurisu. I stifle a chuckle. I’m surprised I’m calm enough to feel that way, despite the current situation. Once Nakabachi appears, that’s my signal to spring into action. I’ll bring out the Cyalume Saber as soon as that bastard tries to take out his knife. Then I’ll scare him away and stun Kurisu. The stun gun I brought should handle both tasks flawlessly. That’s the plan, at least. The next set of footsteps echoes down the hallway. Kurisu looks up. I can’t see Nakabachi, but I know it’s him.
Kurisu: "...I wanted to talk. Are you listening, Papa?"
UNSPOKEN: Even the words she speaks are the same.
Nakabachi: "What is that?"
Kurisu: "I heard you were giving a presentation on time travel. So I thought about it too. Could it be possible to make a time machine?"
UNSPOKEN: The atmosphere is far from pleasant. Nakabachi doesn’t even try to hide his displeasure. And the first me is probably at fault for that. At least partially. Looks like it’s about time for Nakabachi to go ballistic. I grip the Cyalume Saber and make one final check. It’s already dimmed down. Now all I have to do is remove the cap at the tip, and the fake blood will--
Rintaro: "...!?"
UNSPOKEN: My breath catches in my throat. In the darkness of my hiding spot, I bring the Cyalume Saber close to my eyes and peer inside. The fake blood has begun to coagulate. No. This shouldn’t happen. I was certain the liquid would remain fluid for around 30 minutes after losing luminescence. Was it defective!? Come to think of it, we never tested the Cyalume Saber. It can only be used once before the tube needs to be replaced. Given the lab’s financial situation, we thought it would be a waste to use it, so we never did. How could I have failed to consider this possibility!? If I’d had half a brain, I would have brought a spare! This is bad. The plan is falling apart.
Nakabachi: "I wasn’t shunned!"
UNSPOKEN: Nakabachi’s shrill shriek startles me.
Nakabachi: "Those incompetent bastards were just jealous of my superiority. I was the one who gave up on them!"
Kurisu: "Please don’t yell..."
