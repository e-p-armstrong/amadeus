UNSPOKEN: I whip out the stun gun and switch it on. The electric arc crackles to life inches away from Nakabachi’s face. He instantly turns pale.
Rintaro: "Now you’ve done it..."
UNSPOKEN: I spear him with my glare and take a step forward. A wave of nausea surges over me.
Rintaro: "Gach..."
UNSPOKEN: Blood spews from my throat. But I don’t look away. I keep my eyes fixed on Nakabachi.
Rintaro: "You’ll regret this, old man! I’m going... to kill you..."
Nakabachi: "Heeee...!"
Rintaro: "You and the girl... I’ll kill you both!"
Kurisu: "Don’t move!"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu runs up to me. She holds me and supports my body.
Kurisu: "Lie down! I’ll call an ambulance!"
UNSPOKEN: What is she doing trying to help me? Didn’t she hear me threaten to kill her? You’re too soft-hearted for a tsundere. Back when I was trying to save Mayuri, you were always the one who saved me. So this time--
Rintaro: "I’m going to save you."
Kurisu: "What-- ----"
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu convulses. Strength leaves the legs she used to support me. She collapses. I’m sorry. I send her my silent apology.
Rintaro: "I’ll be sure... to have my way with your daughter... before I kill her... But first... is you, Nakabachi! Muhahahaha..."
Nakabachi: "Heeeeee!"
UNSPOKEN: Nakabachi tosses his knife away with a pitiful cry. He takes a step back. Two steps back.
Nakabachi: "Hyeehhhhhh!"
UNSPOKEN: Firing the stungun once more does the trick. Nakabachi turns and flees down the hallway toward the elevators. But first, he makes sure to pick up the envelope Kurisu dropped. How shrewd of him.
Rintaro: "Haah... haah... haah..."
UNSPOKEN: I touch my wound.
Rintaro: "Ugg..."
