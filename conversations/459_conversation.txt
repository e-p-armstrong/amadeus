UNSPOKEN: I reach for my stomach, wet and glistening with blood. I take a breath, then drive my fingers into the wound.
Rintaro: "Gah!"
UNSPOKEN: The pain is like nothing I’ve ever experienced. Unable to bear it, I throw back my head.
Rintaro: "AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!"
UNSPOKEN: I scream until my throat is raw. I can’t stop now! Fighting against the urge to faint, I feed strength into my hands and pull the wound wider.
Rintaro: "Gach, haah, haah, gghh, khah..."
UNSPOKEN: My blood paints the floor crimson.
Suzuha: "Uncle Okarin!"
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha runs up to me.
Suzuha: "Th-that wound! What happened!? What were you thinking!? If you die... if we fail...!"
Rintaro: "Heh... heh heh..."
Suzuha: "Uncle...?"
Rintaro: "You forget who you’re dealing with, Suzuha. Look at the floor... notice anything?"
Suzuha: "The floor?"
Rintaro: "Heh heh... that should be enough blood... don’t you think?"
UNSPOKEN: She looks down and beholds my masterpiece.
Suzuha: "A pool of blood!"
UNSPOKEN: To deceive myself. To deceive the world. The stage is set!
Suzuha: "But Uncle, you’ll die!"
Rintaro: "Heh, there’s no way I’m going to die... Who do you think I am? I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma..."
Suzuha: "Uncle..."
UNSPOKEN: If convergence holds, then it’s already determined that I don’t die. Not here. I die in 2025. That’s a fixed event on the Beta worldline. That was my bet. I intentionally provoked Nakabachi to rage. I took the knife meant for Kurisu and survived. The wound gave me what I needed to carry out the plan. Though I have to admit, I didn’t think it would hurt this much. There’s no telling what will happen when we reach Steins Gate. The future of that worldline is still undecided. There’s no reason it can’t include my death. How ironic. I made a bet based on the guarantee that I wouldn’t die, but winning that bet makes death a very real possibility. I twist my lips into a smile. Time to put the finishing touch on my masterpiece.
Rintaro: "Suzuha... get Kurisu..."
Suzuha: "Ah, okay!"
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha picks up the unconscious Kurisu. Then she lays her face down on top of my blood puddle. Kurisu doesn’t wake up. She’s perfectly still. But she’s definitely breathing. I stroke her hair gently.
Rintaro: "Did it hurt? I’m sorry... but I had to do it... to save you. Even though those three weeks... will never come back... I want you to live."
UNSPOKEN: Even if we reach Steins Gate. Even if Kurisu lives. Even if I don’t die. We’ll never meet again. Kurisu will never join the lab. We will never build the Time Leap Machine together. But still, I’m glad I was able to save her.
Rintaro: "...Goodbye."
