Rintaro: "But I can’t help you look for the IBN 5100 anymore, okay?"
Tennouji: "Don’t be like that. Help her out, will ya?"
Rintaro: "I can’t. I’m a busy man."
UNSPOKEN: Catch the attention of the Rounders again? No thanks. Besides, the three of them are better off if we never find an IBN 5100. I end the conversation with a shrug and head to the stairs.
Moeka: "Okabe-kun."
UNSPOKEN: Moeka calls my name. I turn back to see Moeka smiling, ever so faintly.
Moeka: "Thank you... for this."
Rintaro: "...Yeah."
UNSPOKEN: The hatred I once felt towards them is gone. I forgave Moeka and Tennouji both. Now that I’ve destroyed our time machine, we can go back to being good neighbors. I won’t pry into their secret lives, and I won’t attempt to fight them either. It’s all up to them. However... The affection that Nae showed towards Moeka brings an undeniable warmth to my heart. Right as I walk into the lab, I’m greeted by the chiming of a microwave oven.
Mayuri: "Okarin!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri smiles brightly as she takes her Juicy Chicken Number One out of the microwave.
Mayuri: "Tutturu♪ Welcome backarin!"
Rintaro: "Did you just combine ’welcome back’ and ’Okarin’?"
Mayuri: "Yup. I’ve said it before, remember?"
UNSPOKEN: Then Mayuri holds out the steaming chicken.
Mayuri: "Want some too? I’ll give you one to celebrate your homecoming♪"
UNSPOKEN: I accept the gift of chicken and pop it into my mouth. I guess it’s because I’ve had nothing but crappy hospital food for a month, but it’s so delicious I want to cry.
Rintaro: "Where did you get that microwave?"
UNSPOKEN: We disassembled the PhoneWave (name subject to change) weeks ago.
Itaru: "Oh, that was me."
UNSPOKEN: Daru pops out of the development room in all his rotund glory. I wonder if he’s making a new Future Gadget.
Rintaro: "You bought it?"
Itaru: "I found it, duh. It was a pain to repair."
Mayuri: "It’s kinda old, but it still works fine."
Rintaro: "That’s our super hacka. Now let’s keep up that pace and make the next Future Gadget."
Mayuri: "That reminds me, Okarin. I’m mad at you!"
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri suddenly puts on a pout.
Mayuri: "Why did you leave the hospital without telling Mayushii? We went all the way to the hospital to pick you up, but the nurse said you’d already left!"
Itaru: "That was one hot nurse. I wish I was hospitalized instead of Okarin."
Rintaro: "You think you’re my guardian now, Mayuri? Hmph, you’ve certainly come up in the world. Have you forgotten? I’m the one who protects you."
Mayuri: "I even helped you with your diaper."
Rintaro: "Guh..."
