Kurisu: Yeah? What are you going to do with it?
UNSPOKEN: Looks like she’s interested. She was the same way when she came to the lab. I guess this girl is just brimming with curiosity.
Rintaro: Interested?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu quickly averts her eyes. But she doesn’t let go of my arm.
Rintaro: You’re interested, aren’t you?
Kurisu: ...Just a little.
Rintaro: Then I shall answer! The IBN 5100 is the key to unlocking SERN’s most closely guarded secrets.
Kurisu: SERN? You mean... the SERN?
Rintaro: Indeed. Through the tireless efforts of my faithful lab mems, we have uncovered evidence that SERN is researching time travel.
UNSPOKEN: Come! Be astonished!
Kurisu: ...Great. I shouldn’t have asked.
