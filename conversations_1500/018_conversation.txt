Rintaro: Yeah... thanks for the help... you’re... a lifesaver... Phew, really... thanks...
Luka: Ah, no...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako starts fidgeting.
Luka: Since you’re my master, Kyouma-san, I’m happy... to be of use to you.
UNSPOKEN: He doesn’t wipe the sweat off his brow. But despite that, Lukako turns to me with a brave smile as he speaks. So cute... But he’s a guy. It’s so disappointing! I look up to the second floor to see the lights turned on. Let’s get the IBN 5100 into the lab. The final barrier awaits. We have to ascend this rickety building’s narrow staircase. That’s surely impossible for just Lukako and me. Might as well call for help.
Rintaro: Come forth, my servants! By the covenant I command thee, grant me thy power!
Luka: K-Kyouma-san!?
UNSPOKEN: The second story window opens when I cry out. The face that appears is--
Kurisu: You’re so annoying! What is it!?
Rintaro: Huh, I summoned an assistant. What are you doing here?
Kurisu: Who’re you calling an assistant? You wouldn’t pick up your phone, so I’ve been waiting here an hour for you.
