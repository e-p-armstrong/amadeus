Rintaro: Are you incapable of doing anything without my instructions?
Mayuri: First, we need to buy a lottery ticket.
Kurisu: No, first we need a winning number.
Rintaro: Exactly, Celeb Seventeen! Now you’re talking.
Kurisu: Don’t call me Celeb Seventeen.
Itaru: First, we have to decide which lottery to go for. Think we should go for Dream Summer Jumbo?
Mayuri: I saw a TV commercial for that the other day!
Rintaro: Did they announce the winners?
Itaru: Should be next week or the week after.
Rintaro: Then there’s no point! We can only send D-Mails to the past!
Itaru: Oh, right. We could wait until the Summer Jumbo drawing date.
Rintaro: You’ve got your priorities backwards. Don’t get fixated on Summer Jumbo. Let’s look at the last lottery that announced its winners.
Itaru: Hmmm, I’ll google it.
UNSPOKEN: Daru starts searching on his computer. Meanwhile, Kurisu is thinking hard.
Kurisu: If someone sent me the winning numbers from the future, would I believe it?
Mayuri: Um, Mayushii doesn’t even know how to buy a lottery ticket...
Kurisu: That’s okay. I don’t think teenage girls buy lottery tickets.
