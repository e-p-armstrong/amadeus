Rintaro: W-wait! 1st prize is too much!
Itaru: Why?
Kurisu: That is an awful lot of money... hahaha...
Rintaro: No, not that. 1st place would be... too conspicuous.
Kurisu: What?
Rintaro: Don’t you get it!? I’m being chased by the Organization. If we win 1st prize, the media will cover the event and my cover will be blown!
Kurisu: That’s stupid.
Mayuri: What if Mayushii wins?
Rintaro: No. Stage Two of Operation Urd does have its risks, just like Celeb Sev said.
Kurisu: Celeb... Sev? Don’t abbreviate it.
Rintaro: I’ll be the winner. That way, I shoulder all of the risk.
Kurisu: And all of the money, right? I see your plan.
UNSPOKEN: I ignore Celeb Sev’s remark. The prospect of pocketing 200 million yen is certainly appetizing, but that would be too big a change to the past.  Just like Celeb Sev said, we can’t ignore the Butterfly Effect. We should flap our wings as softly as possible. I’m not scared or anything. Really.
Rintaro: Anyway, we should aim a little lower. Daru, how much is 2nd prize?
Itaru: Umm, looks like it was... 23 million yen.
Rintaro: ...L-let’s try 3rd prize.
Itaru: That was only 700, 000 yen.
Rintaro: Yeah, that’s good. That should be about right.
Kurisu: You’re such a chicken.
Rintaro: Heh, heh heh heh! That’s rich, coming from the one who was so worried about the risk of time paradoxes. Eh, Celeb Sev!?
Kurisu: I’m begging you, stop calling me that. I’ll settle for assistant. And don’t misunderstand. I’m still worried about what could go wrong.
Rintaro: I’m trying to minimize our risk by choosing an amount that’s just right. Stop being so stubborn.
Kurisu: ...No, you.
