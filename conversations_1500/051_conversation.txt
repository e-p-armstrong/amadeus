UNSPOKEN: I still don’t believe in the many-worlds interpretation or Titor’s attractor field theory. Actually, I’m starting to doubt them more and more. If we want to know how the world works, we’ll have to figure it out ourselves. And to do that, we need to experiment. One thing I’m sure of is that the mass disappearance in Akiba is related to D-Mails somehow, as is the strange disconnect between my memories and everyone else’s. According to Titor, I have a supernatural power -- the one I call Reading Steiner. My doubts about Titor’s veracity aside, I do need to determine if I am indeed the only person who keeps his memories when the past changes.
Rintaro: Change the past to your liking. As long as it’s something easy to observe.
UNSPOKEN: Preparations for the PhoneWave (name subject to change) are complete. Daru’s eyes wander to the ceiling in thought. Next to him, Kurisu shrugs her shoulders and starts gathering her things.
Kurisu: I’m going back to my hotel. Show me your report on today’s experiment tomorrow.
Rintaro: Hold it!
UNSPOKEN: When I grab her by the shoulder, Kurisu nearly topples over.
Kurisu: Hey! What’s your problem!?
Rintaro: Who’s writing that report?
Kurisu: You, of course. This is your operation. And if we could get a report from the subject too, that would be even better.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu glances at Daru.
Rintaro: ...Are you not interested in changing the past? What happened to your eagerness to experiment?
Kurisu: Did you forget what I said this afternoon? I’m against it.
Rintaro: But you were so enthusiastic when we began the experiments. You went along without a single complaint.
Kurisu: In your dreams, maybe.
UNSPOKEN: I twist my lips into a grin.
Rintaro: You’re not being objective, Christi... Celeb Sev.
Kurisu: If you’re going to correct yourself, at least get it right.
