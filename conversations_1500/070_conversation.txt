Rintaro: ...Damn. Okay. Sorry for calling you so suddenly.
Luka: N-no problem. I’m sorry that I couldn’t help..
UNSPOKEN: The IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine. That’s a fact. And Lukako knew that. I need to check if it’s still there or not. Could the IBN 5100 have returned to the shrine? Did that huge retro PC sprout legs and trot back? That’s just silly. But gelbanas have teleported out of the microwave. Moeka also instantly moved from the lab to somewhere else. Considering that, it’s entirely possible that the same thing happened to the IBN 5100. Maybe I should go check later. Next is Faris. By the way, I haven’t told Faris my phone number. I’m afraid that if I talk to her on the phone, she’ll drag me into her usual nonsense. So there’s only one option.
Rintaro: Mayuri, I need to contact Faris.
Mayuri: Hweh?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri’s eating an eclair. She must have stuck some in the fridge when I wasn’t looking.
Mayuri: Want one, Okarin? They’re delicious♪
UNSPOKEN: Now that she mentions it, Kurisu and Daru are eating too.
Rintaro: You people don’t have a care in the world, do you!? There’s some crazy stuff happening here!
Kurisu: Or it could all just be in your head. No need to panic.
UNSPOKEN: It’s not just in my head. It’s not!
Mayuri: You need Feris-chan for something? I wonder if she’s working today.
Itaru: Faris-tan’s off today.
UNSPOKEN: Well done, Daru. You know Faris’s schedule better than her coworker. I award you the title of Faris Stalker.
Rintaro: You know her phone number, right? See if you can get ahold of her.
Mayuri: Okay!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri takes out her phone and makes a call. After a short wait, Mayuri smiles.
Mayuri: Feris-chan? Good afternyan-nyan♪ It’s Mayushii, nyan♪
Kurisu: Nya, nyan...?
