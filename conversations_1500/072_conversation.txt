UNSPOKEN: Daru, you horny fool, are you siding with Faris!? And you call yourself a super hacka!? Faris covers her phone with her body. Looks like she plans on hiding it to the bitter end. Should we halt the experiment?
Kurisu: Hey, Okabe. How long are you gonna make me wait?
UNSPOKEN: An impatient Kurisu nags me through the phone. Don’t rush me, dammit!
Mayuri: Um, Okarin, it’s probably something private, so I don’t think you should pry...
UNSPOKEN: Wh-what? Even Mayuri’s on Faris’s side? She was like this with Moeka too.
Rintaro: Mmmgh...
UNSPOKEN: This is bad. I thought I had Faris in the palm of my hand. Was I dancing to her tune all along!?
Kurisu: Okabe? If you’re not gonna send anything, I’m hanging up.
Rintaro: W-wait! Fine. Activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
UNSPOKEN: Dammit, I submitted to the catgirl!
Kurisu: The discharge is starting.
