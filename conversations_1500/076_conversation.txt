Rintaro: Naturally. Faris is a lab mem too. Heh heh heh.
Itaru: Dammit! Why do they have to be on the same day!? Can’t it wait until tomorrow?
Rintaro: What will it be? The time to choose is now.
Itaru: I want to eat Faris-tan’s home cooking...
Rintaro: If you give up the offline meet, then that settles it.
Itaru: I give up. I give up the offline meeeet!
UNSPOKEN: Daru surrenders all too quickly. When we return to the lab, Mayuri and Lukako are already starting preparations.
Mayuri: Huh? Daru-kun’s here too?
Itaru: What about Faris-tan? Where is she?
Kurisu: You’ve been tricked.
Mayuri: Feris-chan said she couldn’t come.
Itaru: Wait, seriously!? Okarin! What’s going on here!? This isn’t funny, man!
Rintaro: Don’t worry. I’ll make sure she comes to the next one.
Itaru: You’ve gotta be kidding me! I was looking forward to that time machine meet...
Kurisu: Time machine meet? What’s that?
Itaru: It’s an offline meet for this sci-fi BBS I post on. Some famous writers are going to be there. I won’t forgive you, Okarin. Ever.
Rintaro: What? Why didn’t you say so? I would’ve gone too!
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, I smell something strange.
Rintaro: ...Does anyone else smell that?
Kurisu: Smell what?
Rintaro: Did we blow a fuse somewhere?
Luka: S-sorry...
UNSPOKEN: Lukako’s apologizing for something.
Luka: That’s probably the smell of... Mayuri’s cooking...
UNSPOKEN: ...What? This is the smell of food!?
Kurisu: I’ll help too.
Luka: Okay, then warm these eggs please.
Kurisu: Hm. Should I use the PhoneWave?
Luka: N-no! If you put raw eggs in a microwave, they’ll explode!
Kurisu: We took the door off. It should be fine, right?
