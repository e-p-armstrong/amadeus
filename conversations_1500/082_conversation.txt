Kurisu: Then, once we’re done upgrading the PhoneWave... I want you to come with me.
Rintaro: As you wish. Where is your father, anyway?
Kurisu: Aomori.
Rintaro: Aomori!?
Kurisu: That’s where he lives now.
UNSPOKEN: That’s way up at the north end of the island, like seven hundred kilometers or something. I wasn’t expecting to have to go that far.
Kurisu: What? You’re not going to back out, are you? You already promised. I’m taking you whether you like it or not, okay!?
