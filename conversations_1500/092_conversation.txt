UNSPOKEN: What do you mean? I try to ask, but before I can finish-- An urgent news bulletin appears on the TV. The subtitles read Terrorist bomb threat suspends Yamanote, Sobu, Keihin-Tohoku lines.
Suzuha: A bomb threat?
Itaru: Hang on. Those lines all pass through Akiba. How is Mayu-shi gonna get home?
Mayuri: Oh yeah. I should call home.
UNSPOKEN: A bomb threat... I don’t know why, but I’ve got a bad feeling about this. Only the lines passing through Akihabara are suspended, as if that were the target. Wait. Could that be it? Could the bomb be at Akihabara Station? I get a cold feeling in my stomach.
Suzuha: Okabe Rintaro. I need to know. You’ve completed the Time Leap Machine, right?
Rintaro: Huh? Well, yeah...
Suzuha: Okay. I just remembered I’ve got something to do. I’m going out.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha leaves the lab without another word.
Kurisu: What’s wrong with her?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha’s acting strange. Is it related to the bomb threat? Why did she just ask about the Time Leap Machine? Something occurs to me. The two threatening emails I received... We’re watching you. You know too much. Who sent them? And there’s more. Words and images flash through my head. SERN. The LHC. Jellymen. The Z Program. Government secrets. The Organization. Men in black. The Committee of 300. The Time Leap Machine. What did Kurisu say?
Kurisu: We may have created a monster here...
