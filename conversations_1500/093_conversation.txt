Rintaro: This is a joke... right?
UNSPOKEN: Moeka shakes her head.
Moeka: You don’t need to know. You can’t resist. Come with us.
Rintaro: W-where?
UNSPOKEN: No reply. She doesn’t intend to answer that either. Dangerous. These guys are dangerous. Look at their guns. Nothing good can happen if we go with them. I try to refuse, but my voice catches in my throat. I can’t stop staring at their guns. Are they real? They’re not going to start shooting, are they?
Rintaro: I’m n-not going anywhere until you answer.
Moeka: You can’t refuse. You have nowhere to run. We have men stationed throughout Akihabara.
UNSPOKEN: Wait... Something clicks in my head. It was them. They sent the bomb threat. They stopped the trains. Why? To keep us here? Just for that?
Moeka: I don’t want to hurt anyone. The three of you, come with us.
Kurisu: Why...
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu, who has kept silent until now, finally opens her mouth.
Kurisu: Why just the three of us?
