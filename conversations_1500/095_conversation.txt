UNSPOKEN: What is she saying?
Suzuha: Turned on.
Moeka: What...
UNSPOKEN: Suddenly, Kurisu springs up and makes a break for the development room.
Moeka: Don’t move!
Suzuha: That’s my line!
Moeka: ...Tch.
UNSPOKEN: I suddenly realize the meaning of Suzuha’s words. The 42-inch TV downstairs. It’s on. She wants me to use the Time Leap Machine!? I look at Mayuri’s body. She’s lying there quietly. Her eyes are closed. They’ll never open again. One of the men Suzuha knocked out starts to moan. If they wake up, it’s all over. Suzuha looks at me again. Her eyes implore me to make my move. If I use the machine, I can avert Mayuri’s death. But at the same time, it could fry my brain. Fry my brain? So what? What is there to fear? Mayuri is dead, shot in cold blood. This isn’t right. I won’t accept it! Then change it. Change the past. You have the power. Use it! I stagger into the development room. Kurisu is about to put on the headgear. I pull it away from her.
Kurisu: Okabe...
Rintaro: I’m going back!
Kurisu: No! I should be the one to--
UNSPOKEN: I grab Kurisu’s wrist as she tries to take it back. I stare into her eyes, eyes wet with tears.
Rintaro: I will save Mayuri!
Kurisu: But what if it fails!?
UNSPOKEN: I ignore her and put on the headgear. Moeka’s last shot grazed the side of my head. My ears are still ringing, and there’s blood on my neck. It doesn’t matter. I might fail. I might even die. But I have to try. It’s my only chance to save Mayuri. Kurisu bites her lip and activates the X68000.
Suzuha: Okabe Rintaro! One of them’s moving!
Moeka: Get in there! Kill them!
Attacker A: Damn... kids!
UNSPOKEN: The crew-cut man staggers into the development room. Acting purely on instinct, I grab Future Gadget No. 4: Moad Snake from the shelf and flick the switch. White smoke instantly fills the room, rendering it impossible to see.
Moeka: Kill them!
Kurisu: Augh!
Rintaro: Kurisu!?
Kurisu: Ugh, gh, Okabe!! Are you sure!? Are you sure about this!? Really!?
