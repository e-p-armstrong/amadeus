UNSPOKEN: Daru clutches his head and falls to his knees, screaming at the top of his lungs. In my arms, Mayuri takes one long, ragged breath. And then...
Mayuri: O...kari...
Kurisu: No... no!
UNSPOKEN: She’s dead. Mayuri’s dead. Again. Her face is covered in blood. Her blood stains my hands. It’s warm.
Moeka: You three come with us. Now. No more warnings. Resist, and we will kill you too.
UNSPOKEN: I hear a voice. But I can’t comprehend what it’s saying. It’s the same. I knew it would be. I let Mayuri die again. Because I didn’t believe my own memories of the future. I lay Mayuri down on the floor. I’m sorry, Mayuri. I’m so sorry... I stand up. Rage takes hold of me once again. I’m helpless to resist. I take one menacing step towards Moeka.
Kurisu: Okabe!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu grabs my hand before I can take another.
Kurisu: You can’t!
Rintaro: Let me go!
Kurisu: You can’t! They’ll kill you!
UNSPOKEN: Moeka’s gun is aimed at my head. Her finger is already on the trigger.
Rintaro: You gonna kill me too!?
Moeka: If you resist.
Kurisu: Please, Okabe, do what she says. Okay? Otherwise, they’ll kill you too.
