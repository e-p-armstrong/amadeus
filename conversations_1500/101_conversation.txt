Rintaro: Is Mayuri there? If she is, let me speak to her!
Luka: Okay. Just a moment please.
Mayuri: Tutturu♪ Mayushii here. What’s up, Okarin?
UNSPOKEN: Finally... I’ve managed to get ahold of Mayuri. This will give us hours to spare.
Rintaro: Where are you now? Yanabayashi Shrine!?
Mayuri: Yup!
Rintaro: I’m headed there now. Whatever you do, don’t move, okay!?
Mayuri: Huh? Why not?
Kurisu: What’s all the commotion?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu’s eyes are half asleep.
Rintaro: Daru. Assistant. Leave right now and get as far from Akiba as you can. But under no circumstances use the train.
Itaru: What? Why?
Rintaro: If you can, go somewhere you don’t normally go, and stay there overnight. Understand?
Itaru: Wait, overnight? So you’re saying we should go to a love hotel and make hanky panky. I understand.
Kurisu: Shut it, perv.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu gets up.
Kurisu: What’s going on, Okabe?
