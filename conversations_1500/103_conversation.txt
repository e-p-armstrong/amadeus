UNSPOKEN: I lift my head and see Kurisu standing there.
Kurisu: So this is where you went. I’ve been looking for you.
Rintaro: ...Christina.
Kurisu: What?
Rintaro: What time is it now?
Kurisu: 5:38. Hey. If you have time to sit around, then you can help me with the shopping.
UNSPOKEN: Shopping... Oh, right. Preparations for the party. In the original timeline, I went shopping with Kurisu at the UPX supermarket. And then we talked on this bridge, just like now. It feels like so long ago. Back then, I had no idea what was about to happen.
Kurisu: Well? Are you going to come along or not?
UNSPOKEN: I sigh deeply. I don’t believe that it was wrong to time leap. However...
Rintaro: Kurisu.
UNSPOKEN: I keep my eyes lowered.
Kurisu: ...That’s the first time you’ve said my name properly.
UNSPOKEN: I feel her eyes on me.
Rintaro: ...Help me.
UNSPOKEN: I can’t save Mayuri alone. I realize that now. Reliving today again and again, only to taste the same despair each time, has taught me one important lesson. Alone, I am powerless. Alone, I have no hope.
Rintaro: Help me...
Kurisu: Tell me what happened. I know you used the Time Leap Machine.
Rintaro: ...What?
UNSPOKEN: I look up in surprise. Kurisu doesn’t meet my stare. Instead, she leans on the guard rail and gazes down at the plaza with her usual frown.
Kurisu: You get a phone call, and suddenly you’re like a different person. It was obvious.
Rintaro: I came from three hours in the future.
Kurisu: What happened?
Rintaro: They... killed Mayuri.
UNSPOKEN: I lower my head, trying to hold back the tears. Then I explain about SERN and Moeka, and about how Kurisu herself activated the Time Leap Machine and made this possible. I tell her about my previous leaps. I explain that the world itself wants Mayuri dead, that I can’t save her no matter how I try. I keep talking for thirty minutes straight. During that time, Kurisu hardly says a word.
Rintaro: ...It’s all my fault.
UNSPOKEN: Talking to Kurisu lets me sort out everything I’ve done. Everything I’ve seen.
Rintaro: I shouldn’t have told Daru to hack SERN. I shouldn’t have asked you to build a time machine. I shouldn’t have made Moeka a lab mem. Mayuri’s death... is all my fault.
UNSPOKEN: That’s why I needed to bear the burden myself.  I was resolved to do whatever it took to save Mayuri, never faltering, never giving up. And yet, my resolve has already crumbled.
Kurisu: If you know that Mayuri’s going to die, then what are you doing wasting time here?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu’s tone is haughty. Is this how I sound when I’m playing Hououin Kyouma?
Rintaro: ...I just don’t get it anymore.
Kurisu: What don’t you get?
Rintaro: How to save Mayuri.
Kurisu: Based on what you said, I guess the chronology protection conjecture is true.
Rintaro: No matter what I do, Mayuri dies.
Kurisu: And that’s why you keep time leaping... There’s no guarantee that the machine is safe, you know.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu lowers her gaze and cups her chin, as she often does when assessing a problem.
Kurisu: Even if the machine works perfectly, repeated use may have serious side effects. For example, you may become disconnected from causality itself. You need to understand the risks if you’re going to continue.
Rintaro: Disconnected from causality, meaning?
Kurisu: It happens all the time in sci-fi. You’ll become trapped in a closed time loop, never aging, never dying, but doomed to repeat the same day for all eternity. Worst case, you may cease to exist entirely.
UNSPOKEN: What?
Kurisu: Every trace of your existence will vanish. Nobody will remember you, because your life will have never happened. Leaping through time is that dangerous.
Rintaro: ’Humans are temporal beings.’
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks surprised.
Kurisu: Heidegger. I was thinking of that quote too.
Rintaro: I heard it from you first.
Kurisu: When?
Rintaro: This isn’t the first time I’ve leaped.
Kurisu: Right. Of course.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu squats next to me, thinking deeply.
Kurisu: If what you said is true, then I want to save Mayuri too. But as the co-creator of the Time Leap Machine, I can’t recommend its continued use. Will you listen to my advice?
Rintaro: I...
UNSPOKEN: I can’t do it alone. I know that now.
Rintaro: I need your help. I have to save Mayuri! I can’t do it alone, but together, we might have a chance. I want... I need to believe that! Please, lend me your strength.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu sighs.
Kurisu: You’re such a stubborn fool. What you’ve been through... I’m surprised it hasn’t broken you already.
UNSPOKEN: Incredibly, she sounds concerned about me. She looks at me for a moment, then turns away as if embarrassed.
Kurisu: I’ll help. Mayuri’s my friend, and a fellow lab mem. And besides... I don’t want to see you in such pain.
Rintaro: I’m sorry.
Kurisu: Don’t apologize. Remember when I told you about my father? You really helped me out back then. Now it’s my turn to return the favor. I want to be your strength. Besides, you still have to come with me to Aomori.
UNSPOKEN: She smiles a wry but gentle smile, as if I were her mischievous younger brother.
Kurisu: I know you’re going to leap no matter what I say. You are a mad scientist, after all, and mad scientists play by their own rules. Hey. Aren’t you supposed to go ’muhahahaha’ or something?
Rintaro: Yeah...
Kurisu: Why do I even try?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu is right. I’ll do anything to save Mayuri.
Kurisu: Anyway, I’m not doing this for you, okay? I’m doing it for Mayuri.
Rintaro: Yeah, of course.
Kurisu: That, and I think you’ll make a good test subject.
Rintaro: Now you’re talking like SERN.
Kurisu: It’s completely different.
Rintaro: How so?
Kurisu: I only experiment on you. Besides, mad scientists experiment on themselves all the time, don’t they?
Rintaro: I guess...
UNSPOKEN: I’m no longer afraid to time leap. I’ll do anything to save Mayuri.
Kurisu: I-it’s just a joke. Don’t take it so seriously.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu stands up and looks at her watch.
Kurisu: There’s not much time. I think you should have a clear plan before trying to change the future again.
Rintaro: Meaning?
Kurisu: Leap to an even earlier time. Then explain the situation to me again.
