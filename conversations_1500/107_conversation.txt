UNSPOKEN: Kurisu? Why Kurisu? I’ll guess I’ll find out if I let Suzuha talk. We should head back to the lab. But first... I offer Suzuha my handkerchief. She looks at me for a second, then takes it and ties it around her burned hand.
Suzuha: ...Thanks.
UNSPOKEN: She should probably see a doctor about her hand, but there’s no time for that. Mayuri’s death is approaching. I just hope she’s not in too much pain. I wrap a towel around her hand to keep people around us from staring.
Mayuri: Welcome back, Okarin! Oh! Suzu-san’s with you too♪
UNSPOKEN: When we get to the lab, Mayuri and Daru are there for some reason. I thought I sent them home! Mayuri gives me a ditzy answer when I ask them.
Mayuri: I really thought we should celebrate the birth of Super PhoneWave-chan! So Daru-kun and I went shopping♪
UNSPOKEN: I should have known she wouldn’t stay away. Kurisu looks as worried as I am. She leans close and whispers into my ear.
Kurisu: W-what do we do?
Rintaro: Make absolutely sure Mayuri doesn’t find out.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu nods slightly.
Itaru: What are you guys whispering about?
Kurisu: Um...
