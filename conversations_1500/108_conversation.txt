Rintaro: We’re not playing around here, Daru.
Mayuri: What year were you born?
Suzuha: 2017.
Mayuri: That’s in seven years... You haven’t been born yet, but you’re here. Uh... huh???
UNSPOKEN: There’s no time to deal with Mayuri’s confusion.
Rintaro: Alright, Suzuha. Let’s hear it.
Suzuha: Well, the gist is what I posted on @channel. I came from future, the year 2036. In my time, the world is a dystopia ruled by SERN. There’s no war, no conflict, but no freedom either.
Mayuri: Diss-tope-ear?
Kurisu: A society where every activity is controlled by the government. In a dystopia, you’re not allowed to eat bananas unless today is banana-eating day. If you break that rule, they throw you in jail without a trial.
Mayuri: That’s terrible! Mayushii loves bananas...
UNSPOKEN: Forget about the bananas.
Suzuha: I’m part of the Resistance fighting to free humanity from SERN’s control. I came to the past to change my present. From your point of view, I guess I should say the future. To change the future.
UNSPOKEN: Change the future... She doesn’t sound like she’s joking.
Mayuri: Um, what about finding your father? Was that a lie?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha doesn’t answer. Does that mean it was a lie?
Kurisu: SERN is a research institution. They don’t have political power. I explained that to John Titor several times online.
UNSPOKEN: ...Online?
Rintaro: ...Wait, don’t tell me. You’re ’KuriGohan and Kamehameha’!?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu turns red and looks away.
Kurisu: Titor came forward, so it’s only fair that I do too.
