Kurisu: Apotheosized?
Itaru: In Japanese, please.
Suzuha: Apotheosized. As in revered, respected.
UNSPOKEN: She keeps using unusual vocabulary. Or maybe that’s normal vocabulary in 2036?
Kurisu: Respected? Huh!? I-I am!?
Suzuha: In 2010, you pioneer time leap technology. Afterwards, you contribute to the development of SERN’s time machine. That’s what I know about Makise Kurisu.
UNSPOKEN: Is that why she treats Kurisu like an enemy?
Rintaro: Then I must be the father of the time machine, right?
Suzuha: Okabe Rintaro is a terrorist in 2036. You’re pretty infamous.
Rintaro: Wha...
UNSPOKEN: Seriously? I’m a terrorist in the future!?
Kurisu: I help SERN build their time machine? I don’t believe it. SERN experiments on people against their will. They’re a disgrace to scientists everywhere. I would never collaborate with them.
Suzuha: But that’s how it is in the future.
Kurisu: How did the future me explain herself?
Suzuha: We’ve never met. By 2036, you’re already dead... sorry.
Kurisu: Well... that’s just great. I don’t even make it to fifty?
Suzuha: In my time, there are two kinds of people: those who live extremely long lives, and those who die young, under suspicious circumstances. People who act against SERN are erased.
Kurisu: T-they erased me?
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha looks into Kurisu’s eyes. For once, she’s not glaring at Kurisu.
Suzuha: ...Maybe you were being used by SERN too. Maybe they took your parents hostage and forced you to work on their time machine.
Kurisu: No... does that mean Mama’s in danger?
