UNSPOKEN: She has a point. Everyone looks to Suzuha.
Suzuha: ...It was written in Dad’s will.
UNSPOKEN: His will?
Mayuri: What do you mean?
Suzuha: His will was what made me decide to time travel. My dad was one of the founding members of the Resistance. He hid from SERN and researched time travel on his own. He wanted to change the future. But SERN killed him. That’s why I’m here. To fulfill his dream.
Kurisu: ...I’m sorry.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha doesn’t look at Kurisu. She still seems to have a grudge against her. Kurisu would never actively cooperate with SERN. I know that, but I just can’t say it in front of Suzuha. For some reason, Suzuha really does see Kurisu as responsible for the problems of the future. But if that’s the case, why doesn’t Suzuha just kill Kurisu? Wouldn’t that change the future too? Maybe she can’t. Worldlines converge. No matter how hard I struggle, Mayuri dies. Similarly, it may be impossible for Suzuha to kill Kurisu... no matter how much she may want to. Suzuha clears her throat as if to change the subject.
Suzuha: Akihabara, 2010. The time machine created here accelerates SERN’s own time machine research. We have to stop that from happening in order to guide history in a new direction.
Itaru: Stop it? How?
Rintaro: SERN already knows about us.
UNSPOKEN: That’s clear from Moeka’s attack.
Suzuha: Dad believed that the ultimate cause was the very first email you sent with your time machine.
Rintaro: An email? It wasn’t because they caught us hacking?
Itaru: Like I said, nobody can catch my hacking.
Kurisu: Which email are you talking about?
Mayuri: Um, I know! Wasn’t it the email Okarin sent that said Chris-chan died?
UNSPOKEN: Right. The email I sent to Daru right after Doctor Nakabachi’s conference.
Kurisu: Oh, that...
