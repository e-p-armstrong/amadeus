UNSPOKEN: Daru’s observation startles me. It’s an obvious thing to wonder about, but it strikes too close to home.
Mayuri: Well, Mayushii’s a lab mem, but I can’t make time machines, and I don’t like fighting. Of course I’m not famous!
UNSPOKEN: ...No. The reason there aren’t any stories about Mayuri is because she dies in a few hours. Only Kurisu, Suzuha, and I know that, and we say nothing.
Mayuri: But Daru-kun’s a super hacka and Okarin’s right arm. He even helped Okarin make PhoneWave-chan. So I thought it was strange Suzu-san didn’t know him.
Kurisu: So you’re saying he used a different name?
Mayuri: Barrel Titor-san helped Okarin found the Resistance, right? And he was in Akiba in 2010. And he was able to build his own time machine. And he knew about Okarin’s Reading Spaghetti--
Rintaro: Reading Steiner.
Mayuri: He knew about it. Doesn’t that fit Daru-kun perfectly?
Kurisu: She’s right.
