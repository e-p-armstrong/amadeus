UNSPOKEN: Mayuri’s voice is choked with tears.
Mayuri: Our memories with Suzu-san will disappear! Is that really okay?
UNSPOKEN: Memories flash through my head.
Suzuha: Being with you guys, even for just a little while... was great. I’m going to finish what you started, Dad. I promise. Well, see you in 35 years... though I guess it’ll only be a few hours for you guys. Ahaha! Change the future. Please.
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha, I’ve made my choice. I won’t ask for your forgiveness. Ultimately, I’m doing this to save Mayuri. But at the same time, the words you spoke on that rooftop are still strong in my heart. You entrusted to me your hope for the future. If I am to honor that wish, and fulfill mine, then the time we spent together... can never have happened. I can’t. I can’t do it. I can’t send this D-Mail. Acting on impulse, I don the headgear and punch in a 48-hour time leap.
Kurisu: Do you have a plan?
