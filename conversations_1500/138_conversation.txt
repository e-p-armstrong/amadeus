UNSPOKEN: Where are the family restaurants in Akiba?
Kurisu: Arrive at the meeting place at least 15 minutes early. Tardiness is unacceptable.
Rintaro: 15 minutes early...
Kurisu: Then you just need to decide where to take her. Movies, art galleries, strolling through town, and food are all safe.
Rintaro: I see. It’s easier than I thought. I was under the impression that a first date required going to a beautiful beach resort, exchanging your first kiss bathed in the light of the setting sun, and stuff like that.
Kurisu: Ah, that’s really romantic! ...I mean, that’s virgin imagination at full throttle. You’ve read too much manga.
Rintaro: You too.
Kurisu: Besides, your date’s a minor, so don’t even think about bringing her to a hotel, okay?
Rintaro: ...What do you take me for?
UNSPOKEN: That way lie... forbidden lusts. Not to mention, Lukako’s such an innocent girl. If I brought her to a hotel, she’d probably faint from shock.
Kurisu: That just about covers it. Well? Was my lecture helpful?
