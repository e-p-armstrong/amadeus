UNSPOKEN: Kurisu and I stare in shocked silence. Neither of us can move a muscle.
Nae: Okabe Rintaro.
UNSPOKEN: My heart skips a beat. I feel like someone just walked over my grave.
Nae: I’ll come for you in fifteen years. I hope you spend them quivering in terror. Aha! Ahaha!
UNSPOKEN: Nae tosses the knife away and leaves, laughing all the while. I hear the sound of her footsteps pattering down the stairs. Soon they fade away, leaving us in silence.
Rintaro: Wh-what the hell was that? A demon? Was she possessed?
UNSPOKEN: My entire body is shaking. I have to struggle just to move a finger.
Rintaro: W-what about Moeka!?
UNSPOKEN: Moeka’s clothes are soaked in blood. There’s a gaping wound in her abdomen where Nae stabbed her.
Kurisu: Calm down!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu yells for me to come to my senses, and then she takes out her phone.
Kurisu: Check on Kiryu-san! I’ll call an ambulance. No, wait! Before that... Maybe you should just send the D-Mail.
