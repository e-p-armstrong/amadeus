Kurisu: But there’s a chance I’m right. So you have nothing to worry about.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu smiles. How can she smile? I just told her that she’s going to die.
Kurisu: The problem is that you don’t want to let me die, right? But if my hypothesis is correct, I’ll still be alive on another possible worldline. So there’s no reason to be afraid.
Rintaro: It’s just a hypothesis.
Kurisu: The same is true of attractor fields. It hasn’t been proven. Even if someone did prove it by 2036, that doesn’t help us here in the present. In other words... Anything is possible.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu turns her back to me after finishing. It’s an armchair theory. A daring armchair theory that could, quite possibly, render meaningless everything I’ve done up to now. How can Kurisu stay so calm? She’s just an 18-year-old girl.
Kurisu: You really don’t have to worry about me, Okabe. It would just hurt my pride if you did.
Rintaro: Don’t say it like that.
Kurisu: Your phone’s ringing.
Rintaro: Oh, yeah. It’s Mayuri.
Kurisu: Answer it. I don’t mind.
