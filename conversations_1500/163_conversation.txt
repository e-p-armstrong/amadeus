Kurisu: Listen, Okabe. You can’t save both of us. Correct? No matter how you struggle, it’s one or the other.
Rintaro: But...
Kurisu: No buts. My answer won’t change. Save Mayuri.
UNSPOKEN: I hear the pain in her voice... and also the resolve. Kurisu has made up her mind. I look away and clench my fists. My nails dig into the palms of my hands.
Rintaro: Are you telling me to give up!? To abandon you!? I could never do that!
Kurisu: You can, and you must! There’s no other way.
Rintaro: No! You’re our friend! I won’t abandon you!
Kurisu: Okabe!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu drops to her knees and grabs me by the collar. I gasp for breath as she stares into my eyes. Her eyes are hard and stern. It’s always like this when she scolds me. Always the same glare...
Kurisu: Is there another solution? There isn’t, is there? I don’t want to live if it means sacrificing Mayuri! If you don’t save her, I’ll never forgive you!
Rintaro: Guh...
UNSPOKEN: This can’t be happening! I hate this choice with no right answer. I hate the universe for being so cruel. And most of all, I hate myself for forcing Kurisu to speak these words when she is the one with the most to lose. Tears well up in my eyes, but I bite my lip and hold them back. Is there really no other way? I can’t bear it. I look straight back at Kurisu as she holds me by the collar...
Kurisu: Eh...?
UNSPOKEN: And tightly embrace her slender body. Her clothes are still wet from the rain, but all I feel is warmth radiating from the core of her being.
Rintaro: But you’re right here! Why does it have to be this way!?
Kurisu: Okabe...
UNSPOKEN: Tension drains from her back and her hands. She gives her whole body to my embrace.
Kurisu: Thank you. I know you’re hurting for me. But you’ve done enough. I’m fine, so just think about Mayuri, okay?
UNSPOKEN: Despite her fear, Kurisu has made her choice. It’s time for me to do the same. I need to decide, here and now. The future of the world. Which friend to let die. Holding Kurisu tightly, I whisper into her ear...
Rintaro: I won’t give up. Ever!
Kurisu: ...Kuh!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu suddenly pushes me away. She steps back. Her face is hidden behind her hair. But her fists are trembling. Her body exudes raw fury.
Kurisu: This is ridiculous! You... motherfucker!
Rintaro: Whoa!
Kurisu: I said I was fine! What do you mean you won’t give up!? Are you stupid? Wanna die? Are you trying to be a hero, you chuunibyou wackjob? Don’t make promises you can’t keep! Your stupidity is infuriating! Why can’t you just do as I say!?
Rintaro: I...
Kurisu: What’s the problem, huh!? If you weigh the options logically, saving Mayuri is the only--
Rintaro: Fuck logic!
Kurisu: ...!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu stares at me in shock.
Rintaro: I’m not God! Maybe I got close, but that’s not me! I can’t decide who lives and who dies anymore!
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha. Faris. Lukako. I sacrificed their happiness to save Mayuri. And the whole time, a voice in the back of my head was asking... Is this really okay? What gives me the right?
Rintaro: This time...
UNSPOKEN: This time, I want to save both of them, without sacrificing anyone.
Kurisu: Hmph!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu turns away with a frown, then starts tapping her foot in a clear gesture of displeasure.
Kurisu: There’s nothing you can do. It’s the choice of Steins Gate. Isn’t that what you always say? The equation is proven, Okabe. There’s no escape. You’re just one man. No matter how hard you try, you can’t overcome the will of the universe.
Rintaro: I know... but I’m still going to try!
UNSPOKEN: I won’t lose Mayuri or Kurisu.
Kurisu: Kuh...
UNSPOKEN: I hear Kurisu grinding her teeth. Then she turns her back to me.
Kurisu: Have it your way! But I’m not helping. I’m going back to America, and that’s that. Goodbye. I don’t expect we’ll meet again, Hououin Kyouma.
Rintaro: Kuh...
Kurisu: I can’t believe this! How stupid can you be? You’re so... stupid!
