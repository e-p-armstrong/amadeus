UNSPOKEN: Kurisu puts her fingers to her brow and shakes her head in an exaggerated gesture.
Kurisu: Geez... I feel like I'm hypersecreting noradrenaline. Let me pick my jaw up off the floor.
Rintaro: I don't care about your dislocated jaw! Do you accept the conditions or not? Answer me, Christina!
Kurisu: Stop adding -tina! My name's Kurisu!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks up at the ceiling to calm herself down. Does everyone in America make such exaggerated gestures? Sooner or later, she'll say Dayumn! or Oh mah gah! or Muthafucka!.
Kurisu: ...Okay. I accept.
Rintaro: Hehehe, good answer. From this moment forth, you are Lab Mem Number 004. Welcome, Christina -- codename, The Zombie!
Kurisu: I won't answer to either. Use my real name, Hououin.
UNSPOKEN: We spend a minute staring each other down. Kurisu's the first to look away. She does so in a way that says good grief.
Kurisu: You're such a child.
Rintaro: You say something? Genius perv girl?
Kurisu: Come on! No more saying 'perv'! I won't treat you like a perv either! So let's drop it already!
Rintaro: As long as you understand. Now for the issue at hand. Daru, give Christina--
Kurisu: No '-tina' either.
Rintaro: Give Kurisu-kun an explanation on our experiments so far.
Itaru: But I refuse.
UNSPOKEN: In the end, I'm the one who has to explain. Along the way, I also relate the tale of my heroic deeds -- which enrages Kurisu, of course -- but I finally tell her everything about the bananas and the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Kurisu doesn't ask any questions. She's quick to understand, as expected of a genius.
Kurisu: Fascinating.
Rintaro: Let's hear your opinion.
Kurisu: I think we can at least throw out completely worthless theories like electromagnetic weaponry and teleportation.
UNSPOKEN: The lady doth protest too much.
Kurisu: Can we run the experiment one more time? I want to see it for myself.
UNSPOKEN: Without waiting for our approval, Kurisu plucks an untouched banana and sticks it in the microwave, then starts entering the commands on her phone. It's strange. She's still wearing her usual frown, but I can't shake the feeling that she's really enjoying herself. I can't put my finger on why. Call it a hunch. But I mean, she is a scientist. Why shouldn't she enjoy experimenting?
Kurisu: Okabe-san, Hashida-san, please watch the bananas.
Rintaro: Who are you to give me orders? I am the mad scientist, Houou--
Kurisu: Whatever. Just keep your eye on the bananas!
UNSPOKEN: Okay, so she's a little snippy. Daru and I do as we're told and stare at the bananas. Truth be told, we were planning to watch the bananas anyway. After missing it the first time, we're determined to witness what transpired with our own eyes.
Kurisu: Sixty seconds have passed. Any change?
Itaru: Nope.
UNSPOKEN: Any second now, the gelified banana should reappear on the stem. If it only happens once, we can just call it an accident and be done with it. But if it happens twice, then that's proof that something's actually going on.  And then, Kurisu will have to admit that I, the great Hououin Kyouma, have invented humanity's first teleporter! I keep staring at the bananas in anticipation.
Kurisu: 100 seconds.
