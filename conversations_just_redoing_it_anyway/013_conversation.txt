UNSPOKEN: Once she notices Kurisu, Mayuri bows her head with her usual smile.
Mayuri: I'm Mayushii. Nice to meet you!
Kurisu: I'm Makise. Apparently, I'm a lab mem now.
Mayuri: Really? That's great! Another girl lab mem!
Rintaro: Daru, what were you doing with the X68000?
Itaru: Like I said, I was adjusting the incoming mail settings. I was monitoring the moment it received mail for remote control. That's why I put it on 'freezing mode' for 120 seconds too. I made it so that you can start freezing mode by computer. I tested that out yesterday too.
Rintaro: Mayuri! Insert the Juicy Chicken Number One into the PhoneWave (name subject to change)!
Mayuri: You all want some? I can give you one each.
UNSPOKEN: With her usual ditziness, Mayuri puts the chicken inside the microwave. Daru explains what everything on the computer monitor means. Doesn't look that different from using DOS. I enter 120# on the keyboard and strike the enter key. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) starts up. The Juicy Chicken Number One starts spinning backwards on the turntable. Kurisu stares hard at the PhoneWave (name subject to change), as if to not let any anomaly, no matter how slight, escape her notice.
Rintaro: So, we've reproduced the conditions that existed when the discharge phenomenon occurred. Right?
Itaru: Uhh, how was it again...
Rintaro: You there. Assistant!
Kurisu: Huh? Me?
Rintaro: Who else!?
Kurisu: When did I become your assistant!?
Rintaro: Just send something to my phone!
UNSPOKEN: If we've reproduced the conditions correctly, then if she sends something to my phone while it's connected to the PhoneWave (name subject to change), it should arrive with a timestamp from the past, not the present. But my assistant -- Kurisu -- just scowls.
Kurisu: I don't even know your email address.
Rintaro: What a useless assistant.
Kurisu: Don't call me your assistant!
Rintaro: Daru, send an email from your phone!
Itaru: Uh, sure... but what?
Rintaro: Anything!
Itaru: Uhh, umm...
Rintaro: Send 'Christina's a perv'!
Kurisu: I thought we agreed to stop saying that!
Itaru: Well, let's compromise and go with 'Okarin's a perv'.
Rintaro: You traitor!
Kurisu: Good job, Hashida-san!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu grins and gives Daru a thumbs up. I really don't like this.
Mayuri: Oh no! Mayushii's bananas!
UNSPOKEN: It sounds like Mayuri has found the results of our latest experiment.
Mayuri: They became gelbanas...
Kurisu: We experimented on them.
Mayuri: But they were Mayushii's...
Itaru: Want me to send the mail now?
Kurisu: You'll be reimbursed later. By Hououin-san, that is.
Rintaro: Why me!?
Mayuri: Geez! Why do you always have to experiment on Mayushii's food? Ah! Don't tell me you're experimenting on the chicken too?
Rintaro: We are.
Itaru: 'Kay, sending it now. Sending, sending, click.
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri slips past me and steps up to the active PhoneWave (name subject to change). Before anyone can react, she grabs the handle--
Rintaro: Wait! Don't open that!
Mayuri: Huh?
UNSPOKEN: But it's too late.
Mayuri: Wawah!
UNSPOKEN: Blue-white light fills the room, crackling angrily like the heart of a storm.
Kurisu: An electrical discharge!
UNSPOKEN: A violent sparking sound. I grab Mayuri and pull her away from the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Itaru: Are we gonna die!?
UNSPOKEN: A thin cloud of smoke fills the room. It smells like something's burning. My eyes are numb from all the flashing light. I try blinking several times to regain my sight. I can hear Kurisu and Daru coughing.
Rintaro: E-everyone okay?
Itaru: S-somehow.
Kurisu: That was definitely more than two seconds.
