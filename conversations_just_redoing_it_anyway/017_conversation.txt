Kurisu: Hey. When did I become your assistant?
UNSPOKEN: She looks like she'll snap at me, so to dampen her spirit, I go back to checking my email. What is wrong with this woman!? I told her to tell me her phone number and she just ignored me! And she doesn't even have any information! How useless can you be!?
Kurisu: ...Why are you glaring at me?
Rintaro: Don't worry about it. You're not the cause of my frustration.
Kurisu: Oh, so you're just raging? Don't glare at me.
Rintaro: You've glared at me before, haven't you?
Kurisu: That's because you keep doing pervy-- Ah, no, I'm not saying anything.
UNSPOKEN: Another one? I want to snap my phone in half and throw it on the ground. What do you mean Tell me the super hacka's address♪!? You making fun of me with that ♪? You're not getting anything from me! Anyway, why does she need to send me two short consecutive emails? I mean, she might as well just combine them into one.
Kurisu: Are the emails you're getting really that unpleasant?
Rintaro: They're more... unreasonable than unpleasant.
UNSPOKEN: I can't quite describe it in one word. Stop sending me all these short emails! I'm begging you, just gather your thoughts and send everything together! I feel a little satisfied after sending that email. I turn to Kurisu again.
Rintaro: So, Christina, what brings you here?
Kurisu: If you're going to call me names, could you at least be consistent? Anyway, my business here doesn't concern you.
Rintaro: Why are you pouting?
Kurisu: I'm not pouting. I just don't want to get involved in your silly games again.
Rintaro: Nonsense. You're already a lab mem. You have a duty to work for the benefit of the lab!
UNSPOKEN: Well, she is only a temporary member. No, it's because she's a temporary member that we need to get as much out of her as we can.
Kurisu: ...I regret losing myself to curiosity back then.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu sighs and looks up at the satellite. We're not alone. Several other people are standing here and looking up. It's Akiba's latest tourist attraction.
Rintaro: Did you come to see the satellite?
Kurisu: ...I guess. It doesn't make sense. Normally, they calculate satellites' orbits so that they burn up in the atmosphere when they fall. So how can that thing be in such perfect condition?
UNSPOKEN: And that's to say nothing about the huge hole it punched in the building. Are satellites that durable?
Rintaro: Where's this satellite from, anyway?
Kurisu: They still don't know. Rumors say it's from the former Soviet Union, but Russia denies it. So it looks like they can't remove it yet.
UNSPOKEN: Three days have passed and it's still unknown. How interesting. I smell a conspiracy.
Rintaro: So it's another Organization cover-up! They knew I'd be at Radi-Kan and tried to erase me!
Kurisu: Organization? What's that?
Rintaro: The Organization is the Organization. Its formal name is something else, but all those who know of its existence call it the Organization out of fear. They rule the world from the shadows, transcending nations, with politics, economics, religion, even science in their clutches.
Kurisu: That's obviously a crackpot conspiracy theory, thank you very mu--
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu hangs her head and blushes for some reason.
Rintaro: What's wrong?
Kurisu: N-nothing! Really, nothing, okay? Say another word and I hit you!
UNSPOKEN: Crazy girl.
Kurisu: A-anyway! What's happened with the PhoneWave!?
Rintaro: I thought you didn't want to get involved. And it's not the PhoneWave, it's the PhoneWave (name subject to change)--
Kurisu: Just answer me. Have you learned anything?
Rintaro: No progress. We've tried repeating the experiment, but at present, we haven't been able to reproduce the discharge phenomenon or send another email to the past.
Kurisu: I see...
