UNSPOKEN: Mayuri, oblivious as always, puffs out her chest with pride. But I don't miss Kurisu's relieved sigh. She keeps dropping manga quotes. Does this mean what I think it means?
Mayuri: Without Mayushii's info, Okarin would still be lost on the streets of Akiba.
Rintaro: Mayuri's right. She did well this time.
Mayuri: Ehehe! Anyway, it's time for Mayushii to go home. What about you, Chris-chan? Wanna go together?
Kurisu: Thanks. But I'm going to stay here a little longer.
