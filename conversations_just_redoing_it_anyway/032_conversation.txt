UNSPOKEN: I point to the X68000. There's code on the screen.
Rintaro: It's in terminal mode now. We can change the factory settings like this, make the microwave do things its manufacturer never intended.
Kurisu: How was it set when the discharge phenomenon occurred?
Rintaro: Nothing out of the ordinary. It was at factory settings.
Kurisu: Hmm. I'll take a banana.
UNSPOKEN: The bunch of bananas only has three bananas left.
Rintaro: Those are Mayuri's.
Kurisu: Oh, so I don't need your permission, then. I'll go buy new bananas tomorrow.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu takes one banana from the bunch, squats down, and places it inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change). She begins to type on her phone. She pushes send, and the PhoneWave (name subject to change) begins to turn backwards. After 120 seconds, the chime rings.
Kurisu: ...Nothing happened.
UNSPOKEN: The banana's still in the microwave, un-gelified.
Kurisu: Ow!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu yelps as she tries to take out the banana, and quickly draws back her hand. She starts blowing on her fingers.
Kurisu: It's hot.
Rintaro: Meaning the microwave functioned normally.
UNSPOKEN: This proves that the hidden function Mayuri found wasn't a freezing function. But we knew that already. Undaunted, Kurisu throws in a new banana, and once again begins reverse rotation for 120 seconds. But the second banana warms up too. We can't reproduce the gelification phenomenon, much less send mail to the past.
Rintaro: What does this mean...
Kurisu: I guess what happened earlier was an irregularity after all.
Rintaro: I don't know if it's an irregularity or not, but we ought to investigate the cause.
Kurisu: I agree.
UNSPOKEN: We agree for once. But Kurisu's motives and my motives are probably the exact opposite. My assistant here wants to disprove my theory that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is, in fact, a time machine.
Rintaro: In the previous experiment... After spending 120 seconds in the PhoneWave (name subject to change), the banana teleported back to the bunch gelified. We should consider that it returned to its state 120 seconds before.
Kurisu: Wrong. If it returned to its state 120 seconds before, it wouldn't be gelified.
UNSPOKEN: So she wants to say that because it was gelified, it didn't travel back in time.
Rintaro: The chicken returned to its frozen state without gelifying.
Kurisu: That logic is dubious. Sure it ended up frozen, but did you examine the possibility that it might have gelified first?
UNSPOKEN: No... I didn't. I think Mayuri ate the refrozen chicken.
Rintaro: Salt didn't gelify.
Kurisu: You mean nothing changed.
Rintaro: After the discharge phenomenon occurred last time, we spent all night experimenting with cabbage, radishes, rice, konjac, melon bread, Crunchy-kun, and cup noodles. Nothing happened. The same thing with liquids. On that day, our success rate took a 180 degree turn. Before the discharge phenomenon, everything succeeded. After the discharge phenomenon, everything failed.
Kurisu: Is the microwave storing electricity? You said that gelified objects became fractal structured, right? Salt has a simple structure by nature, so maybe that had an effect. But how could electricity be related...
Rintaro: Here, we should think under the assumptions of time travel theory.
Kurisu: No. It's not good to start thinking from the conclusion.
Rintaro: We've already had several successful experiments. You can't deny that.
Kurisu: I'm not especially concerned whether this thing is a time machine or not. To begin with, it's physically impossible for this tiny little microwave to produce energy equivalent to the big bang.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu frowns deeply.
Kurisu: We can't reproduce the discharge phenomenon, nor the fractalization. There should be a reason why. We haven't changed our methods. We haven't changed the settings. We haven't changed the experimental subjects either. There must be some other variable.
