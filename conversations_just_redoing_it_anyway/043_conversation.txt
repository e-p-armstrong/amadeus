UNSPOKEN: The three of us probably look pretty haggard since we stayed up all night. But it's hard to put on a bright smile now that I know about SERN.
Mayuri: I'll refresh the air!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri opens the window wide. The sky is so blue, it hurts my eyes. Large clouds listlessly drift on the wind. It truly is a refreshing sight. Mayuri's appearance makes Daru get up with a grimace. Kurisu also finally moves away from the computer, sipping her hot coffee while rubbing her eyes. I glance at the clock, then go to the center of the room and call for attention.
Rintaro: Since all lab mems are present and accounted for, this is the perfect opportunity to hold another Round Table Conference.
Mayuri: Roundabout confluence?
Itaru: ...What's that?
Rintaro: A meeting of lab mems.
Itaru: Have we ever done that before?
Kurisu: Do you even have a round table?
Rintaro: Not physically. However, it exists in the hearts of all lab mems. Am I mistaken?
Kurisu: Yes, you're mistaken. Don't go sticking things in people's hearts.
Mayuri: Is there one in Mayushii too?
Rintaro: Of course there is.
Mayuri: Oh, that's good. But what's a roundable?
Itaru: And why a round table? You King Arthur?
Kurisu: I'm only a temporary lab mem anyway.
UNSPOKEN: These people whine about every little thing!
Rintaro: Anyway, it's a Round Table Conference! Mayuri wasn't here last night, so first, let's explain the situation to her.
UNSPOKEN: I tell Mayuri about everything we discovered in her absence. About how SERN is making a time machine. About jellymen. About how men in black might be coming to erase us for what we know.
Mayuri: I told you you shouldn't do bad things.
Rintaro: Hmph, 'bad' you say? We are bad? Absurd. If we're bad, then SERN is even worse. They aren't satisfied with ruling the world. Now they want to get their hands on space-time itself!
Kurisu: I agree.
UNSPOKEN: For some reason, Kurisu backs me up.
Kurisu: What SERN is doing is unforgivable. They're traitors to humanity, to society, and to science.
Mayuri: I guess...
UNSPOKEN: She doesn't sound convinced. I didn't want to get Mayuri involved, but she's surprisingly perceptive. She'd find out even if we kept it a secret. So it's better to just tell her.
Rintaro: Anyway, Ragnarok can no longer be averted. The final battle with SERN is near.
UNSPOKEN: A large part of me is still afraid, but we've come too far to turn back now. We can't unlearn what we know.
Mayuri: Rag in a rock?
Kurisu: Norse mythology again?
Rintaro: Christina! I ordered you to investigate SERN! What have you learned?
Kurisu: I don't remember being ordered, but whatever. There are two problems SERN faces with time travel. First is the electron injection device, also known as a 'lifter'. Unless they get it to function properly, they can't make the Kerr black hole singularites naked. If you send a test subject through the singularity in its current state, the supergravity compresses them to the micro level. Naturally, there's no way to survive. The second problem is that they can't specify a physical destination. They can't choose where they end up after traveling to the past. That's why I'd say the 14 found jellymen were the lucky ones. Over a hundred human experiments have been performed since 2001. The remaining 80 or so people ended up somewhere they can't be found.
Mayuri: Why can't they be found?
Itaru: Didn't you know, Mayu-shi? The world is constantly moving. Its rotational speed is 1500 kph, and its orbital speed is 114, 000 kph--
UNSPOKEN: Daru's tone is authoritative, but he's just relaying what he heard from Kurisu last night.
Kurisu: SERN has been looking for solutions, but it's not going well.
