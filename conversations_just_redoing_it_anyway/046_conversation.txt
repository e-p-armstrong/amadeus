Kurisu: First, let's see if it'll become a jellyman. Agh!
UNSPOKEN: She tries to get up and gloriously bangs her head underneath the table.
Rintaro: Trying for the clumsy girl appeal?
Kurisu: It was an accident!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu gets up, blushing in embarrassment with tears in her eyes.
Kurisu: Put the microwave somewhere else! It's dangerous and hard to reach like this.
Rintaro: It'll punch through the floor if we put it on the table.
Mayuri: Chris-chan, Chris-chan! Pain, pain, go awayâ™ª
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri pats the back of Kurisu's head, then sweeps her hand through the air.
Kurisu: Thanks, Mayuri-san.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu pulls herself together, types on her phone, and activates the PhoneWave (name subject to change). The banana inside the microwave slowly begins to spin backwards as the timer counts down.
Kurisu: Ah!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu, who is peering into the microwave, suddenly shouts in surprise. The banana has vanished. At the exact same moment, the banana reappears on its stem, gelified.
Itaru: Whoa!
Mayuri: It became a gelbana...
Rintaro: Heh heh heh... muhahaha... MUHAHAHAHA! Just as I suspected, the critical variable was time!
UNSPOKEN: I was a little anxious about the result, but it all worked out. I outwitted the impertinent genius girl. Now my position as symbol of the lab is secure!
Kurisu: W-way to go, Okabe. It was so simple, I didn't notice it.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu says with a slightly sulky expression.
Rintaro: Your praise does you credit, Christina, but I know you're frustrated you didn't think of it first. Muhahahaha!
Kurisu: Anyway, let's see if we can send another D-Mail.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu ignores my proud laughter and excitedly starts typing out a mail.
Rintaro: Guh... I feel like my authority has been on the decline since that girl showed up.
Itaru: It's cool, man. You never had any to begin with.
Kurisu: Help me, you two! Okabe, I'm sending an email to your phone.
UNSPOKEN: When did I become her assistant? I grind my teeth in frustration, but I do as I'm told and insert my phone into the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s slot.
Mayuri: What are you gonna send, Chris-chan?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri presses up against Kurisu and sneaks a peek at Kurisu's phone.
Kurisu: It doesn't matter what it says. What matters is whether we can send it or not.
Mayuri: Hmm? Lemme see... Okabe is an airhe...?
Rintaro: Wait! You there, assistant! What are you typing?
Kurisu: You'll see. Ready? I'm sending it.
UNSPOKEN: Daru has already set the microwave's timer through the X68000. There's nothing inside, but the microwave still operates. The countdown starts from 120. This is where the timing counts. We know that we have to open the microwave door during operation, but we still don't know when to send the mail. For now, we'll do them simultaneously. Kurisu readies her finger on her phone's send button. I grasp the microwave's door handle. Mayuri seeks cover.
Itaru: Starting the countdown!
UNSPOKEN: The microwave timer soon indicates 70.
Itaru: 3, 2, 1... zero.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu presses send. And at nearly the same instant, I open the microwave door.
Kurisu: Kya!
Rintaro: MUHAHAHAHA! It's working! It's working, you guys!
UNSPOKEN: Lightning crackles in the air. The cushion underneath the PhoneWave (name subject to change) collapses under the weight. The floor starts creaking. It's exactly like the discharge phenomenon that occurred before! The discharge lasts for about ten seconds. After it subsides, we stare at the PhoneWave (name subject to change) with bated breath. Luckily, it didn't break through the floor.
Kurisu: ...Did it arrive?
