UNSPOKEN: I reply mechanically. My mind is still blank.
Luka: Actually, Okabe-san... I mean, Kyouma-san, there's something I need to apologize for...
UNSPOKEN: What could he have to apologize for? Timidly, Lukako holds out his hand. And there, between his fingers...
Rintaro: Ah...!
UNSPOKEN: Is a LOTO SIX ticket. And the numbers are the same as the ones in my D-Mail! I grab Lukako by his slender wrist.
Rintaro: Where did you get this!?
Luka: T-that hurts...
Mayuri: Don't pick on Luka-kun!
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri gets between us. I let go reluctantly.
Kurisu: What's wrong with you, Okabe? You're acting weird.
