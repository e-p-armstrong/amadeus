UNSPOKEN: I leave Suzuha to her fate and return to the lab. I need to get in touch with Titor as quickly as possible. He might be able to give me the answers I seek. He might even be able to explain the event that I witnessed a few days ago -- the instantaneous disappearance of everyone on the streets of Akiba. When I burst into the lab, everyone looks at me with concerned expressions. Mayuri starts to speak, presumably to console me, but I put my hand up to stop her.
Rintaro: Wait! We'll talk when everything's over.
UNSPOKEN: I explain that we can't experiment anymore now that Mister Braun is back. Then I dismiss everyone for today.
Mayuri: Um, I'll buy more bananas tomorrow, okay?
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri picks her Upa plush toy off the sofa and hands it to me.
Mayuri: So for now, hug this little guy suuuuper tight and cheer up, okay?
UNSPOKEN: Looks like she's worried about me. But she shouldn't be. It's my job to worry about her. She has work after this, so she leaves. Daru goes with her, probably to see Faris. Before he leaves, Lukako apologizes again for messing up the LOTO SIX ticket. He knows about the time machine now. Next time I see him, I'll make him a lab mem to secure his silence. Moeka leaves with nothing more than a tiny bow. In less than 30 minutes, Kurisu and I are the only ones left in the lab.
Rintaro: Hey, assistant. You're not going back to your hotel?
Kurisu: Is there a problem?
Rintaro: No, no problem. I was just wondering what you were still doing here.
Kurisu: Nothing. I just wanted to think for a bit.
Rintaro: Can't you think at your hotel?
Kurisu: What? You're kicking me out?
Rintaro: Ahh, I get it. You'd be lonely in your hotel room, but you have no friends, so you want me, the great Hououin Kyouma, to look after you. Isn't that right, you spoiled Celeb Sev?
Kurisu: You're the lonely one, aren't you? You've been acting gloomy all day. Do you need some advice? I'm an outsider, in a sense, so it should be easier to talk to me, right? A man getting advice from a younger woman is kind of *mumble mumble*, but if you're fine with that, then just ask away.
UNSPOKEN: Why does she have to be such a smart-ass? She even has a mocking grin on her face.
Rintaro: I need to send some emails. If you insist on staying here, then be quiet and stay out of my way. Okay, Zombie?
Kurisu: Of all your stupid names, that one's the worst.
UNSPOKEN: Despite her complaint, Kurisu makes no move to leave. She sits down on the sofa and starts reading a massive technical book. On closer inspection, I realize it's in English. Maybe my assistant isn't a genius, but just an extreme studier.
Rintaro: Want some coffee?
Kurisu: Sure.
UNSPOKEN: I make some instant coffee for Kurisu. I take a fresh Dr P out of the refrigerator for myself and sit down in front of the computer. Alright, let's do what needs to be done. I only hope this doesn't get undone too. My plan is to follow Suzuha's advice. Get in touch with Titor. After all, what I'm experiencing right now could have something to do with the many-worlds interpretation. Which would mean that the Kurisu sitting over there isn't the same Kurisu with whom I discussed the LOTO SIX. And it would mean that this lab isn't the lab where we discussed it. How can that be?
Kurisu: What's wrong with you? Stop fidgeting.
