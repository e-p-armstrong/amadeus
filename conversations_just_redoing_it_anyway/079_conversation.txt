Kurisu: Do you always stay the night here?
Rintaro: Pretty much. I wouldn't be a true mad scientist if I couldn't stay overnight at my lab, immersed in research.
Kurisu: I think you're putting too much emphasis on appearances.
Mayuri: But you know, this place is really convenient. Mayushii would stay over if mom and dad let me.
Kurisu: Y-you would?
Mayuri: And it's so close to work too♪ Hey, Chris-chan, why don't we all stay over some time?
Kurisu: Sure, if the guys aren't around.
Rintaro: That won't happen.
Kurisu: Then why don't you come to my hotel, Mayuri-san?
Mayuri: Oh yeah, we did make that promise, huh? Ehehe! Then let's do that next time♪
Kurisu: You can come whenever you like. See you tomorrow.
