UNSPOKEN: We all ignore Daru. Lukako puts his hands to his mouth and casts his eyes down. The same gesture as a (female) junior confessing her love to a (male) senior underneath a cherry tree. Cuteness overload! Must resist!
Luka: I want... to be a girl.
Kurisu: ...What?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu is the first to react. Her expression is one of utter confusion. Well, that's only natural. Not even I expected that, so I accidentally swallowed my muhahaha.
Luka: I don't really... like how I look... I always thought... that if I were a girl... I could be a little more confident...
UNSPOKEN: So he has no confidence in himself. He's prettier than any girl here. And yet, he has no confidence. I'm well aware of the reason for this. It's because he's a guy!
Kurisu: Wait. Wait a second.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu starts rubbing her temples.
Kurisu: Umm, what did she say?
Rintaro: Heh, heh, heh. Assistant mine -- no, Christina!
Kurisu: I'm not your assistant, and I'm not Christina!
Rintaro: You've made a grave error!
Kurisu: I have?
Rintaro: Don't you understand? No, of course you don't. How could you, with impure thoughts clouding your eyes!
Kurisu: Wh-what do you mean?
Rintaro: Allow me to explain. You called Lukako here a 'weak and innocent girl.' But he's not a girl at all. He's a guy!
Kurisu: Is that some kind of joke?
Rintaro: It's not a joke, but the naked truth as described in the Akashic Records! Muhahaha!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks at Daru and Mayuri as if seeking help, but they nod with a knowing look in their eyes. As for Lukako himself, he's just hanging his head in shame.
Kurisu: ...Are you guys trolling me?
Rintaro: Eh?
Itaru: Eh?
Kurisu: ...Eh?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu suddenly turns away as if to avoid my gaze. Then she walks up to Lukako.
Kurisu: Is what Okabe says true?
Luka: Y-yes... I'm... a guy...
Kurisu: N-no way! Someone this cute can't be a boy!
Itaru: You've got it backwards. You're supposed to say 'Someone this cute can't be a girl.'
Kurisu: That's not what I meant.
UNSPOKEN: Does that mean Kurisu knows the meaning of the phrase Someone this cute can't be a girl? So she is an @channeler...
Rintaro: Lukako. You're fine just the way you are. I will not reject you, be you man or be you woman. Nor will anyone else here. And I will not deny your wish. Nor will anyone else here.
Itaru: Why do you keep repeating that last part?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu, unable to calm down after learning the truth, starts touching her own face and checking her hair in her pocket mirror.
Rintaro: Why, Christina. Is it such a shock to meet a man far more feminine than you?
Kurisu: I admit it. Compared to her... I mean, to him, I'm not as cute, I talk more rudely, and my attitude is worse... This is a three-day-coma level shock.
UNSPOKEN: Looks like she's seriously depressed.
Mayuri: Chris-chan's cute tooâ™ª
Kurisu: Don't try to comfort me. It just makes me feel worse.
Rintaro: Admitting your faults is the first step towards becoming stronger. You may one day become a splendid woman, Christina. You're still young.
Kurisu: Who the hell asked you?
Rintaro: I take it back! You're a stubborn fool who refuses to face the truth!
Kurisu: Shut up. I don't want to hear that from you.
Luka: Um... sorry. I shouldn't have said anything.
UNSPOKEN: Lukako bows his head for some reason. His eyes are red and puffy. With such a cute girl -- err, boy -- on the verge of tears, Kurisu and I have no choice but to stop arguing.
Itaru: Welp, better get my trusty digicam...
Kurisu: Don't try to sneak in a photo session, you perv!
