Rintaro: Then that settles it. Lukako, I appoint you Lab Mem 006.
Luka: Eh...?
Rintaro: The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is our lab's most important secret. In order to use it, you must become a lab mem.
Luka: Ah! Okay! Actually... I always wanted to be a lab member.
Mayuri: Really? You should've just said so!
Luka: I didn't have the courage... Like I said, I don't know a thing about gadgets...
Mayuri: You don't have to worry about those things. I mean, Mayuri doesn't get them either.
UNSPOKEN: That's not something to be proud of, Mayuri.
Rintaro: So Lukako shall be a lab mem from this point forth. Any objections?
Kurisu: Here.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu raises her hand.
Kurisu: I want to give Urushibara-san my number so I can retire.
Rintaro: Denied. Anyone else?
Kurisu: ...*sigh*
