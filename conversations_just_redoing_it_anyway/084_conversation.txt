Kurisu: Ah...
UNSPOKEN: Looks like Kurisu and Daru figured it out. Daru goes to google it.
Itaru: Around 1996. There wasn't mail until later, though.
Rintaro: So the year Lukako was born, most people still didn't have cellphones. Lukako's mother may not have had one. In that case, she might not be able to receive the D-Mail!
Mayuri: Oh! I get it!
Luka: Eh...? We can't do it?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako's face darkens. I fold my arms in thought. Some way to receive the email... in an era when cellphones weren't yet widespread...
Itaru: What about modifying it to send crazy waves or something?
Kurisu: What the hell are crazy waves?
Itaru: Waves that only crazy girls can pick up. You know, girls who always talk about stuff no one understands. It's pretty moe.
Kurisu: I'll microwave your brain if you don't shut up.
Itaru: Yes! Abuse me more, please!
Mayuri: Um, couldn't you put a letter in a time capsule and bury it?
Kurisu: That would go to the future, not the past.
Mayuri: Oh...
Itaru: I know! How about that thing where you get struck by lightning and that turns you into a girl! Like in old comics and anime.
Kurisu: There's no point to the experiment if we don't use D-Mail. Don't lose sight of the objective.
Mayuri: We're counting on you for a nice idea, Chris-chanâ™ª
Kurisu: M-me? I... We could... build a rocket which exceeds the speed of light squared, then that immense speed would reverse the flow of time, or something...
Itaru: You're forgetting about the PhoneWave too.
Rintaro: Furthermore, genius girl, you just contradicted relativity.
Kurisu: It was just a joke. Don't take it seriously.
Rintaro: Useless, all of you! This lab is a disgrace!
Kurisu: Fine then. Let's hear from Hououin Kyouma, the insane mad scientist with an IQ over 170 whose brain cells are coveted the world over. What's your genius plan?
