Kurisu: Now we can proceed with the experiment.
Itaru: Luka-shi's girl version... will definitely be moe.
UNSPOKEN: Mayuri, Kurisu, and Daru are already on standby. Sending a D-Mail to a pager. Yesterday, we argued about whether it's even possible. Eventually, we settled on 'probably.' Data is data, after all. The rest depends on the pager radio wave stations 8 years ago, but it should be fine as long as our data gets through safely. We already googled how to send data to a pager. For the pagers back then, you would first enter the other person's pager number, then, if in the Kanto region, enter *2*2. After that, you would enter the numbers to send. That's how it worked, apparently. Pagers in 1992 could still only send numbers. Phone number display functions were also yet to be implemented, so your number was hidden from the other person by default. A few years after that, pagers started to implement Japanese character displays, enabling functionality similar to that of email. Therefore, the D-Mail Lukako's about to send -- it's technically not a mail, though -- has to be sent in numerical form. Naturally, I have a conversion table for that on hand. You can find information even from 18 years ago if you just google it. I was pretty worried by the lack of information on pagers at first, but that's my little secret.
Kurisu: Urushibara-san, you need to think about what to send to your mother in the past.
