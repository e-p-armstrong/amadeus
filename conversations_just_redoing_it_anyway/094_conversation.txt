Kurisu: There was one more. The first mail Okabe accidentally sent that said I was dead.
Rintaro: But from my perspective, we sent several more.
Mayuri: You mean how you sent the winning LOTO SIX numbers? And how Luka-chan bought a ticket with those numbers, but didn't win?
Kurisu: But nobody aside from Okabe remembers him sending it.
Rintaro: But I showed you guys afterwards. It was still in my phone's arrival history.
Itaru: We were so close.
Mayuri: Is that all?
Rintaro: No. There's more. Moeka and Lukako each sent a D-Mail.
Kurisu: Oh, right. That's what you claim, but Hashida, Mayuri-san, and I don't remember either of those.
Mayuri: Owww... Mayushii's getting a headache...
Rintaro: I already told you guys. I'm the only one who keeps his memories after the world changes.
Kurisu: So according to your perspective, when did the IBN 5100 disappear? Did it just happen? When's the last time you remember seeing it in the lab?
Rintaro: Well...
UNSPOKEN: I put my index finger to my forehead and search my memories. IBN 5100... IBN 5100...
Rintaro: I'm sure... it was August 3rd. I remember it being in the lab on August 3rd.
Kurisu: Are you certain?
