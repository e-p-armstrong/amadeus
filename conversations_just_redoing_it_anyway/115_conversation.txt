Rintaro: Ah. So Christina really does have a birthmark on her bu--
Kurisu: NO!
UNSPOKEN: After working on the PhoneWave (name subject to change) for about an hour, I head to a convenience store to buy dinner. Daru hasn't shown his face at all today. He must be busy with that part-time job. I still don't know what he's doing, exactly. Probably something that utilizes his super hacka skills. I just hope he steers clear of the law. While walking, I skim @channel on my phone. Titor hasn't shown up lately. I think it's been a week since his last appearance. I've been reluctant to contact him ever since he called me the Messiah in his last email. That was about the same time he stopped posting. Now @channel's denizens are busy slandering Titor. The majority opinion is that he ran away. I wonder where Titor went. I tried emailing him the other day, but he hasn't replied. His disappearance is especially worrying now that I think he might be Suzuha's dad. I need to contact him somehow. Just then, a mail arrives. No sender name. The address is... one I've seen once before. ...I've got a bad feeling about this. I pause and take a look around. Then I swallow my fear and open the mail. It feels as if a cold hand stroked my spine. I hug myself, shuddering at the sight. I delete the email immediately. It's happening again. This is bad. Really bad. This is a threat. Was it sent by the Organization? By SERN? Does SERN know what we've been doing? Should I report it to the police? Wait, I can't. I just deleted it. And in any case, a picture alone probably isn't enough to get the police involved. Still, maybe I should talk to someone. But who? Not the girls. I can't worry them with this. I'm the adult here, after all. What about Moeka? No. She may be a lab mem, but she's been acting weird lately. Even if I tell her about this, she won't be any use. Suzuha... has her father to worry about. I guess that leaves Daru. I need to find out whether SERN has discovered our hacking. What would SERN do if they did find out, I wonder? They wouldn't have us killed, would they? Despite my efforts to convince myself that this is just a prank, my feet hurry me back to the lab. I burst into the lab gasping for air and quickly lock the door behind me. Finally, I can catch my breath. But just then, I realize that something's wrong. Mayuri and Kurisu aren't here. Did they go home? No, their bags are still here. The lights are still on. The door. When I entered just now, it was unlocked. Would they be so careless? The memory of that threatening email fills me with fear. Don't tell me. Were they kidnapped!? Who took them? The Organization? SERN!? And then I hear a noise. Is that the shower? The lab has a shower inside the dressing room. There's no bath -- we can't afford such luxuries -- and it's too small to fit more than one person inside. Now I hear the sound of water running. I recall the famous scene from Hitchcock's Psycho. No! Fresh blood, mixing into the water and flowing down the drain. The corpses of two girls, sprawled out naked on the tile. The second those images flash through my head, I slam open the door to the shower room.
Rintaro: Is everyone okay!?
Kurisu: Kyaaa! What are you doing!?
