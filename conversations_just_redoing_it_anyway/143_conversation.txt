Rintaro: Then what do we do!?
Kurisu: Calm down.
Rintaro: How can I calm down!? Do you know how many times I've seen Mayuri die!? Covered in blood! Gasping for breath! The light fading from her eyes! Again... and again... and again... And all I could do... was watch!
UNSPOKEN: I hear my teeth grinding in my skull. Recalling that despair, that feeling of utter powerlessness, makes me want to lash out at everything within reach.
Kurisu: Getting emotional won't solve anything.
Rintaro: You're only calm because you weren't there!
Kurisu: ...True. I don't know what happens five hours from now. To be honest, it doesn't feel real at all. But it's not like I don't believe you. You have to stay strong, Okabe.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu pats my arm. Her hand is warm and her touch is gentle. How... American of her.
Rintaro: ...Sorry.
UNSPOKEN: She's right. Getting emotional won't solve anything. I need to calm down. Calm down...
Rintaro: What I don't understand is how the cause can change but the effect can stay the same. It's like causality itself is broken.
Kurisu: Maybe Kiryu Moeka shooting her isn't the real cause of her death. Maybe it's something larger and less obvious. For example, maybe she dies because we invented a time machine, or because SERN discovered our hacking. If that's the cause, then it doesn't really matter how she dies. Causality remains intact.
Rintaro: Can that theory explain why Nae pushed her in front of a train?
Kurisu: Oh, right... hmm... Anyway, the principle of causality is absolute. Deny that, and you deny all of physics. There must be a distinct cause for Mayuri's death.
Rintaro: So if we figure out what it is, then maybe we can save her.
Kurisu: Not necessarily.
Rintaro: What do you mean?
Kurisu: The problem is when the causal event occurred. If it happened too far in the past... then there's nothing we can do.
Rintaro: But I can travel to any time I had a cell phone, can't I!?
Kurisu: No. It's still theoretical, but I believe that one leap with our machine has a maximum range of 48 hours.
UNSPOKEN: 48 hours... I can only go back two days!?
Rintaro: Why didn't you tell me that before!?
Kurisu: Before what? I just finished the Time Leap Machine, remember?
UNSPOKEN: That's true...
Rintaro: Future you didn't say anything about it either.
Kurisu: Oh, so that's what you mean. Maybe she just didn't have the chance.
Rintaro: So how come I can only leap 48 hours?
Kurisu: I don't know. Even I don't understand everything that's going on inside that thing. But you can do consecutive leaps. That is, as long as the Time Leap Machine exists. For example, if the Time Leap Machine remains functional for ten straight years, you could leap back to this moment ten years from now. Of course, it would take a total of 1825 leaps, so I don't recommend it. Still, it's theoretically possible.
Rintaro: Then what's the problem?
Kurisu: Weren't you listening? I said, as long as the Time Leap Machine exists. When was the machine completed?
Rintaro: ...Ah.
Kurisu: Exactly. An hour ago. August 13th, 2010. 2:00 PM, or thereabouts. It didn't exist before then. It's impossible to use the machine before 2 PM today.
Rintaro: So what you're saying is...
UNSPOKEN: Count 48 hours back.
Rintaro: I can't go back farther than 2 PM on the 11th!?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu nods, her expression grave.
Kurisu: Most likely.
Rintaro: Can't you improve it!?
Kurisu: Eventually, maybe, but certainly not now. I'd need a real laboratory with real equipment. It would be expensive, which means we'd need sponsors. And if we go looking, I'm pretty sure SERN would crush us. I'd say that's proven by the fact that neither you nor I have leapt here from the far future yet.
