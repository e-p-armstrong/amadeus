Rintaro: We can't do anything!? Even with the Time Leap Machine, we can't stop SERN from killing Mayuri five hours from now!?
UNSPOKEN: At that moment, I hear a sound from outside the window. What? Is it Moeka!? Did she overhear us!? I dash to the window and look down at the street. It's Suzuha. Her bicycle has fallen over, and she's scurrying to pick it up. Our eyes meet.
Rintaro: ...Huh?
UNSPOKEN: Why does she look so pale? Her lips move slightly. It looks like she's whispering something, but I can't make it out from here.
Rintaro: Hey!
UNSPOKEN: I call out to Suzuha, but she leaps on her bike and zips away. She's acting strange. I smell a conspiracy. Moeka was a spy. Could Suzuha be the same? It's too dangerous to trust anyone. Suzuha has exhibited suspicious behavior, though not as much as Moeka has. She's openly hostile towards Kurisu, and she was able to take down SERN's hit squad singlehandedly. I wonder if this missing father of hers really exists. Could he be the John Titor who's been posting on the internet? What is the meaning of the name Barrel Titor? Instinct tells me that she knows something. I dash out of the lab.
Kurisu: Hey! Where are you going!?
