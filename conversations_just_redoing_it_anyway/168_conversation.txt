Rintaro: Mister Braun gave it to me. It's a device that can measure the divergence of worldlines.
Mayuri: Wow, that sounds amazing... what's a worldline?
UNSPOKEN: I smile wryly.
Rintaro: Mayuri, you really are a dummy.
UNSPOKEN: What am I doing? After I left Tennouji's house, I called Mayuri to ask when she would arrive in Akiba. Then, I went to the station to pick her up. Anxiety still smolders in my heart. We managed to survive yesterday, but that doesn't guarantee our safety forever. It's entirely possible for Moeka to attack now, on the afternoon of the 14th. Maybe I'm being overprotective, but I still can't shake the image of Mayuri's death from my mind. I don't ever want to have to go through that again.
Rintaro: Just a thought, Mayuri, but don't you think maybe you should stop coming to Akiba for a while? At least until ComiMa ends.
UNSPOKEN: No response. I look to the side.
Rintaro: Mayuri!?
UNSPOKEN: Panicked, I scan the area and catch sight of her wandering towards a newly-opened shaved ice stand. That ditz... Can't she tell how worried I am?
Kurisu: So you're the devoted type, huh?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu is glaring at me with an ice coffee in her hand. We're in the lab, which appears to have become her second home.
Rintaro: What's that supposed to mean?
UNSPOKEN: I'm sitting at the computer, searching for intel on the IBN 5100. I still don't know where it is. I went to Yanabayashi Shrine this morning, but alas, it wasn't there. Suzuha promised to get one to us somehow. Her gift to us from 1975. Without it, we can't hack into SERN's database, meaning we can't achieve divergence over 1%.
Kurisu: All of a sudden, you're treating Mayuri like a princess. Today you went to the station to meet her, you taste tested her lunch, and then you held her hand all the way back to the lab.
Mayuri: Okarin really loves Mayushii! Ehehe!
UNSPOKEN: Did she have to tell Kurisu, of all people? Mayuri looks so carefree as she stuffs her cheeks with takoyaki. I'm pretty sure she's smiling not because of my love, but because of the takoyaki's deliciousness. Typical Mayuri. But seriously, did you have to tell Kurisu?
Kurisu: So what's the deal?
Rintaro: I don't follow.
Kurisu: Are you a couple or what? I've been meaning to ask.
Rintaro: Do we look like a couple?
Kurisu: Huh!? Uh... well... umm...
UNSPOKEN: Just what sort of delusions does this girl have?
Mayuri: You know, Okarin and Mayushii have been friends since we were littleâ™ª Mwawoohii's weeally hwawy nawo.
Rintaro: Don't talk with your mouth full.
Kurisu: So... you're not a couple. Oh. Well, of course! No one would willingly date Okabe, after all.
Rintaro: Pff. You disappoint me, Christina!
Kurisu: Hah? What are you talking about?
Rintaro: You have finally revealed your true nature. I saw how your eyes lit up at the first hint of romance! You're nothing but a filthy mainstream girl! I bet you like to eat chocolate with your girlfriends and giggle about the latest celebrity love affair! Absurd! This lab has no need of the puppies and flowers in your head!
UNSPOKEN: It feels strange to be spewing this chuunibyou nonsense again, after what I've been through. Gh, is my innocence lost forever?
Kurisu: What the hell are you on about, you self-proclaimed mad scientist chuunibyou nutcase?
