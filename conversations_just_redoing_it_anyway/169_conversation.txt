UNSPOKEN: Then... does that mean I haven't saved her? Divergence is still less than 1%. Is the world still converging on Mayuri's death? It can't be. It can't be. I mean, nothing happened yesterday. Mayuri's here, safe and sound. So nothing will happen to her. It won't. I want to believe that, but the doubt within my heart is growing, thick and black. I can hardly think about anything else now. No matter how hard I stare at it, the number on the meter doesn't change a digit. So far, Reading Steiner has only activated after we sent past-changing D-Mails. What about when I time leap? The vertigo I feel when I time leap might be caused by Reading Steiner. Or maybe it's just a side effect of the memory transfer. It's impossible to know. In any case, I've prepared for the worst. I've already set the Time Leap Machine's timer to send my memories three hours into the past. And with Daru's help, I found a remote for the 42-inch CRT downstairs. Our previous PhoneWave (name subject to change) experiments made a hole in the floor. Instead of fixing the hole, I made it bigger. The 42-inch CRT is right under the hole, so if I point the remote at the hole and press the power button, the TV turns on. Now, should things go wrong, I can time leap at a moment's notice. And I also have Future Gadget No. 4: Moad Snake on hand, in case of emergency.
Kurisu: Okabe.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu enters the development room.
Kurisu: Didn't you say we weren't going to experiment with the Time Leap Machine?
Rintaro: This is just in case.
Kurisu: In case what?
