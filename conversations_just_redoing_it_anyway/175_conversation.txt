UNSPOKEN: Something's wrong.
Rintaro: Hey, what happened!? Daru!?
Itaru: I'm sor... some guys... came out of nowhere... they took Mayu-shi... I think... they wanted... me... I... ran... but Mayu-shi... What do I do, Okarin!?
UNSPOKEN: It's the Rounders. They kidnapped her. And then they probably killed her. To them, Mayuri is expendable. I grind my teeth in frustration. It didn't work. I still haven't averted Mayuri's death. I toss Moad Snake onto the couch. The preparations were a waste. Mayuri died somewhere else. I hang up and walk to the development room.
Rintaro: I won't let you kill Mayuri!
UNSPOKEN: And so, once more, I send my memories to the past. An unpleasant sound pierces my ears. My vision ripples. My flesh and my soul momentarily feel separate. I grab my right wrist. I close my eyes, take deep breaths, and wait for my pulse to return to normal.
Rintaro: Whew...
UNSPOKEN: The worst is over. All that's left is a headache. Now I have my answer. Mayuri's death is still fixed, just as in my heart I knew it would be. The change merely delayed it by another 24 hours. I need to cancel Lukako's D-Mail. I sit down in a pipe chair and try to come up with a plan. Nothing. I've been searching for a way to tell Lukako the truth, but every mental simulation I run ends with her in tears. I suppose that's to be expected. After all, I've already seen it happen once. I mistook Lukako for a guy, and she ended up in tears. I mean, Lukako cries at just about anything... To broach the topic now would be like poking an open wound. Damn. It looks like I have no choice but to ask Kurisu. She's a girl, so she should understand how Lukako feels. I call Kurisu out to the bench in front of the Braun Tube Workshop. We're alone.
Kurisu: This seems serious.
Rintaro: Yes. I have a difficult problem that requires... delicacy to resolve.
Kurisu: Delicacy? That's like the exact opposite of what anyone expects from you.
Rintaro: That's why I want to ask a girl. Plus, you're my assistant, so I need you to save my ass this instant.
Kurisu: Oh, you. Why do you need to ask a girl anyway?
UNSPOKEN: I give her the rundown -- including how many times I've time leaped, and what happened with Suzuha and Faris. How many times have I explained this to her now? This time, she believes me more readily than I expected. The only thing she doesn't believe is the story about Lukako.
Kurisu: Urushibara-san is actually a guy? That's totally ridiculous.
Rintaro: But it's the truth. Was the truth.
Kurisu: So basically, umm...
UNSPOKEN: She wrinkles her brow in thought.
Kurisu: She looked like Hashida?
UNSPOKEN: Crap, I got a mental image there for a second. Judging by her expression, so did Kurisu.
Rintaro & Kurisu: Ugh.
UNSPOKEN: We grimace.
Kurisu: Unacceptable! There's no way such a cute girl was a guy.
Rintaro: Hey, hold your horses. I never said that Lukako looked like a guy. He actually looked pretty much the same. He was always androgynous, so much you couldn't help but think he was secreting excess female hormones or something.
UNSPOKEN: As a result, I didn't even notice when Lukako became a girl at first, and made a fatal mistake.
Kurisu: He looked like she does now?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's gaze wanders for bit...
Kurisu: Acceptable.
UNSPOKEN: What?
Kurisu: Anyway. You want to turn her back into a guy?
Rintaro: Unless we do, Mayuri dies.
Kurisu: Mayuri's life is tied to Urushibara-san's gender... That's so crazy it doesn't seem real at all. Have you come up with a solution?
