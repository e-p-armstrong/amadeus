Rintaro: Uh, yeah. So put the Juicy Chicken Number One in the microwave and nuke it so that the D-Mail's basically ABC and...
Mayuri: Huwha?
Rintaro: The microwave was developed by knights of the Rosicrucian Order who used alchemy. Meaning that the sound of the chime is the brainwashing device, while the chime itself actually doesn't have any meaning at all...
Mayuri: Waaah, Okarin's broken!
UNSPOKEN: I mutter incoherently as I set up the Time Leap Machine.
Mayuri: What are you doing?
Rintaro: M-making a tactical retreat.
Mayuri: Retreat...?
UNSPOKEN: How far do I go? As far as I can. Yeah, that's it. Far. Far away from here. I jump all the way back to August 11th, the limit of the Time Leap Machine's range. When I'm done, Kurisu is standing before me, fiddling with the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s wiring.
Kurisu: Stop staring. You're distracting me. How many times do I have to tell you?
UNSPOKEN: She's still working on the Time Leap Machine upgrade. I know I shouldn't interrupt her, but there's nobody else I can rely on.
Rintaro: Genius neuroscientist, I need to talk to you.
Kurisu: Make it short.
Rintaro: I want you to come with me to Yanabayashi Shrine.
Kurisu: Tell me why. If it's a date or something, then I refuse.
Rintaro: H-Hououin Kyouma does not go on dates. Much less with his assistant. Ridiculous.
UNSPOKEN: She's glaring like she's gonna kill me. Let's leave the jokes aside for now...
Rintaro: S-so... I need you to explain the differences between the male brain and the female brain.
Kurisu: What.
UNSPOKEN: I briefly explain my situation and what happened with Lukako before I leaped. How many times have I explained this to Kurisu now?
Luka: Okabe-san... and Makise-san. Did you come to pray?
UNSPOKEN: Not exactly...
Kurisu: A-ahem. Actually, we have something to talk to you about, Urushibara-san.
UNSPOKEN: This is the strategy I thought up. Its name is Operation Christina. Lukako reacts differently to me. I already know she'll have a breakdown if I tell her she's a guy. But she's not too familiar with Kurisu, and they're both girls, so it should be easier if Kurisu tells her. That's why I forced -- I mean, persuaded Kurisu to handle it. So I wait behind Kurisu and watch silently.
Luka: What might that be?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako is shy. He was distant with me back when we first met. And I can see she's made a small wall between herself and Kurisu now too. On the other hand, Kurisu's very calm. Truly reliable. Kurisu puts on a gentle smile and begins her explanation.
Kurisu: Did you know? Male and female brains are very different.
Luka: What...?
UNSPOKEN: Hey...
Kurisu: Male brains are right-dominant. Female brains are left-dominant.
Luka: Y-yeah...?
Kurisu: By the way, the right brain handles image processing, spacial processing, and comprehensive judgment. The left brain handles things like language, and calculation. The right and left brains are connected by the corpus callosum, which is more developed in females. You know how people say that girls are better at multitasking? That can be explained by the development of the corpus callosum.
Luka: Uh... what...?
UNSPOKEN: What the hell is she talking about?
Kurisu: Actually, these theories are kinda fringe. They're not really that credible. So if you don't mind, I'd like to do an experiment.
Luka: A-an experiment?
Kurisu: I want to try mapping your brain patterns to see if they're more female or male.
Luka: What is mapping...?
UNSPOKEN: Lukako's clearly frightened.
Kurisu: Brainwave mapping. We just take a sample of your brainwaves. Anyway, you'll understand if you try it. Okay? Okay? It won't hurt a bit.
