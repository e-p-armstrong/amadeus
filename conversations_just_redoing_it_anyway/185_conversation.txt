Rintaro: Yeah, you're right.
UNSPOKEN: I'm sincerely relieved. Because Lukako smiled for me.
Luka: ...Please, save Mayuri-chan. Mayuri-chan is... really important to me.
Rintaro: Lukako...
Luka: Ahaha... um, please, go already. If you don't... I might cry... So, please... Thank you... for everything. Ah, this is when I use that phrase, right? Umm, El Psy Kongalee...
Rintaro: It's Kongroo.
UNSPOKEN: I find myself smiling. Lukako forces a smile too.
Luka: El Psy Kongroo.
UNSPOKEN: She bows deeply. She doesn't raise her head. A sign for me to go already. I turn back to the archway at the shrine's entrance. My feet are heavy. They won't advance. I stop in front of the stairs. Then I take out my phone.
Kurisu: Okabe? Mayuri called. She was mad. You stood her up on your promise to go to ComiMa.
Rintaro: Christina. I need you to enter a number into the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Kurisu: What? Explain yourself.
