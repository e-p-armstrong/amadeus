UNSPOKEN: FB's phone is in my possession. There's no longer any reason to stay on this worldline. It's only a matter of time until the police come looking for us. I should send the D-Mail immediately. When I do, the present will be reconstructed. Tennouji will still be alive. Moeka will still be in contact with FB. And at last, the IBN 5100 will return to me. I just need to think about saving Mayuri, and all will be well.
Rintaro: Do you think Daru's still in the lab?
Kurisu: I'll try calling.
UNSPOKEN: I'll send the same message I tried to send earlier from Moeka's phone. Only this time, it will be from FB's phone. When Moeka sees it, she'll believe it to be an order from FB. Knowing her dependence on FB, she'll obey without question. It makes me sick to be taking advantage of Moeka's vulnerabilities like this. How am I any different from FB?
Kurisu: He said he'll be there in five minutes.
UNSPOKEN: So we just wait until then.
Kurisu: By the way, something weird happened back there.
UNSPOKEN: After closing her phone, Kurisu glances at Moeka and lowers her voice.
Kurisu: While I was waiting outside, I heard a gunshot. And right after that... I saw her.
Rintaro: Her... who?
UNSPOKEN: I ask, even though I already know the answer. There's only one person it could be.
Kurisu: Nae-chan. She ran out the back door. When I called her to stop... our eyes met.
