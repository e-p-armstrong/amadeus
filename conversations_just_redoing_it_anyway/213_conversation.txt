Rintaro: ...Black Tortoise, Vermilion Bird, Blue Dragon, and White Tiger.
Mayuri: Yeah, that! You know, it was really fun talking to Okarin about stuff like that... But now... Um, Okarin? If Mayushii's a burden... just say so, okay?
Rintaro: What!? I never...!
Mayuri: Ehehe. I'm hanging up now. If you feel like talking to Mayushii about anything, just call okay? Tutturuâ™ª
UNSPOKEN: She hung up on me.
Kurisu: What did Mayuri say?
UNSPOKEN: The ringtone cuts off during my hesitation.
Kurisu: You're such a wimp. I'm disappointed in you.
Rintaro: Aren't you afraid of dying?
Kurisu: Did you not hear what I just said?
Rintaro: I heard, but--
UNSPOKEN: An email interrupts me. I don't want to argue with Kurisu any more, so I open my phone to break the conversation.
Rintaro: How are you a burden!? Don't say things like that, dammit! Why is she only serious at times like this!?
Kurisu: A burden, huh...
Rintaro: I've never felt Mayuri was a burden. Not once.
Kurisu: Then you should tell her that.
UNSPOKEN: Maybe it wasn't a good idea to leave Mayuri in the dark. She never looks like she's thinking anything. And yet, she saw my doubt? Either way, I can't tell her the truth.
Kurisu: Okabe.
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu sighs, then glares at me.
Kurisu: The old you wouldn't have worried about anything. Anyway, you should go see Mayuri. I'm sure she has a lot to say.
