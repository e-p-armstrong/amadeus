Kurisu: ...Kuh!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu suddenly pushes me away. She steps back. Her face is hidden behind her hair. But her fists are trembling. Her body exudes raw fury.
Kurisu: This is ridiculous! You... motherfucker!
Rintaro: Whoa!
Kurisu: I said I was fine! What do you mean you won't give up!? Are you stupid? Wanna die? Are you trying to be a hero, you chuunibyou wackjob? Don't make promises you can't keep! Your stupidity is infuriating! Why can't you just do as I say!?
Rintaro: I...
Kurisu: What's the problem, huh!? If you weigh the options logically, saving Mayuri is the only--
Rintaro: Fuck logic!
Kurisu: ...!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu stares at me in shock.
Rintaro: I'm not God! Maybe I got close, but that's not me! I can't decide who lives and who dies anymore!
UNSPOKEN: Suzuha. Faris. Lukako. I sacrificed their happiness to save Mayuri. And the whole time, a voice in the back of my head was asking... Is this really okay? What gives me the right?
Rintaro: This time...
UNSPOKEN: This time, I want to save both of them, without sacrificing anyone.
Kurisu: Hmph!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu turns away with a frown, then starts tapping her foot in a clear gesture of displeasure.
Kurisu: There's nothing you can do. It's the choice of Steins Gate. Isn't that what you always say? The equation is proven, Okabe. There's no escape. You're just one man. No matter how hard you try, you can't overcome the will of the universe.
Rintaro: I know... but I'm still going to try!
UNSPOKEN: I won't lose Mayuri or Kurisu.
Kurisu: Kuh...
UNSPOKEN: I hear Kurisu grinding her teeth. Then she turns her back to me.
Kurisu: Have it your way! But I'm not helping. I'm going back to America, and that's that. Goodbye. I don't expect we'll meet again, Hououin Kyouma.
Rintaro: Kuh...
Kurisu: I can't believe this! How stupid can you be? You're so... stupid!
