UNSPOKEN: Kurisu's cheeks start to redden, and she turns away.
Kurisu: Will you... remember me?
UNSPOKEN: Her voice is barely a whisper.
Rintaro: Of course I'll remember you. Of course I will! There's no way I could ever forget the girl most important to me!
Kurisu: Eh? Y-you mean... Wh-what the hell are you saying!?
Rintaro: The truth.
Kurisu: B-but... proof. I need proof. I can't come up with a formula otherwise!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu is getting flustered for some reason.
Kurisu: When the anterior pituitary gland hypersecretes ACTH, and gamma waves induce stochastic resonance, we can assume an infinite Hausdorff dimension for the Hilbert curve. That is, we can measure the asymptotic line with positron emission tomography...?
Rintaro: Kurisu.
UNSPOKEN: I speak her name. Our eyes meet.
Rintaro: I love you.
Kurisu: ...!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu looks away. Her face is bright red.
Rintaro: And you?
Kurisu: Eh!? Wh-what!?
Rintaro: Do you, uh... How do you feel about me?
Kurisu: Y-you want to know?
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu suddenly looks me straight in the eye. Her face is still red, but her expression is firm. She walks straight up to me, grabs me by the collar, and jerks me towards her.
Kurisu: Close your eyes!
UNSPOKEN: Did I make her mad? Perhaps Kurisu hates me for some reason. Maybe she really did mean all those insults she's said to me. That would be really sad... I slowly lick my trembling lips, and timidly try to ask a question.
Rintaro: Why close my--
Kurisu: Just shut up and close them!
UNSPOKEN: I do as I'm told, though I still don't know why she's so angry. My collar is still in Kurisu's grip.
Kurisu: nn...
UNSPOKEN: Abruptly, I feel a soft sensation against my lips. The faint scent of citrus tickles my nose. When I open my eyes in surprise... I see Kurisu's face scant millimeters away. And then I understand what has happened. She's kissing me. Her lips are very warm. My mind goes blank. I'm unable to think. I want to stay like this forever. But soon, our lips separate. Kurisu looks down shyly.
Rintaro: Wha... wha...
Kurisu: I-it's not like I did it... because I wanted to or anything. It's just... you promised... that you wouldn't forget about me. Research shows that memories are harder to forget when coupled with intense emotions. Y-you're a virgin and a perv, so I was sure you'd have an elaborative rehearsal on your first kiss, instantly making it a long-term memory you'd never forget... so... I just don't want you to forget about me, Okabe. No matter what.
UNSPOKEN: My heart fills with love for Kurisu as she makes her frantic excuses. What a relief. Kurisu wasn't mad. She was just trying to hide her embarrassment. I want to be with her even more. I want to talk with her even more. I want to learn even more about her. But I know that wish can never come true. My chest tightens. I feel like I'm suffocating. Desperate to keep my emotions under control, I place my own hands on top of Kurisu's, which are still grabbing my collar.
Rintaro: S-sorry to disappoint you.
Kurisu: ...eh?
Rintaro: That wasn't my first kiss.
Kurisu: W-why you... You're just a cherry boy!
Rintaro: Shut up, virgin.
UNSPOKEN: I remember playfully kissing Mayuri in elementary school. And just a little while ago, I forcibly kissed Moeka to silence her. But that was on another worldline, and now it never happened, so... I guess it doesn't count?
Kurisu: So it wasn't your first...
