Rintaro: ...Kuh!
UNSPOKEN: I instinctively dodge back. The knife misses me by a hair. He gathers himself for another strike. The sight of his face twisted in madness and rage fills me with terror. I want to scream. He's going to kill me! No, don't be afraid! I can't die here. The past is already decided! But wait. If the past is already decided, then doesn't that mean I can't save Kurisu?  I shake off the thought. Just think about saving her!
Nakabachi: Apologize!
Rintaro: Gh--
UNSPOKEN: Swallowing my fear, I force myself to stop running away. Instead, I lunge forward. I knock Nakabachi's hand aside. The knife falls from his grip and clatters to the floor. I leap on it and pick it up. That was easier than I expected.
Kurisu: Stop it, Papa!
Nakabachi: Don't tell me what to do!
UNSPOKEN: I look up in surprise. Nakabachi has taken a screwdriver from a toolbox left in the passage. Kurisu is walking towards him, pleading with him to stop. She's completely defenseless. No, Kurisu! Stay away from him! You're the one in danger, not me! Just when I thought I'd disarmed him, he finds something else! Even a screwdriver can kill with enough force behind it.
Rintaro: Run, Kurisu!
UNSPOKEN: Kurisu glances at me, but she doesn't move. Why won't she run away!?
Kurisu: This is crazy, Papa! Please stop!
Nakabachi: What do you know? What do you know!?
UNSPOKEN: Nakabachi has completely lost his mind. Nothing she can say will reach him.
Nakabachi: If only you'd never been born!
UNSPOKEN: Nakabachi turns to Kurisu, brandishing his screwdriver. But Kurisu still doesn't run away.
Kurisu: Guh...!
UNSPOKEN: Blood spurts from the arm Kurisu used to guard her face. She's going to die. I have to do something! I grip the knife firmly in my hands. Kurisu won't die if I kill Nakabachi first. That image again! Stop getting in my way! I won't be tied to that past! I need to do this. To change the future. To save Kurisu!
Rintaro: NAKABACHI!
UNSPOKEN: As Nakabachi raises his arm for another blow, I thrust my knife at his unprotected back.
Kurisu: NO!
UNSPOKEN: Through the knife, my hand feels resistance. The sensation of tearing through flesh, scraping bone. It's surprisingly tough. But at the same time, I feel the flesh pulsating. It shifts in time with my victim's breath. I-- Stabbed--
Kurisu: Ah... guh...!
UNSPOKEN: I stabbed--
Rintaro: wh...y...
UNSPOKEN: I can't believe my eyes. What happened? I tried to stab Nakabachi. The blade should have pierced his back. And yet-- At the last minute, Kurisu forced herself between us, as if... as if to protect Nakabachi.
Rintaro: Why...
UNSPOKEN: Strength drains from Kurisu's body. She slumps against me, her head on my shoulder.
Nakabachi: Ha... hahahaha! A fitting end for you fools, hahahaha!
UNSPOKEN: Laughing maniacally, Nakabachi picks up the dropped thesis and runs to the elevator at the far end of the hall. I can't chase him. I know what's going to happen if I don't stop him, but I can't take a single step. Is this the joke? Is this the punchline? I wanted to know who killed Kurisu. And now...
Kurisu: I'm... sorry...
