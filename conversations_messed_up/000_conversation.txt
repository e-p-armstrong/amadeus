Rintaro: Y-you’re with the Organization!?
Kurisu: Huh?
Rintaro: If their tendrils have gotten this far, then I’ve made a grave mistake.
Kurisu: Stop fooling around and come with me. Try anything and people are sure to notice. What will your superiors say then?

Rintaro: My knowledge has no limits. Genius girl, our next meeting shall be as enemies!
Kurisu: Huh?
