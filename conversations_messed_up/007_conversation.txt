Kurisu: Doctor Nakabachi...
Rintaro: But wait, Daru. Didn’t you say that Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation was cancelled?
Itaru: Yeah, but you went with Mayu-shi anyway, remember?
Rintaro: That reminds me. I sent you an email back then. Did you get it?
Itaru: An email?
Kurisu: That email you showed me at ATF yesterday? It said someone stabbed me at the presentation, didn’t it?
