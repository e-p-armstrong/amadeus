Rintaro: E-everyone okay?
Itaru: S-somehow.
Kurisu: That was definitely more than two seconds.
Mayuri: O-Okarin? Umm, what just happened?
Rintaro: Are you okay? No burns or anything?
Mayuri: Hmm... It doesn’t hurt anywhere, so I think I’m okay...
Kurisu: H-hey! Look at this!
Itaru: What the hell? How did that... Yeah, it’s a microwave, but it’s not heavy enough to make a hole in the floor...
Kurisu: This can’t be caused by electrical discharge. Some other phenomenon?
Rintaro: Heh... heh heh heh... MUHAHAHA! Just as my calculations predicted!
Itaru: ...So, about Mayu-shi’s chicken.
Mayuri: Eh? Ahh! M-Mayushii’s chicken is all burnt black...
Rintaro: Juicy Chicken Number One made a noble sacrifice for the progress of science. Let us pray for his happiness in the next life.
Kurisu: The chicken doesn’t matter! Right now, we need to determine what happened with the Phonewa--
Mayuri: It doesn’t matter? That’s so mean, uh, Christina-chan...
Kurisu: Hey, Hououin Kyouma! Do something about this! Mayushii-san learned my name wrong!
Itaru: More importantly, we need ventilation. *cough cough*
Rintaro: Silence, all of you! Muhaha! Muhahaha! MUHAHAHAHA! It all connects. There’s a meaning behind this series of events, and only one true answer. I’ve discovered the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s true hidden function! This isn’t intuition. That’s right. This is conviction!
Kurisu: Just spit it out. What do you think it is?
Rintaro: First, let me say one thing. The greatest inventions are created by accident. This we call serendipity.
Kurisu: Get on with it.
Rintaro: The mail was sent to the past. The chicken returned to its frozen state. The plucked banana returned to the bunch.
Kurisu: ...No way.
Rintaro: Yes way! The PhoneWave (name subject to change)... Is a time machine!
Kurisu: A time machine? A time machine!? It can’t be!!
