Rintaro: I got an IBN 5100.
Kurisu: Oh, that thing you were talking about yesterday.
Suzuha: Ah...!
Kurisu: Y-yes?
Suzuha: Makise Kurisu?
Kurisu: Yes...?
Kurisu: What is it? Have I done something to you?
Suzuha: ...Hmph.
Kurisu: Who was that?
Mayuri: Oh, she works part-time at the Braun Tube Workshop. Her name’s Suzu-san!
Rintaro: I know.

Kurisu: Why was she glaring at me like that?
Rintaro: How should I know? Did you do something to make her angry?
Kurisu: I’ve never seen her before in my life. How rude.

Rintaro: I said all members assemble, didn’t I!?
Kurisu: Haah, haah... why do I... have to...
