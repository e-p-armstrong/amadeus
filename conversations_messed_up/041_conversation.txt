Kurisu: Then lets resume the experiments.
Mayuri: But won’t the manager scold us again?
Rintaro: Heh, don’t worry. Yesterday, I made this promise with Mister Braun. ’I swear there won’t be any more shaking today.’ In other words, the no-shaking promise only applied yesterday, so since today is yesterday’s tomorrow, we can shake it all we want!
Kurisu: That doesn’t settle anything. Why you’re so confident is a mystery to me.
Rintaro: In other words, Christina, you want me to erase Mister Braun.
Kurisu: No! Besides, I don’t think a wimp like you stands a chance against him.
