Kurisu: And here I thought you had ambition.
Rintaro: Don’t get me wrong. This isn’t about world peace and it isn’t about ambition. It’s about discovering whether or not we can change the past. The easiest way to do that is to see if we can win the lottery, right?
Kurisu: But your primary goal is the money, isn’t it?
Rintaro: With that kind of money, I could say goodbye to this rickety old building! Muhahaha! I could get an office in Daibiru or UPX!
Kurisu: See? Just like I thought.
Rintaro: I won’t whitewash it. If we moved, we could experiment as much as we want without fear of Mister Braun. If we had money, we could build the Future Gadgets of our dreams. And of course, we could buy a truckload of Mayuri’s favorite bananas.
Mayuri: A t-truckload?
Kurisu: No, Mayuri-san! Don’t let him tempt you!
Rintaro: Shut it, Celeb Seventeen!
Kurisu: S-se...? Serendipity?
Rintaro: Celeb. Seventeen.
Kurisu: What the hell is that supposed to mean!?
Rintaro: You live in a hotel off of your parents’ money. You could never understand the plight of poor students like us. What do you think, Moeka-san?
Kurisu: Um...?
Rintaro: If you’re going to complain, then suggest an alternative. A change to the past that would be both trivial and easy to understand. Got anything?
Kurisu: Um...
Mayuri: Hmm?
Kurisu: Let’s try changing the hotel I’m staying at.
Rintaro: How are we supposed to know the difference? If you want to stay in Uguisudani, do it on your own. That should be easy for a Celeb Seventeen like you.
Kurisu: Do you have to say it like that?
Itaru: Anyway, why Uguisudani?
Rintaro: Because that’s where all the love hotels ar--
Kurisu: One more word out of you and I excise your frontal lobe with a rusty scalpel.
