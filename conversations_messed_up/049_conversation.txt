Kurisu: That is an awful lot of money... hahaha...
Rintaro: No, not that. 1st place would be... too conspicuous.
Kurisu: What?
Rintaro: Don’t you get it!? I’m being chased by the Organization. If we win 1st prize, the media will cover the event and my cover will be blown!
Kurisu: That’s stupid.
Mayuri: What if Mayushii wins?
Rintaro: No. Stage Two of Operation Urd does have its risks, just like Celeb Sev said.
Kurisu: Celeb... Sev? Don’t abbreviate it.
Rintaro: I’ll be the winner. That way, I shoulder all of the risk.
Kurisu: And all of the money, right? I see your plan.
Rintaro: Anyway, we should aim a little lower. Daru, how much is 2nd prize?
Itaru: Umm, looks like it was... 23 million yen.
Rintaro: ...L-let’s try 3rd prize.
Itaru: That was only 700, 000 yen.
Rintaro: Yeah, that’s good. That should be about right.
Kurisu: You’re such a chicken.
Rintaro: Heh, heh heh heh! That’s rich, coming from the one who was so worried about the risk of time paradoxes. Eh, Celeb Sev!?
Kurisu: I’m begging you, stop calling me that. I’ll settle for assistant. And don’t misunderstand. I’m still worried about what could go wrong.
Rintaro: I’m trying to minimize our risk by choosing an amount that’s just right. Stop being so stubborn.
Kurisu: ...No, you.
