Rintaro: Listen up, lab mems! It’s time to resume Operation Urd!
Itaru: Seriously? The manager’s still downstairs, you know?
Rintaro: Fret not. It’s almost closing time for the Braun Tube Workshop.
Kurisu: The PhoneWave doesn’t work at night, remember?
Rintaro: It’s worth a try! We need to figure out how late the PhoneWave (name subject to change) works. At the same time, I want to see if the two of you can use D-Mails to change the past.
Itaru: Change the past...!
Rintaro: Change the past to your liking. As long as it’s something easy to observe.
Kurisu: I’m going back to my hotel. Show me your report on today’s experiment tomorrow.
Rintaro: Hold it!
Kurisu: Hey! What’s your problem!?
Rintaro: Who’s writing that report?
Kurisu: You, of course. This is your operation. And if we could get a report from the subject too, that would be even better.
Rintaro: ...Are you not interested in changing the past? What happened to your eagerness to experiment?
Kurisu: Did you forget what I said this afternoon? I’m against it.
Rintaro: But you were so enthusiastic when we began the experiments. You went along without a single complaint.
Kurisu: In your dreams, maybe.
Rintaro: You’re not being objective, Christi... Celeb Sev.
Kurisu: If you’re going to correct yourself, at least get it right.
