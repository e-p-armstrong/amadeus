Kurisu: Good morning.
Rintaro: What did you say to the part-timer downstairs?
Kurisu: Nothing much. I told her if she wanted to say something, she should just say it.
Rintaro: What did she say?
Kurisu: Nothing. She just groaned. I wonder what’s wrong with her.
Itaru: She’s jealous of Makise-shi’s popularity, duh! She’s thinking ’If only I’d joined the lab instead of her. Then I would be having fun with everyone right now! I’m so jealous!’ or something like that. I’m telling you, man. 3D is hell.
Kurisu: If she wants my lab mem number, she can have it.
Rintaro: What!? The lab mem number you carry is the highest credential a scientist could hope to achieve! They sell for millions on the black market, but you would give it away!?
Kurisu: It’s not exactly a counterfeit passport. Also, shut up.
