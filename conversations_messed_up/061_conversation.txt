Kurisu: What’s going on?
Rintaro: No, that’s not the problem.
Kurisu: Hmmm, I see. I understand how you feel, but since this is an experiment, data collection should take priority.
Rintaro: Oh? We agree for once, assistant.
Kurisu: I-I’m not agreeing with you, exactly. If we don’t collect data, then we’ll never figure out how the PhoneWave works.
Mayuri: But girls have lots of secrets, you know? You shouldn’t ask her to tell her secrets, Okarin. That’s perverted!
Itaru: Whoa! Is that where we’re going with this!?
Rintaro: Calm down, Daru! We’re not asking you to send something private.
Kurisu: Even if you want to send something private, you shouldn’t for now. We still don’t know how this thing handles paradoxes, so we need to be extremely careful.
Moeka: ...Nothing private?
Kurisu: Nothing you want to keep secret, at least. Even if you mean well, the mail’s content might have a serious effect on the timeline. You should show your mail to a third party and have them check if the content is problematic or not.
Rintaro: Indeed. My assistant said everything I wanted to say. I will add only that the experiment must go on!
Kurisu: ...I wasn’t speaking for you. Don’t misunderstand. Experiments prioritize data over privacy in the first place. If you’re going to be a test subject, you need to be prepared for that.
Mayuri: Really? Mayushii wasn’t prepared for that... I’m sorry, Chris-chan...
Kurisu: You don’t have to apologize. I’m not criticizing you. It’s just how these things work.
