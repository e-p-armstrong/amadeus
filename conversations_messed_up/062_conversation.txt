Kurisu: Cut the chatter and get started.
Itaru: What if the manager says something?
Rintaro: Muhahaha! Don’t be afraid of Mister Braun! If he storms in yelling, I’ll kick him to the curb!
Itaru: Seriously? Okarin, you’re so cool! That’s why we love you!
Kurisu: He’s just talk. PhoneWave (name subject to change), activate! Guh!! Where’s Shining Finger? Where’d she go?
Kurisu: Shining what?
Itaru: Okarin. Japanese please.
Rintaro: Where’s Kiryu Moeka? She was here just now, wasn’t she!?
Mayuri: Uhwhaaa? Whoooo?
Rintaro: Kiryu Moeka!
Itaru: Who’s that?
Kurisu: Never heard of her.
Rintaro: ...No way.
Kurisu: Did it happen again, Okabe?
Rintaro: What do you mean, ’again’?
Kurisu: Something like this happened yesterday. You remembered something we didn’t. Uh, what did you call it? Oh yeah, Reading Steiner.
Mayuri: Are you okay? You’re really pale.
Rintaro: Y-yeah... I’m fine. ...Assistant, how much do you remember about the experiment we just did?
Kurisu: I don’t remember doing any experiments today. You sent a D-Mail just now, didn’t you?
Rintaro: ...Yeah. But things are different from yesterday. I didn’t send the D-Mail. Kiryu Moeka did. Christina. Let’s say a D-Mail caused a time paradox. What would happen?
Kurisu: ...I don’t know. No one has experienced a time paradox, after all.
Rintaro: But before, didn’t you say something like the world would disappear?
Kurisu: All I said was that that was one theory. Maybe nothing happens, and like in a certain movie, history gets amended to accommodate the paradox. According to Dr. Hawking’s chronology protection conjecture, it’s impossible to do anything that might cause a time paradox in the first place.
