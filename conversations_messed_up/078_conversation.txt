Kurisu: Hallo.
Rintaro: It’s me. What’s the situation?
Rintaro: She hung up on me!
Itaru: Of course she did. Mayu-shi and I are the only ones who can deal with your act, you know?
Kurisu: Hallo.
Rintaro: It’s Hououin Kyouma. Don’t hang up.
Kurisu: Oh, it’s Okabe. I was sure it was a prank call.
Rintaro: It shows you my number, doesn’t it!?
Kurisu: You were talking crazy, so I got scared and hung up.
Rintaro: In other words, you fear the insanity of Hououin Kyouma! Well, I suppose you can’t be blamed for-- She hung up! Again!
Itaru: Like I said, we’re the only ones who can put up with you...
Kurisu: Hallo.
Rintaro: This is Okabe Rintaro. Sorry, but could you mess with the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s settings a little, please?
Kurisu: Well why didn’t you say so? Hmm... you’re going to use the PhoneWave? I don’t want to anger the guy downstairs, though.
Rintaro: We’re about to perform a critical experiment. Understand, assistant? Mister Braun might yell at you, but that small sacrifice will bring mankind’s dream, the time machine, to fruition.
Kurisu: You’re really irresponsible, you know that? ...Well? What should I set it to? Okay, it’s ready.
