Kurisu: Kyaaa! What are you doing!?
Mayuri: Hyah! No peeking, Okarin!
Rintaro: Phew. You’re still alive. Don’t scare me like that. What are you guys doing packed into that tiny shower anyway?
Kurisu: Get out, you perv!
Rintaro: Whoa!
Mayuri: Mayushii’s sad... I feel kinda dirty....
Kurisu: You’re gonna regret this! I’ll never forgive you!
Rintaro: It’s me. We have a problem. I’m under attack from the Mongolian Spot and Ditzy sisters. They’re going directly after my sanity, a bold move against the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma. This is the strongest offensive I’ve encountered so far. I realize now that vulnerability itself can be a powerful weapon. They’re pulling out all the stops, and I don’t think my pants can take it. Give in to the temptation? Nonsense. I could never do that. They’re fellow lab members, my loyal assistant and my childhood friend. ...Must I? Is it truly the will of Steins Gate that I give in? That I raise my hand against my closest companions? If so... then how cruel the fates be! El... Psy... Kongroo!
Kurisu: For the final adjustments, we need to use the PhoneWave.
Itaru: It’s up to you, Okarin.
Kurisu: Take care of it.
Rintaro: In other words, you’re sending me to die.
Kurisu: Your sacrifice will allow us to complete the time leap machine.
Itaru: Besides, you’re always the one who talks to the boss for us.
Rintaro: Well maybe it’s time for you to put your lives on the line.
Kurisu: I can’t. That girl who works there hates me.
