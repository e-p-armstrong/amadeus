Rintaro: No, he’s right. It is like an eroge. Each heroine’s route is an attractor field, and the small choices within are the individual worldlines. But at the end, they all enter the true route for the grand ending.
Itaru: The only difference is the length of the common parts. By the way, I’d choose the little sister’s attractor field.
Rintaro: Whatever.
Kurisu: You guys are hopeless. Better do something quick.
Suzuha: Umm, I don’t know what you guys are talking about...
Kurisu: Just ignore them.
Itaru: But then, isn’t it impossible to change the future? It always converges in the end, right? No matter what you do, the result is the same.
Suzuha: We have to escape Attractor Field Alpha.
Rintaro: Escape?
Suzuha: In other words, we’re going to jump to a worldline in Attractor Field Beta.
Kurisu: I thought attractor fields couldn’t interact.
Suzuha: Attractor fields are normally separate, but if we go to the instant they diverge...
Kurisu: The instant they diverge... is that now?
