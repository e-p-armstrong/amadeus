Kurisu: Wait a second. How do we know this is all true? What if Amane-san is just making stuff up?
Suzuha: What!? I’m not making stuff up!
Kurisu: Calm down. I’m not trying to pick a fight. But I still have questions. One, how do you know about Okabe’s power? Two, how did you know Okabe and I were in Akihabara in 2010? Don’t you know a little too much for someone born in 2017?
