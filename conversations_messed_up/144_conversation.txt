Kurisu: Wh-why aren’t you answering?
Rintaro: Not really.
Kurisu: Oh... okay.
Rintaro: Why do you ask?
Kurisu: Ah, no, just wondering! There’s no hidden meaning, okay!?
Rintaro: Why are you mad? Also, your face is red.
Kurisu: Is not! A-anyway! You should go out with Urushibara-san!
Rintaro: ...Seriously?
Kurisu: Y-you don’t like anyone else, right? Then answer her feelings, you dummy.
Rintaro: Mayuri dies in two days. I don’t have time to play boyfriend.
Kurisu: Just go out with her.
Rintaro: ...Seriously?
Kurisu: If there’s nobody you like, then there’s no reason not to, is there? Get close and help her work through her feelings. Then she’ll probably tell you what you need to know.
Rintaro: Mayuri dies in two days. I don’t have time for that touchy-feely stuff.
Kurisu: ...Only consider this as a last resort. If you’re willing to hurt Urushibara-san, you can always take the information by force.
Kurisu: She’ll forget after the worldline changes, won’t she? In that case, I think it’s a valid option. But only when compared to Mayuri’s death. ...I hate myself for suggesting this.
