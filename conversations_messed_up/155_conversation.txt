Kurisu: This is Makise.
Rintaro: Get ready for a D-Mail!
Kurisu: Okay, but what’s that noise!?
Rintaro: I’m having a little trouble here.
Kurisu: So you didn’t kill her. Good job! It’s ready.
Rintaro: And Mayuri?
Kurisu: Still here. She’s at the Braun Tube Workshop trying to get the manager to turn on the CRT.
Rintaro: You didn’t tell her anything, did you?
Kurisu: About her death? Of course not.
Rintaro: Good. Don’t hang up yet. ...? What? Why? Well!?
Kurisu: Did you send it?
Rintaro: Yes. Did it work!?
Kurisu: The discharge is occurring as normal.
Rintaro: So it worked, right?
Kurisu: Definitely.
Rintaro: The worldline didn’t change!
Kurisu: You mean it failed? Why?
Rintaro: Maybe the message wasn’t enough to persuade Moeka to change models.
Kurisu: Could we have sent it to the wrong date?
Rintaro: It’s July 31st. I’m sure of it.
Kurisu: Check when the original D-Mail arrived. Maybe her reaction will change if the new one arrives just after that.
Rintaro: What a pain!
Kurisu: Try sending different messages. If that doesn’t work, I’ll adjust the timer.
Rintaro: You’re a lifesaver. What’s going on there? Is Mister Braun freaking out?
Kurisu: I can hear him shouting from below. Hashida and Mayuri are trying to calm him down, but who knows how long that’ll last. I don’t think there’s much time left.
Rintaro: Are you there?
Kurisu: Still not working?
Rintaro: I tried two more times, but nothing.
Kurisu: Okabe? What’s wrong?
Rintaro: Nothing... changed?
Kurisu: Huh? What hasn’t changed?
Rintaro: No way... That sneaky little...! She’s crazy!
Kurisu: Okabe! Okabe!? Answer me!
Rintaro: ...Christina.
Kurisu: What’s that pounding? Are you okay?
Rintaro: Moeka’s D-Mail wasn’t about a model exchange.
Kurisu: What do you mean!?
Rintaro: She must have changed the text right before we sent it. That’s why the cancellation mails aren’t working.
Kurisu: Did you check her history? It might still be there.
Rintaro: Her arrival history... I should have thought of that. Checking now! ...Christina, I seem to be in a spot of trouble. If I fail, I’m leaving the rest to you.
Kurisu: Don’t be ridiculous! If you’re in trouble, then get out of--
