Kurisu: I thought I asked you to keep me posted.
Rintaro: I’ve been busy.
Kurisu: Busy. Right.
Rintaro: Were you worried about me?
Kurisu: O-of course not! Why should I care what you’re up to? It’s just... Mayuri was really worried. I don’t want to see her sad.
Kurisu: So at least give her a call, okay?
Rintaro: I’m doing this to save Mayuri. I’m close to discovering our true enemy.
Kurisu: Our enemy? But... Isn’t she our enemy?
Rintaro: She is an enemy, but we’re cooperating in order to uncover the truth.
Kurisu: Isn’t she the one who... killed Mayuri?
Rintaro: ...Yes.
Kurisu: Whatever. So where are you going now? Take me with you.
Rintaro: Have you gone mad, assistant mine?
Kurisu: I’m perfectly sane, and I’m not your assistant.
Rintaro: It could be dangerous.
Kurisu: Eh... Do I die today?
Rintaro: No. You don’t die.
Kurisu: Then there’s no problem. This worldline has essentially guaranteed my survival.
