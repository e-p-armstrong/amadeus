Kurisu: Fascinating.
Itaru: You believe him, Makise-shi?
Kurisu: In theory. I’d like to see objective data, but that’s obviously impossible.
Rintaro: Relax. Your Time Leap Machine worked perfectly.
Kurisu: O-of course it did. Besides, we were already planning to crack SERN’s database, weren’t we? Fine. Let’s see what’s in there. If the mail data exists, then it’s proof that what you said is true.
Itaru: So what you’re saying is, ’don’t think, feel.’ Got it.
Kurisu: Uh, you lost me.
Rintaro: What he meant to say was, ’don’t think, do.’
Itaru: Done bridging them. I need to tinker with the settings a little, but we should be up and running in about ten minutes.
Rintaro: Alright.
Kurisu: So the first D-Mail started everything... Was that the one you showed me at ATF? The one that said I died or something.
Rintaro: Right. I found you dead at Radi-Kan and sent Daru an email. Daru happened to be experimenting on the PhoneWave (name subject to change) at the time, so the discharge phenomenon occurred and the mail... was... ...!
Kurisu: What? And I’m supposed to choose? There’s no way... I can’t choose... I can’t! Is this how it ends!? Suzuha... Faris... Lukako... Moeka... Is this what I sacrificed your memories for!?
