Kurisu: What did Mayuri say? You’re such a wimp. I’m disappointed in you.
Rintaro: Aren’t you afraid of dying?
Kurisu: Did you not hear what I just said?
Rintaro: I heard, but-- How are you a burden!? Don’t say things like that, dammit! Why is she only serious at times like this!?
Kurisu: A burden, huh...
Rintaro: I’ve never felt Mayuri was a burden. Not once.
Kurisu: Then you should tell her that. Okabe. The old you wouldn’t have worried about anything. Anyway, you should go see Mayuri. I’m sure she has a lot to say.
