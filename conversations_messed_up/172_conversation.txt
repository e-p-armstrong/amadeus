Rintaro: But...
Kurisu: No buts. My answer won’t change. Save Mayuri.
Rintaro: Are you telling me to give up!? To abandon you!? I could never do that!
Kurisu: You can, and you must! There’s no other way.
Rintaro: No! You’re our friend! I won’t abandon you!
Kurisu: Okabe! Is there another solution? There isn’t, is there? I don’t want to live if it means sacrificing Mayuri! If you don’t save her, I’ll never forgive you!
Rintaro: Guh...
Kurisu: Eh...?
Rintaro: But you’re right here! Why does it have to be this way!?
Kurisu: Okabe... Thank you. I know you’re hurting for me. But you’ve done enough. I’m fine, so just think about Mayuri, okay?
Rintaro: ...I’m sorry.
Rintaro: I want to save Mayuri... more than anything. I... can’t save you.
Kurisu: ...I know. Well then. I’m heading back.
Rintaro: Back? Where?
Kurisu: The lab, of course. I need to dry my clothes. I wanna take a shower, too. You stay here and soak for a while. Understand?
