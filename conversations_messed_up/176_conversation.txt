Kurisu: Eh!? Wh-what!?
Rintaro: Do you, uh... How do you feel about me?
Kurisu: Y-you want to know? Close your eyes!
Rintaro: Why close my--
Kurisu: Just shut up and close them! nn...
Rintaro: Wha... wha...
Kurisu: I-it’s not like I did it... because I wanted to or anything. It’s just... you promised... that you wouldn’t forget about me. Research shows that memories are harder to forget when coupled with intense emotions. Y-you’re a virgin and a perv, so I was sure you’d have an elaborative rehearsal on your first kiss, instantly making it a long-term memory you’d never forget... so... I just don’t want you to forget about me, Okabe. No matter what.
Rintaro: S-sorry to disappoint you.
Kurisu: ...eh?
Rintaro: That wasn’t my first kiss.
Kurisu: W-why you... You’re just a cherry boy!
Rintaro: Shut up, virgin.
Kurisu: So it wasn’t your first...
Rintaro: Right. So it only left a weak impression. Probably not enough to become a long-term memory. So, once more.
Kurisu: Wha...
Rintaro: I don’t ever want to forget... so let’s make doubly sure.
Kurisu: Th-then I guess there’s no choice... Just a kiss... okay? Be gentle... okay? Okabe... Mm... Don’t forget me... mm... It’s too fast... Time is going by too fast. I could really use a word with Einstein right now. Time is not absolute. Einstein proved that time could be fast or slow, depending on the observer. Hey, Okabe. The theory of relativity is so romantic... ...and so sad, don’t you think? ...Well then.
Rintaro: Are you sure I shouldn’t call Mayuri and Daru?
Kurisu: ...I think that would just make it harder. But you, I have no trouble leaving behind.
Kurisu: ...That was a joke.
Rintaro: This is a souvenir. Take it.
Kurisu: Uh... no thanks.
Rintaro: Just take it. It’s not even that bulky.
Kurisu: Oh, fine. I guess I’ll take it.
Rintaro: Sorry I couldn’t go with you to Aomori...
Kurisu: Yeah... But these two weeks were fun, in their own way. Give my regards to Mayuri and Hashida, okay? Hang in there, Okabe.
