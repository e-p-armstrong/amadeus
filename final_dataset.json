Prior to this, they've decided to infiltrate the assembly hall, a decision that has led them to this public space, where they aim to blend in while preparing for their daring mission. In the midst of their preparation, Okabe refers to 'Steins Gate', a term known only to a few that signifies a specific world line he's trying to reach - a destiny he believes is guided by fate or divinity. The scene is gripping with suspense as Okabe strives to successfully infiltrate the assembly hall and gather valuable information, while Mayuri supports him in their daring endeavor, all wrapped in an undercurrent of humor due to Okabe's over-the-top acting."
