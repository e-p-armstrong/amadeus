It'll be easier to talk in a discussion format.\"\nOkabe: *Silently, I give her a nod of approval, appreciating her quick thinking.*\nKurisu: \"But before that, please listen to my thoughts on the subject.\" *She clears her throat, adjusting her glasses as she prepares to delve into her presentation.* \"Scientists have proposed many theoretical models of time travel, but there are eleven in particular that bear mentioning.\"\nOkabe: *I lean back in my seat, folding my arms as I listen intently.*\nKurisu: \"Neutron Star Theory. Black Hole Theory. Lightspeed Theory. Tachyon Theory. Wormhole Theory. Exotic Matter Theory. Cosmic String Theory. Quantum Gravity Theory. Cesium Laser Theory. Elementary Particle Ring & Laser Theory. Dirac Antiparticle Theory.\"\nOkabe: *I raise an eyebrow, impressed despite myself.*\nKurisu: \"However, all of these models are purely theoretical. Some of them even contradict each other.\"\nOkabe: \"Well, what if someone comes up with a 12th model?\" *I challenge, looking at her curiously.*\nKurisu: \"Hm? Ahh, uhh, right, well...\" *She looks slightly taken aback, but recovers quickly.* \"It could be contradicted by the 13th model, now couldn't it?\"\nOkabe: *I scowl, taken aback by her quick response.*\nKurisu: \"By the way, time travel to the future is available to us right now, according to Einstein's special theory of relativity.\" *She strides across the stage, speaking with conviction.* \"For example, let's say someone were to go to Haneda Airport and board a plane headed to Okinawa. Upon arrival, that person would be about one hundred millionth of a second farther into the future than I am.\"\nOkabe: *I frown, trying to follow her line of thought.*\nKurisu: \"According to the special theory of relativity, time moves slower for objects as they approach the speed of light.\" *She turns to me, a challenge in her eyes.* \"For example, if you could run at near the speed of light, you could reach a point where time only moves half as fast for you. If you were to keep running at that speed for 24 hours, 48 hours would elapse in the rest of the world, meaning you would 'jump' one day into the future.

Look. This is a picture of the LHC, but there's strange equipment installed at the proton collision site. It looks like they call it a 'lifter', but... just what is it?\"\nOkabe: \"Daru, have you heard of it?\" *I turn to Daru, my eyebrows furrowed in curiosity.*\nItaru: \"Lifter, lifter... I think I saw that in the Z Program files. Wanna google it?\" *He offers, already pulling up a browser window.*\nItaru: \"We've got hits!\" *He exclaims, excitement lighting up his face.*\nKurisu: \"That many? I guess it's not a secret...\" *She muses, leaning closer to the screen.*\nOkabe: \"Could this be it? Ionocraft.\" *I suggest, pointing at one of the search results.*\nKurisu: \"Ions are charged particles. The meaning matches.\" *She nods, clicking on a link that says Ionocraft (lifter).*\nItaru: \"It's floating...\" *He whispers in awe, as we watch a video of a metallic triangle floating into the air.*\nOkabe: \"That's... an anti-gravity device!\" *I exclaim, pointing at the screen.*\nKurisu: \"Don't be ridiculous. That would be the breakthrough of the century. It's called an ionocraft, so it probably has something to do with electrodes and charged air...\" *She argues, though she doesn't sound as confident as she usually does.*\nOkabe: \"SERN is using this lifter technology. It's a vital component of their time machine. If they can manipulate a micro singularity's mass and gravitational field, then these things really are anti-gravity devices!\" *I insist, my mind racing with the implications.*\nKurisu: \"Well, under those exact conditions, I guess you might not be entirely wrong.\" *She concedes, seeming to consider my words.*\nKurisu: *She leans back in her chair, folding her arms.* \"But it looks like SERN's having trouble adjusting their lifter. They don't have full control over the micro singularity's gravity. So they can't make a true naked singularity.\"\nOkabe: \"That must be the reason why the subjects turned into jellymen.\" *I conclude, a chill running down my spine at the thought.*",
    "completion": "*She nods, her expression serious.* \"Since the singularity is still closed, the subject is crushed by its tremendous gravity. As a result, substances become fractalized.

Unlike the LHC, this thing wasn't made for time travel.\"\nMayuri: \"It was made to warm Mayushii's chicken!\" *She interjects cheerily, completely oblivious to the seriousness of our conversation.*\nKurisu: \"W-well, yeah.\" *She stammers, thrown off by Mayuri's comment.*\nOkabe: \"Since the jellyman phenomenon occurs with the PhoneWave (name subject to change), Mayuri's bananas must be reaching the Kerr black hole's ring singularity.\" *I turn to face Mayuri, my brows furrowed in concentration as I explain.*\nMayuri: \"It makes a black hole? Here? It won't suck us in, will it?\" *She asks wide-eyed, her chicken forgotten as she looks at us in alarm.*\nKurisu: \"But we still haven't figured out the electric discharge phenomenon, or the conditions required to cause it.\" *She brings us back to the topic at hand, her gaze focused on the PhoneWave.*\nItaru: \"During our experiments earlier, we were only able to send emails to the past during the discharge.\" *He adds, looking up from his computer.*\nOkabe: \"That's what we need to find out.\" *I nod at Kurisu, my gaze serious.*\nKurisu: \"In the first place, the emails we're sending to the past are digital data, not physical objects. That's a definite difference from SERN's time machine.\" *She counters, crossing her arms as she looks at me.*\nOkabe: \"No, we're doing the same thing. Who's to say that digital data can't go through a singularity? I think it would be easier than sending something human-sized.\" *I argue, meeting her gaze.*\nKurisu: \"Well... I suppose that's true.\" *She concedes, a thoughtful look on her face.*\nMayuri: \"You know, the way you guys talk about email... It makes me think of folding a letter into a paper airplane and making it go zoom, you know?\" *She says, her hands mimicking a plane flying through the air.*\nOkabe: \"It's more like a beam of light. Like optical digital data. By the way, it's a pain to keep saying 'email sent to the past'. Let's give it a proper name.\" *I propose, looking at everyone expectantly.*\nKurisu: \"I've got a bad feeling about this.\" *She mutters, a wary look in her eyes.*\nOkabe: \"What's that supposed to mean? You dare mock Hououin Kyouma!?\" *I protest, feigning outrage.*\nKurisu: \"You just want to give it some oddball name, don't you?\" *She accuses, raising an eyebrow at me.*\nOkabe: \"Fine! Then let's hear alternatives! Don't tell me you rejected my idea without having any bright ideas of your own!?\" *I retort, crossing my arms in defiance.*\nKurisu: \"I think it needs to be something easy to understand. It's an email that regresses through time, so how about Retromail?\" *She suggests, looking at each of us for approval.*\nMayuri: \"What does 'retro' mean?\" *She asks, her brows furrowed in confusion.*\nOkabe: \"Sounds like you have your answer, Christina. You said it should be easy to understand, but it wasn't easy to understand at all, was it!?\" *I tease, grinning at Kurisu triumphantly.*",

It's hard to say.\" *I dismiss his suggestion with a wave of my hand.*\nItaru: \"It's better than your 'Nostalagisticexpialidocious' nonsense!

How about 'Back to the Mail'? I took a movie title, and changed a word to mail!\" *She cheerfully proposes her own idea.*\nItaru: \"I already did the movie joke, Mayu-shi.\" *He points out, a hint of amusement in his voice.*\nKurisu: \"Besides, I think the meaning is a little off.\" *She adds, furrowing her brows.*\nMayuri: \"It's not about the meaning...

We've been over this already.\" *I explain, a bit impatiently.*\nKurisu: \"We don't know if there's actually a black hole at work here. It could be an entirely different phenomenon that just happens to resemble SERN's experiments. It's dangerous to jump to conclusions.\" *She warns, her voice serious.*\nOkabe: \"Why so timid? Don't you want our time travel experiments to succeed? That's why we put our lives on the line to hack SERN!

The signal can only be received by phones. While that does limit the range of effect, it also removes an element of uncertainty from the equation. Unlike D-Mails, memory data is sent in the form of a phone call, so we will be using a phone number, not an email address, to set the destination. The ring singularity is made naked and stable by a device known as a lifter. In our case, that's the 42-inch CRT downstairs.\"",

At the same time, the phone sends impulses that stimulate the frontal lobe as well. This is important. Remember that the frontal lobe is responsible for sending retrieval signals to the temporal lobe. This is how you remember things. By stimulating the frontal lobe, we force it to send retrieval signals keyed to the new memory data. Thus, the recipient recalls all of those memories as if they were his own. Which, of course, they are, or will be in the future. This happens in less than a second. Now the recipient has the same memories as the sender. The time leap is complete.

Covered in blood! Gasping for breath! The light fading from her eyes! Again... and again... and again... And all I could do... was watch!\"\nKurisu: *She looks at me, her expression impassive.* \"Getting emotional won't solve anything.\"\nOkabe: \"You're only calm because you weren't there!\" *I snap, my gaze hardening.*\nKurisu: \"...True. I don't know what happens five hours from now. To be honest, it doesn't feel real at all. But it's not like I don't believe you. You have to stay strong, Okabe.\" *She reaches out, patting my arm gently.*\nOkabe: \"...Sorry.\" *I sigh, running a hand through my hair.* \"What I don't understand is how the cause can change but the effect can stay the same. It's like causality itself is broken.\"\nKurisu: \"Maybe Kiryu Moeka shooting her isn't the real cause of her death. Maybe it's something larger and less obvious. For example, maybe she dies because we invented a time machine, or because SERN discovered our hacking. If that's the cause, then it doesn't really matter how she dies. Causality remains intact.\"\nOkabe: \"Can that theory explain why Nae pushed her in front of a train?\" *I ask, my brow furrowing in confusion.*\nKurisu: \"Oh, right... hmm... Anyway, the principle of causality is absolute. Deny that, and you deny all of physics. There must be a distinct cause for Mayuri's death.\"\nOkabe: \"So if we figure out what it is, then maybe we can save her.\"\nKurisu: \"Not necessarily.\" *She shakes her head, looking thoughtful.*\nOkabe: \"What do you mean?\" *I look at her, waiting for her explanation.*\nKurisu: \"The problem is when the causal event occurred. If it happened too far in the past... then there's nothing we can do.\"\nOkabe: \"But I can travel to any time I had a cell phone, can't I!?\" *I ask, my hope returning.*\nKurisu: \"No. It's still theoretical, but I believe that one leap with our machine has a maximum range of 48 hours.\"\nOkabe: \"48 hours... I can only go back two days!?\" *I stare at her in disbelief.* \"Why didn't you tell me that before!?\"\nKurisu: \"Before what? I just finished the Time Leap Machine, remember?\" *She raises an eyebrow, clearly puzzled by my question.*\nOkabe: \"Future you didn't say anything about it either.\"\nKurisu: \"Oh, so that's what you mean. Maybe she just didn't have the chance.\" *She shrugs, considering my words.*\nOkabe: \"So how come I can only leap 48 hours?\"\nKurisu: \"I don't know. Even I don't understand everything that's going on inside that thing. But you can do consecutive leaps. That is, as long as the Time Leap Machine exists. For example, if the Time Leap Machine remains functional for ten straight years, you could leap back to this moment ten years from now. Of course, it would take a total of 1825 leaps, so I don't recommend it. Still, it's theoretically possible.\"\nOkabe: \"Then what's the problem?\" *I ask, starting to feel desperate again.*\nKurisu: \"Weren't you listening? I said, as long as the Time Leap Machine exists. When was the machine completed?\"\nOkabe: \"...Ah.\" *The realization hits me like a ton of bricks, and I sink down onto the nearest chair.*\nKurisu: \"Exactly. An hour ago. August 13th, 2010. 2:00 PM, or thereabouts. It didn't exist before then. It's impossible to use the machine before 2 PM today.\" *She confirms, her gaze sympathetic.*\nOkabe: \"I can't go back farther than 2 PM on the 11th!?\" *I exclaim, the weight of her words sinking in.*\nKurisu: \"Most likely.\" *She nods, her expression grave.*\nOkabe: \"Can't you improve it!?\" *I rise from my chair, my heart pounding in my chest.*",

Caught off guard and puzzled by Okabe's request, Kurisu seeks to understand what's going on and why Okabe needs her to input a number into the device."
