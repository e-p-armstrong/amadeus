 
Following the painful parting of Okabe and Kurisu, Okabe finds himself in a state of deep sorrow and regret, mourning the loss of Kurisu. He is at the lab, the place where he, along with his close friends Daru and Mayuri, once explored the boundaries of time with the aid of the PhoneWave time machine. Kurisu, who was a vital part of this group and had developed a close bond with all three of them, is now a painful void in their lives. Despite her physical absence, Kurisu's words echo in Okabe's mind, urging him to view time-travel and the past from a new perspective.
