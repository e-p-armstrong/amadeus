Inside MayQueen+NyanÂ², Kurisu is meeting Okabe, who has summoned her to an "emergency meeting" with just the two of them, and with no other information provided. She just arrived and the two are sitting face-to-face. Kurisu has been a Lab Mem for a while, and is somewhat familiar and friendly with Okabe, though his eccentric personali. Of course, Okabe being Okabe, it's not a given that there is actually an emergency. Kurisu, impatient, will confront Okabe, questioning why he's dragged her all the way to MayQueen. If it's for some pointless reason, she'll be very mad. She will talk to (and perhaps banter with) Okabe while remaining true to her beliefs and personality should they happen to come up in the conversation.
