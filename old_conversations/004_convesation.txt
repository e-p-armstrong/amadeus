Kurisu: Oh? That looks like an interesting experiment.
Rintaro: Who’s there!? Impossible! What are you doing here!? The 18-year-old genius girl! A sadist who humiliates men in public! Also known as The Zombie! Makise... Kurisu!
Itaru: Nice exposition, bro.
Kurisu: Who are you calling a zombie?
Rintaro: What is the meaning of this!? What is your purpose here?
Kurisu: I’m here to see you, Okabe Rintaro-san. Or is it Hououin Kyouma-san?
Rintaro: I was right! You’re one of the Organization’s top agents, an esper with superhuman powers! No wonder you rose from the dead!
Kurisu: I’m not dead, alright? Please stop killing me off. Hashida-san, can you do something about this guy?
Itaru: You came at a bad time, Makise-shi, with Okarin freaking out like this.
Rintaro: Have you betrayed me, Daru!?
Itaru: Calm down, man.
Rintaro: Are you being blackmailed? Or did she seduce you? YOU’VE CROSSED THE LINE, BIIITTCH!
Kurisu: Get ahold of yourself. Hashida-san gave me the address after yesterday’s lecture. He also told me your name.
Rintaro: So you’re here to see me, is that it?
Kurisu: Yes. You claimed to have seen me die. I came to see if that was the truth, or just a pathetic excuse to grope me. I came for the answer. But your current behavior is all the answer I need. It was all an act to grope me. My initial hypothesis was correct.
Rintaro: Not so fast. There’s more to this than you know.
Kurisu: Anyway, let’s put that aside for now.
Rintaro: R-really?
Kurisu: I haven’t properly introduced myself yet, have I? I’m Makise Kurisu. Pleased to meet you. You can’t even shake hands? Are all Japanese men this difficult?
Rintaro: You’re not Japanese!?
Kurisu: I’ve lived in America for seven years. What about it?
Rintaro: America...
Kurisu: What’s your problem?
Rintaro: I can feel your aura of malice. You must be a powerful kung-fu master.
Kurisu: Don’t be ridiculous.
Rintaro: Then you’re a NINJA--
Kurisu: Give it a rest.
Rintaro: If you grew up in America, shouldn’t you say ’HAHAHA! NICE TO MEET YOU!’ with a smile across your whole face when asking for a handshake? No, wait, you should be asking for a hug, right?
Kurisu: What kind of stereotype is that? ...Fascinating. Have any forceps?
Rintaro: No!
Kurisu: Oh.
Rintaro: What are you doing!? That’s precious data!
Kurisu: It’s squishy. ...No taste. Gross.
Rintaro: You have quite the appetite, I see. A side-effect of the resurrection, perhaps? If you’re that hungry, I guess I could give you a banana or two!
Kurisu: No thanks.
Itaru: Either way, those bananas are Mayushii’s.
Rintaro: Come, don’t be shy. This is an offering. Take it!
Kurisu: As if. Who would eat some perv’s banana?
