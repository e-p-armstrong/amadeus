Kurisu: Huh? Me?
Rintaro: Who else!?
Kurisu: When did I become your assistant!?
Rintaro: Just send something to my phone!
Kurisu: I don’t even know your email address.
Rintaro: What a useless assistant.
Kurisu: Don’t call me your assistant!
Rintaro: Daru, send an email from your phone!
Itaru: Uh, sure... but what?
Rintaro: Anything!
Itaru: Uhh, umm...
Rintaro: Send ’Christina’s a perv’!
Kurisu: I thought we agreed to stop saying that!
Itaru: Well, let’s compromise and go with ’Okarin’s a perv’.
Rintaro: You traitor!
Kurisu: Good job, Hashida-san!
Mayuri: Oh no! Mayushii’s bananas! They became gelbanas...
Kurisu: We experimented on them.
Mayuri: But they were Mayushii’s...
Itaru: Want me to send the mail now?
Kurisu: You’ll be reimbursed later. By Hououin-san, that is.
