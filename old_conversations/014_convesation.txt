Kurisu: ...I’ve heard enough. No more hallucinating about me, okay? Dying isn’t fun, even if it’s in someone else’s head.
Rintaro: I can’t make any guarantees. That would require perfect 24-hour surveillance inside my brain.
Kurisu: You have a comeback for everything, don’t you. Kyah! What now!?
Rintaro: I’m not done talking!
Kurisu: You trying to pick a fight?
Rintaro: It’s revenge for ruining my farewell scene, Christina! You shall regret your thoughtless actions!
Kurisu: Okay, okay, fine. What is it?
Rintaro: About the IBN 5100.
Kurisu: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Rintaro: ...If you don’t know, then forget about it. Farewell! We will not meet again.
Kurisu: Hey! Don’t tell me to forget about it! What is the IBN five... whatever?
Rintaro: Then IBN 5100. It’s a retro PC from 1975. I’m looking for one.
Kurisu: Yeah? What are you going to do with it?
Rintaro: Interested?
Rintaro: You’re interested, aren’t you?
Kurisu: ...Just a little.
Rintaro: Then I shall answer! The IBN 5100 is the key to unlocking SERN’s most closely guarded secrets.
Kurisu: SERN? You mean... the SERN?
Rintaro: Indeed. Through the tireless efforts of my faithful lab mems, we have uncovered evidence that SERN is researching time travel.
Kurisu: ...Great. I shouldn’t have asked.
