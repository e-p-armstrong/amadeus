Kurisu: Eh?
Rintaro: You should leave.
Kurisu: Why are you suddenly--
Rintaro: The Jellyman’s Report... it just gives me a bad feeling. Once we see it, we can no longer return to our normal lives. You’re a genius. You’re already published, for crying out loud. There’s no need to throw away your promising future.
Kurisu: Are you worried about me?
Rintaro: Of course I am. You are my assistant, after all.
Kurisu: ...I keep telling you, I’m not your assistant. Thanks for your concern. But I’m not leaving. We need to expose this truth to the world.
Rintaro: No! It’s too dangerous.
Kurisu: You chickening out?
Rintaro: We’re powerless against this conspiracy. One wrong move, and they’ll have us erased.
Kurisu: But still--
Rintaro: This isn’t a game! I’m not joking here. ...Fine. I won’t tell anyone. But I’m not leaving. It’ll keep me awake at night.
Rintaro: You won’t regret this?
Kurisu: I won’t.
Rintaro: What about you, Daru? Prepared?
Itaru: Well, I am a super hacker. And with my skills, they’ll never know we were there.
Rintaro: Alright... let’s begin. Henceforth, this shall be known as Operation Laegjarn’s Chest!
Kurisu: Why Norse mythology?
Itaru: Is that Norse mythology? Because it’s cool, I guess.
Kurisu: Anyway, what is it with men and military terms...
Rintaro: Daru, begin the operation!
Itaru: Ready? I’m opening it.
Kurisu: ’Jellyman’s Report 10’ ’Subject: James McCarthy, Age: 31, American’ ’Z Program Stage 4, Date of Experiment: 2005-01-28 T13:05’ ’Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.’
Itaru: That again...
Kurisu: ’It is believed that due to infinite compression by supergravity, the subject could not endure passage through the singularity inside the Kerr black hole.’ ’April 3, 1921. New York City. An unidentified man was discovered dead in an alley off Union Square. The right half of his body was embedded in a nearby wall.’ ’The man’s body... ...was completely gelified.’
Itaru: What’s going on here? They... gelified someone?
Kurisu: They’re experimenting on people... And this means they’ve created a time machine, doesn’t it? Even if it’s not perfect.
Rintaro: Eh...?
Kurisu: This New York Times article is from 1921.
Rintaro: 90 years ago...
Kurisu: Look.
Rintaro: SERN...
Itaru: So... SERN used the LHC to send someone back to 1921?
Kurisu: Looks like they failed to keep him alive, though.
Rintaro: Is this the only report?
Itaru: No, there’s more. Looks like... 14 people in total.
Rintaro: More Jellymen? That means more gelified people... more victims of human experimentation... Show me the others.
Kurisu: ’Jellyman’s Report 9.’ ’Subject: Dan Strayski, Age: 26, Canadian.’ ’Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2004-9-6 T 14:10.’ ’Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.’ The newspaper clipping... I think it’s in French. I can’t read it.
