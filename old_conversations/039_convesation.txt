Kurisu: Idiots. As I keep saying, the real problem is what the PhoneWave uses as a lifter.
Rintaro: That and one other thing. How come the discharge phenomenon and gelification only happen during a certain timeframe?
Itaru: We may not understand everything, but we’ve perfected the art of D-Mailing. Isn’t that our Final Answer?
Mayuri: Sending mail to the past is amazing, isn’t it?
Itaru: Though I guess it’s not a real time machine unless we can send people to the past.
Kurisu: Even SERN has failed to send humans through. If you believe what Titor says, it won’t be another, what, 24 years before there’s a true time machine?
Rintaro: Physical time travel is impossible for us at the moment. We lack the funds and facilities available to SERN. And yet we have realized a form of time travel. We’ve sent data to the past.
Kurisu: We should investigate the PhoneWave further. We need to understand what’s going on.
