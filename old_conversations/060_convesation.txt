Kurisu: I don’t think that’s enough to convince her to--
Mayuri: Oh, that might work!
Kurisu: Eh...?
Mayuri: When I went to the vending machine today, I spent ten minutes wondering if I should get canned oden or canned ramen. It was really hard!
Rintaro: So a little push should be enough to make you choose canned oden! Alright, let’s go with that!
Mayuri: Okay! But before we change the past, I gotta finish this ramen first.
Kurisu: What happens if you don’t finish it?
Mayuri: It’ll go to waste♪
Kurisu: Oh... of course. Ahaha...
Rintaro: PhoneWave (name subject to change), activate!
Mayuri: Aw... I haven’t sent it yet...
Kurisu: So one second isn’t enough for the discharge to occur. That’s what I expected, but it’s good to have proof.
Itaru: What if you try warming it up beforehand?
Kurisu: Warming it up?
Itaru: One second isn’t enough, right? So just run the microwave for about 30 seconds without sending a mail. As soon as it’s done, run it again with the timer set at one second. That should cause the discharge, right?
Kurisu: Any basis for that?
Itaru: Nope.
Rintaro: Damn. Mayuri, got anything else!?
Mayuri: Um, well... we could change the flavor of rice ball I bought last night...
Rintaro: Do you remember what kind of rice ball you ate last night?
Mayuri: Smoked tuna.
Kurisu: She remembers!?
