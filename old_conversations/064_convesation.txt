Kurisu: Can you stop that vulgar laughter? I can hear you from outside. It’s embarrassing.
Mayuri: Chris-chan, tutturu♪
Rintaro: Mmgh!? You come here this late and dare insult me? And you call yourself my assistant!?
Kurisu: I’m not your assistant. Don’t make me repeat myself. Anyway! You’re the worst, toying with such a weak and innocent girl. Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?
Itaru: Toying with a weak and innocent girl, you say?
Kurisu: Don’t react to every little thing, you perv. At any rate...
Rintaro: Christina. Stop eying Lukako’s entire body from top to bottom like that.
Kurisu: I-I wasn’t doing that!
Mayuri: Do you like the costume, Chris-chan? It really suits Luka-kun, dontcha think?
Kurisu: Is this that cosplay thing I’ve heard about? It’s part of Japanimation culture, right? You’re very cute.
Luka: C-c-cute? No way...
Kurisu: Why are you crying? You look perfect, so you should be more confident.
Luka: Uuugh...
Rintaro: Heh heh heh... Lukako! Tell us your wish.
Luka: Eh...?
Kurisu: That’s one hell of an acrobatic topic change.
