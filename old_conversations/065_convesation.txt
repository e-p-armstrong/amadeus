Rintaro: You, assistant! What kind of person laughs at people’s wishes!?
Mayuri: Um, Mayushii’s wish is to eat a ton of of yummy food, and to cover the lab with Upa goods, and to get Luka-kun to wear my costumes--
Rintaro: I’m not asking you.
Mayuri: But Mayushii wants ’Shota in the Gate’ to grant her wish too!
Itaru: ’Shota in the Gate’!? That mistake is god tier. Probably because it’s so... naughty.
Luka: I want... to be a girl.
Kurisu: ...What?
Luka: I don’t really... like how I look... I always thought... that if I were a girl... I could be a little more confident...
Kurisu: Wait. Wait a second. Umm, what did she say?
Rintaro: Heh, heh, heh. Assistant mine -- no, Christina!
Kurisu: I’m not your assistant, and I’m not Christina!
Rintaro: You’ve made a grave error!
Kurisu: I have?
Rintaro: Don’t you understand? No, of course you don’t. How could you, with impure thoughts clouding your eyes!
Kurisu: Wh-what do you mean?
Rintaro: Allow me to explain. You called Lukako here a ’weak and innocent girl.’ But he’s not a girl at all. He’s a guy!
Kurisu: Is that some kind of joke?
Rintaro: It’s not a joke, but the naked truth as described in the Akashic Records! Muhahaha!
Kurisu: ...Are you guys trolling me?
Rintaro: Eh?
Itaru: Eh?
Kurisu: ...Eh? Is what Okabe says true?
Luka: Y-yes... I’m... a guy...
Kurisu: N-no way! Someone this cute can’t be a boy!
Itaru: You’ve got it backwards. You’re supposed to say ’Someone this cute can’t be a girl.’
Kurisu: That’s not what I meant.
Rintaro: Lukako. You’re fine just the way you are. I will not reject you, be you man or be you woman. Nor will anyone else here. And I will not deny your wish. Nor will anyone else here.
Itaru: Why do you keep repeating that last part?
Rintaro: Why, Christina. Is it such a shock to meet a man far more feminine than you?
Kurisu: I admit it. Compared to her... I mean, to him, I’m not as cute, I talk more rudely, and my attitude is worse... This is a three-day-coma level shock.
Mayuri: Chris-chan’s cute too♪
Kurisu: Don’t try to comfort me. It just makes me feel worse.
Rintaro: Admitting your faults is the first step towards becoming stronger. You may one day become a splendid woman, Christina. You’re still young.
Kurisu: Who the hell asked you?
Rintaro: I take it back! You’re a stubborn fool who refuses to face the truth!
Kurisu: Shut up. I don’t want to hear that from you.
Luka: Um... sorry. I shouldn’t have said anything.
Itaru: Welp, better get my trusty digicam...
Kurisu: Don’t try to sneak in a photo session, you perv!
