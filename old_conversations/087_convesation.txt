Rintaro: And that, my fellow lab members, brings us to the question. Can the PhoneWave (name subject to change) beat SERN to true physical time travel?
Kurisu: Two problems. One, setting the destination. Two, the lifter.
Rintaro: We’ve already established that the D-Mail arrives precisely when and where it’s supposed to.
Kurisu: ...It’s dangerous to accept that without verification.
Rintaro: As for the lifter, we already know it exists. We just need to figure out what it is.
Kurisu: I don’t think we’re going to find it. The PhoneWave’s not exactly big, you know, and we’ve been poking at it for days without turning up a clue. Even if we do find it, it’ll take forever to learn how to tune the electron feed properly.
Itaru: How long is forever?
Kurisu: SERN’s been working on it for nine years and they still haven’t solved it.
