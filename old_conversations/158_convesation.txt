Kurisu: ...So the manager was FB.
Rintaro: Hey, Moeka... It’s possible... that FB did what he did so you could live. Maybe he didn’t abandon you. Maybe, by pushing you away, he was trying to keep you safe.
Kurisu: Okabe! We need to send the D-Mail now. Miss this chance, and you could be in a lot of trouble. Your goal is to save Mayuri, not take revenge on SERN. Right? ...I don’t want anyone else to be hurt because of the machine we built.
Rintaro: ...Yeah. You’re right. Do you think Daru’s still in the lab?
Kurisu: I’ll try calling. He said he’ll be there in five minutes. By the way, something weird happened back there. While I was waiting outside, I heard a gunshot. And right after that... I saw her.
Rintaro: Her... who?
Kurisu: Nae-chan. She ran out the back door. When I called her to stop... our eyes met.
