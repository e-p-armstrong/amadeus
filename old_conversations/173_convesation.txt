Kurisu: Thanks for coming to see me off.
Rintaro: Does that suitcase mean what I think it does?
Kurisu: Hm? Oh. Yeah, it does.
Rintaro: You’re going back to America.
Kurisu: I was supposed to go back at the beginning of the month. But then I ran into a certain mad scientist, and ended up staying longer than planned. There’s nothing else I can help you with anyway. And I don’t want to be a liability.
Kurisu: What’s wrong, Mayuri? Are you feeling sick?
Rintaro: C’mon, Mayuri. Chris-chan!
Kurisu: W-whoa, what’s going on!?
