Rintaro: Wh-wh-wha-what are you saying!?
Kurisu: It’s true, isn’t it? It would make him really sad if you died. You don’t want him to be sad, do you?
Mayuri: But if Chris-chan goes away, it’ll make Mayushii sad...
Kurisu: Yeah... I know. It makes me sad too. But this was going to happen eventually. I had to go back to America sooner or later. So even if you move to another worldline, just think of me as being in America. It’s practically the same thing.
Mayuri: That’s not the problem! I don’t want Chris-chan to disappear! Let’s stop this, okay? Don’t make Chris-chan disappear!
Kurisu: You have to listen to us now, Mayuri. Okabe. Don’t ever let go of her again.
Rintaro: ...I know.
Kurisu: Well, I’m off. Thank god I’ll never have to see your silly face again!
Mayuri: Don’t go, Chris-chan! Please, don’t go!
Kurisu: Don’t follow me! I don’t want pity. It will only make it worse. This is my decision. Nothing you can say will change my mind.
Kurisu: ...Goodbye. Promise me, Mayuri. Promise me you’ll find happiness.
