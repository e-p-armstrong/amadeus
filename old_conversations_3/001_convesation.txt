Kurisu: Is there something wrong? O-ow!
Rintaro: Y-you... You should be dead! Why are you here!? And you’re even... Not a scratch...
Kurisu: Hey, that hurts! Let me go! What’s wrong with you?
Rintaro: You’re okay? But that’s impossible! Someone stabbed you! I saw you lying in a pool of blood!
Itaru: That again?
Rintaro: What do you mean, ’again’?
Itaru: I mean, you sent me that email like a week ago, right?
Rintaro: I sent you an email? Don’t be ridiculous! I saw her dead just three hours ago!
Kurisu: Hey! Could you not talk about me like that? I’m perfectly fine.
Itaru: You know, that message was kinda weird. It was dated a week after I got it, which means it came from the future.
Kurisu: It came from the future?
Rintaro: That sounds like something you’d read on the internet, Daru. It’s rare for you to talk about ridiculous theories.
Itaru: No, the date was definitely a week later. It came from, uh... the 28th. Wait. That’s today!
Rintaro: This is the email I sent you three hours ago.
Kurisu: Interesting...
Rintaro: Substance. She has substance. Of course she’s not a ghost. How silly of me.
Itaru: O-Okarin, I don’t think that’s a good idea...
Kurisu: ...Hey. Are you trying to get yourself arrested?
Rintaro: I just want to know the truth.
Kurisu: What truth, you perv!? You stupid!? Wanna die!?
Itaru: Louise-chan’s famous line for the win!
Rintaro: I know what I saw!
Kurisu: No way! Did you just see my underw...!?
Rintaro: No, you fool! Not that! Wait. Doctor Nakabachi?
Itaru: What are you talking about, Okarin? Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation was canceled.
Rintaro: Canceled!?
Itaru: Yeah. Because of the satellite crash.
Kurisu: Excuse me, um...
Rintaro: My name... is Hououin Kyouma!
Itaru: Really, man? You’re hopeless...
Kurisu: Okay, Hououin-san. I’d like to hear your story in more detail.
Professor: Makise-san? It’s almost time.
Kurisu: Huh? Oh, right. Thank you.
Itaru: We should go too.
Rintaro: Go where?
Itaru: To hear the lecture, duh?
Kurisu: Um, I’d like to thank everyone for coming to hear me speak today.
Rintaro: She’s the one giving the lecture...
Kurisu: It’s my first time giving a lecture like this, so please forgive me if I’m a little nervous. For today’s lecture, I’ve been asked to speak on the subject of time travel. It’s not really my area of expertise, but I’ll try my best.
Rintaro: Time travel? Oh-ho...
Kurisu: Let me start by saying that time travel is an absurd concept.
Rintaro: OBJECTION!
Kurisu: Hwa...!?
Rintaro: It’s presumptuous for you to claim that time travel is absurd!
Itaru: Okarin, you magnificent fool!
Kurisu: Um... okay. It’s fine, I guess. It’ll be easier to talk in a discussion format. But before that, please listen to my thoughts on the subject. Scientists have proposed many theoretical models of time travel, but there are eleven in particular that bear mentioning. Neutron Star Theory. Black Hole Theory. Lightspeed Theory.
