Rintaro: I don’t care about your dislocated jaw! Do you accept the conditions or not? Answer me, Christina!
Kurisu: Stop adding -tina! My name’s Kurisu! ...Okay. I accept.
Rintaro: Hehehe, good answer. From this moment forth, you are Lab Mem Number 004. Welcome, Christina -- codename, The Zombie!
Kurisu: I won’t answer to either. Use my real name, Hououin. You’re such a child.
Rintaro: You say something? Genius perv girl?
Kurisu: Come on! No more saying ’perv’! I won’t treat you like a perv either! So let’s drop it already!
Rintaro: As long as you understand. Now for the issue at hand. Daru, give Christina--
Kurisu: No ’-tina’ either.
Rintaro: Give Kurisu-kun an explanation on our experiments so far.
Itaru: But I refuse.
Kurisu: Fascinating.
Rintaro: Let’s hear your opinion.
Kurisu: I think we can at least throw out completely worthless theories like electromagnetic weaponry and teleportation. Can we run the experiment one more time? I want to see it for myself. Okabe-san, Hashida-san, please watch the bananas.
Rintaro: Who are you to give me orders? I am the mad scientist, Houou--
Kurisu: Whatever. Just keep your eye on the bananas! Sixty seconds have passed. Any change?
Itaru: Nope.
Kurisu: 100 seconds.
Itaru: Ah! It appeared!
Rintaro: How does it look?
Kurisu: Huh? Oh... uh... A-at 104 seconds, it d-disappeared. Abruptly. Yeah.
Rintaro: So it is a teleporter! The first in human history! Teleportation... is that even possible? It did move... No matter how unbelievable that may be... Could it be quantum teleportation... no, that only occurs on the quantum level...
Rintaro: Don’t avert your eyes from the truth! What you’ve seen with your own eyes is everything!
Kurisu: Did it really teleport? It’s dangerous to reason from the conclusion.
Rintaro: Well then, genius girl, what do you call this phenomenon? Let’s sort this out. Neither the banana bunch nor the frozen chicken teleported. Correct?
Rintaro: ...So, maybe there’s a size limit for objects that can teleport.
Kurisu: But aren’t those chicken pieces smaller than bananas?
Rintaro: We used the same chicken for each experiment. They come in 12-packs.
Itaru: That’s quite a lot, then.
Kurisu: What about salt? You experimented with salt too, right? Maybe the plate was in the way.
Rintaro: Of course we tried it without the plate, but that didn’t change anything.
Kurisu: Then, maybe each individual grain of salt was too small... or something? Hmm... I need a clue... Anything else? Have you noticed anything else about the PhoneWave?
Rintaro: Not PhoneWave. PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Kurisu: Forget about that. So? Have you noticed anything or not?
Itaru: Oh, right! One time, it shot off a huge electrical discharge.
Rintaro: What!? I don’t know anything about that!
Itaru: That’s because you weren’t around when it happened.
Kurisu: Discharge? How much?
