Kurisu: What, something wrong with that? I spend all my time doing research.
Rintaro: You’re wasting your youth.
Kurisu: I thought so too, until I met you. Now I realize I’m doing just fine.
Luka: Umm, no fighting please...
Rintaro: You’re a lifesaver, Lukako. Thank your father again for me.
Kurisu: Your father is a lovely man.
Luka: Eh... M-my father is m-married... a-ad-adultery... is bad!
Kurisu: Huh?
Rintaro: I see, assistant. So you like older men.
Kurisu: Hey, wait! Don’t misunderstand, you two. That’s not what I meant!
Luka: I-I won’t give up my father...
Kurisu: P-please don’t cry... I just meant I was jealous of how well you get along with your father. That’s all.
Luka: Eh, ah, of course... I’m sorry for the weird misunderstanding! That was so rude of me!
Kurisu: Don’t cry. We’ve resolved the misunderstanding, so it’s all okay.
Rintaro: ...but in the depths of your heart lie feelings for Luka’s dad.
Kurisu: Die.
Rintaro: Lukako, don’t forget your practice swings with Samidare.
Luka: Y-yes sir. I’ll do my best... Umm, El Psy Kongalee...
Rintaro: It’s Kongroo! Don’t forget it.
Luka: I’m sorry!
Kurisu: Hey! What kind of lowlife teases a girl?
Rintaro: Hng! ...Gah, it’s heavy!
Luka: Is it that heavy?
Kurisu: Pathetic. It’s only as big as a CRT monitor.
Rintaro: Then why don’t you try carrying it? Then you’ll understand.
Kurisu: Wheugh...! ...It’s r-really heavy. This thing’s gotta weigh like 30 kilos. Maybe we should’ve borrowed a push cart. Urushibara-san, is there one in the shrine?
Luka: Umm, there is one, but actually, it’s broken... I’m sorry.
Kurisu: Oh. Is there some other place we could borrow--
Rintaro: No, we don’t need a push cart.
Kurisu: Then how are you going to bring it back? It takes about ten minutes to walk to your run-down lab from here.
Rintaro: It may be too heavy for one person, but it’s a different story for two. You and I just need to carry it together. Why else do you think I made you my assistant?
Kurisu: So that’s why... Well, if we carry it together, we might be able to manage, but... But I refuse.
Rintaro: ...huh?
Kurisu: I... I said ’no!’
Rintaro: I’m pretty sure you said ’but I refuse.’
Kurisu: Sh-shut up. I said no. The whole reason you made me a lab mem was to ’borrow my knowledge’. From this, it is elementary to derive the following: ’I won’t do physical labor.’
Rintaro: I see. Then I guess I have no choice. I’ll do my best to carry it, but...
Luka: Um, th-then, I will...
Kurisu: Eh? You’re going to help? Will you be okay?
