Kurisu: Eh? Wha!?
Rintaro: Muhahaha! Don’t you know, Christina? This is what you call a Japanese Gag!
Kurisu: You sneaky...
Rintaro: Thanks for the backup, Lukako! Now that that’s settled, my assistant will help me carry the computer, so you don’t have to help. Thanks for the offer.
Luka: Ah, okay... if that’s how it is, then...
Rintaro: Now, assistant! Since you volunteered, I won’t let you refuse. Grab hold and heave!
Kurisu: ...Fine. Why do we have to be face to face?
Rintaro: Let’s just go.
Kurisu: Hey! Stop stop stop! I said stop!
Rintaro: You’re a noisy one.
Kurisu: Don’t walk forwards. Then I have to walk backwards. Let’s walk sideways.
Rintaro: Whatever. Get moving, assistant.
Kurisu: Hey, listen, please, just listen! I can’t walk backwards!
Rintaro: Of course you can. You’re my assistant.
Kurisu: I appreciate the vote of confidence, but I can’t! I’m asking you to go sideways! No, I’m telling you to go sideways! Sideways! I’m going to fall! Haah, we finally made it... I’m exhausted...
Rintaro: If you didn’t complain so much about every little thing, we would’ve gotten here sooner.
Kurisu: Right back at you. You stopped to take a break at least five times along the way. That’s because I wasn’t feeling well...
Kurisu: Are you okay?
Rintaro: It’s just... occasionally, my right arm aches... and when it does, dark destructive impulses overcome my soul--
Kurisu: Shut up, or I’ll tear the peripheral nerves out of that arm. Shouldn’t you get your friends to help?
Rintaro: You’re right.
Suzuha: Huh? If it isn’t Okabe Rintaro. What’cha got there?
Rintaro: Hmph, you want to know? Then I’ll tell you!
Kurisu: Wait! If you’re just going to stand and talk, shouldn’t we put the box down first?
Rintaro: Y-yeah... actually, wait, this will only take a second.
Suzuha: Well? What is it?
Rintaro: What if I told you... it’s an IBN 5100?
Suzuha: No way! You found it!? Wow! Way to go, Okabe Rintaro! Where was it?
Kurisu: Ugh, it’s heavy...
Rintaro: Let’s put it down!
Kurisu: Haah...
Suzuha: So, where was it?
Rintaro: Yanabayashi Shrine.
Suzuha: Yanabayashi Shrine? You mean like a Shinto shrine?
Rintaro: Yeah.
Suzuha: Why was it there... Ah...!
Kurisu: Y-yes?
Suzuha: Makise Kurisu?
Kurisu: Yes...?
Kurisu: What is it? Have I done something wrong?
Suzuha: ...Hmph.
Kurisu: Who was that?
Rintaro: She works part-time at that store.
Kurisu: Why was she glaring at me?
Rintaro: How should I know? Did you do something to make her angry?
Kurisu: I’ve never seen her before in my life. How rude.
Rintaro: Good work, everyone. With this, we can fight.
Kurisu: Who are you fighting?
Rintaro: SERN, and the system that rules the world.
Kurisu: If that’s what makes you happy...
