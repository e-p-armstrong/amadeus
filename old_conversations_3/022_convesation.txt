Rintaro: You interested, Christina?
Kurisu: I’m not Christina, and I’m not interested. If you don’t want to tell me, then I don’t really care.
Rintaro: This artifact is needed for the war against SERN.
Kurisu: War? SERN’s a research institution.
Rintaro: Ostensibly, yes.
Kurisu: ...What are you trying to do? Depending on the situation, I could turn you over to the police, you know?
Rintaro: Hmph, the police? Do you really think a mad scientist like me is afraid of the police? I’ve spent my life on the run from the Organization, a more fearsome enemy than you can possibly imagine.
Kurisu: You can’t be serious. Tell me what you’re trying to do.
