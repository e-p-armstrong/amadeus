Rintaro: Don’t want any? Well, since you have lived in America for so long, I guess you’d prefer fast food instead--
Kurisu: Cup noodles.
Rintaro: What?
Kurisu: I’ll have cup noodles.
Rintaro: Cup noodles!?
Kurisu: What flavors?
Rintaro: There’s soy sauce flavor and chicken flavor.
Kurisu: Chicken. Also... do you have a fork?
Rintaro: Christina, is it okay to stay here this late? Perhaps you should contact your family.
Kurisu: No need.
Rintaro: What? Do your parents let you do whatever you want?
Kurisu: I haven’t seen my father in seven years. My mother is in America. I’m living in a hotel right now. Understand?
Rintaro: Wha...! You damn celebrity! If you’re American, then you should at least use a motel instead of a hotel, right!?
Kurisu: I’m not American, and there aren’t any motels in the heart of Tokyo.
Rintaro: What sort of hotel?
Kurisu: What do you mean? It’s a normal hotel in Ochanomizu.
Rintaro: Ochanomizu? Then you can walk there from here, can’t you?
Kurisu: Sure.
Rintaro: So, tell me about your father.
Kurisu: Sorry?
Rintaro: You said you haven’t seen him in seven years?
Kurisu: Why do you care about my father?
Rintaro: You’re the one who mentioned him. Isn’t that basically a hidden message saying ’please give me some advice about my father, please’?
Kurisu: You’re crazy.
Rintaro: You are my assistant! And I can’t let my assistant have any worries. So tell me everything that’s on your mind!
Rintaro: What’s wrong?
Kurisu: I have nothing to say to you.
Rintaro: Oh, I know! Your father was a hero, but then he fell to evil and now he wears a black mask and cape and goes ’heeeee koohhh’, right!? And in the future, you two are destined to fight and--
Rintaro: ...Y-you’re really mad at me, aren’t you?
Kurisu: Don’t make fun... Of people’s family issues like that. You’re trampling on my heart.
