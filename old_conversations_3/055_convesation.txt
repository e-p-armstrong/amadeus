Kurisu: Okabe. You’re grinning.
Rintaro: ...!! N-nonsense, Celeb Sev!
Kurisu: Don’t call me Celeb Sev!
Kurisu: You look like a girl in love waiting for an email from her boyfriend.
Rintaro: Are you really that desperate for attention?
Kurisu: Just getting revenge. You’re always making fun of me, so I deserve at least this much.
Rintaro: Despite what you may think, I actually respect you.
Kurisu: That’s rich. You don’t even say my name right.
Rintaro: I’m sorry about that.
Kurisu: Well, that’s unexpected... You actually apologized.
Rintaro: I do apologize. But I can’t help it. For my brain has recorded you as my assistant, Christina, and I cannot correct it! MUHAHAHAHA!
Kurisu: I’m gonna crack your skull open and stick electrodes in your hippocampus. Who are you talking to?
Rintaro: John Titor.
Kurisu: Huh? No way.
Rintaro: He’s open to discussion as long as you’re not trying to troll him, and his mail address is public. This is the second time we’ve exchanged mails.
Kurisu: No wonder you keep referencing Titor’s posts. You believe him, don’t you?
Rintaro: Not entirely. But there are several points in his story I do agree with.
Kurisu: Really? I can’t see it as anything but fiction. Muhahahahaha!
Kurisu: D-don’t just start laughing like that. It’s creepy.
Rintaro: Hehehe, but I must! He says I have powers! Isn’t that rich!? You don’t have to tell me what I already know, John Titor! My true power... is the magic eye, ’Reading Steiner’!
Kurisu: Sounds to me like you’ve got a bad case of chuunibyou.
Rintaro: Eh?
Kurisu: Eh...? ...Tch. John Titor is a fraud! Me, the Messiah? Hmph. Ludicrous! To think that I would save humanity! I am no Messiah! I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, who has walked through fire and bathed in an ocean of blood to escape the clutches of the Organization! My desire is chaos unending. Do you think that destroying the System will bring peace to the world? The answer is no! No, I say!
