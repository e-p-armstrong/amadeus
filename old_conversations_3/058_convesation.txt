Rintaro: More like he wants to eat Faris’s home cooking that badly.
Itaru: That’s my Final Answer.
Rintaro: Oh...?
Kurisu: ...Out of time?
Rintaro: Looks like it.
Itaru: But my advice was perfect...
Rintaro: There’s nothing we can do about it. We’ll postpone the experiment till tomorrow.
Kurisu: After I left yesterday, I was thinking. How exactly does the PhoneWave make time travel possible?
Rintaro: It works like the LHC. Didn’t you say the LHC was like a giant microwave?
Kurisu: If every microwave could turn into the LHC, then Japan would have black holes popping up everywhere.
Itaru: Whoa, that sounds worse than earthquakes.
Kurisu: I know it looks like SERN is able to create Kerr black holes willy-nilly, but that’s not supposed to be possible. You can’t just press a button and make a black hole. Even if you could, the risks would be unthinkable. It’s ridiculous to suggest that a household microwave could generate a black hole. My point is that there has to be something else going on here. Some outside source must be injecting electrons into this microwave. Well, I’m going back to my hotel. I’ve had enough of this filthy man cave. See you tomorrow. Don’t forget to write that report.
