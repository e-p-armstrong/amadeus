Kurisu: What? You called me all the way to Japan, and now you-- ...I knew it. You never wanted to see me, did you? ...sniff. Why did you ask me to come here, then? Can you at least tell me tha-- I... I...
Rintaro: Y-yeah?
Kurisu: I wasn’t crying or anything, okay!?
Rintaro: No, you were definitely crying.
Kurisu: Don’t be ridiculous! Where’s your proof!?
Rintaro: Your eyes are red.
Kurisu: Ugh... I wasn’t crying, okay!?
Rintaro: You’re not being very logical, Christina.
Kurisu: Anyway, I wasn’t crying. Understand? End of discussion. Sniff.
Rintaro: Christina.
Kurisu: Shut up. Don’t talk to me.
Rintaro: Listen. You don’t have to talk. Just listen. If there’s something troubling you, I’ll do everything in my power to help.
Kurisu: ...Eh?
Rintaro: And it’s not just me. I’m sure I speak for Mayuri and Daru as well. So don’t hesitate to come to us. When you want to cry, don’t hold it in. Just let it out. We won’t reject you. We’ll hear you out.
Kurisu: Why...
Rintaro: Because you’re important to us. You’re our friend.
Kurisu: Ah... yeah... ...I’m sorry. I was a little upset.
Rintaro: You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. Just tell me when you’re ready. I’ll hear you out.
Kurisu: ...Okay.
