Kurisu: Hey, Okabe. How long are you gonna make me wait?
Mayuri: Um, Okarin, it’s probably something private, so I don’t think you should pry...
Rintaro: Mmmgh...
Kurisu: Okabe? If you’re not gonna send anything, I’m hanging up.
Rintaro: W-wait! Fine. Activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
Kurisu: The discharge is starting.
