Kurisu: Umm... seven years.
Rintaro: If nothing has changed in seven years, then maybe it will take twice that much time.
Kurisu: I... guess you’re right.
Rintaro: Well? When are you going to see him?
Kurisu: ...Huh?
Rintaro: I assume it’ll be during summer break. Make sure you let me know ahead of time.
Kurisu: Wha-wha-wha-what are you talking about!?
Rintaro: I might have plans. I’ll need to shift my schedule around.
Kurisu: Hold on a second! Don’t tell me you plan on coming along!?
Rintaro: Of course I do. You are my assistant, and I will do whatever it takes to ensure that you are in peak mental condition for the experiment. Ok, you’ve had your fun. I’m in no mood for--
Rintaro: I’m being completely serious.
Rintaro: I’ll go anywhere you want -- anywhere in Japan. I’d go anywhere in the world, but I don’t have a passport or money.
Kurisu: Okabe...
Rintaro: You’re afraid you won’t know what to say, right?
Kurisu: Yeah...
Rintaro: Then that settles it. I am a master of conversation. You will have nothing to fear with Hououin Kyouma at your side!
Kurisu: ...pfft!
Rintaro: Why are you laughing!?
Kurisu: You couldn’t hold a normal conversation if your life depended on it.
Rintaro: Ah...
Kurisu: But... thanks anyway. I definitely didn’t expect you to offer to come... N-not that I’m happy about it or anything! I hate how you act like a nice guy sometimes! It’s confusing! Um, Okabe? That offer... I can take you up on it, right?
Rintaro: Of course.
Kurisu: Then, once we’re done upgrading the PhoneWave... I want you to come with me.
Rintaro: As you wish. Where is your father, anyway?
Kurisu: Aomori.
Rintaro: Aomori!?
Kurisu: That’s where he lives now. What? You’re not going to back out, are you? You already promised. I’m taking you whether you like it or not, okay!?
