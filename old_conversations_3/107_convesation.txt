Rintaro: I’m going back!
Kurisu: But what if it fails!?
Rintaro: Get the machine started!
Suzuha: Okabe Rintaro! One of them’s headed your way!
Moeka: Kill them! Don’t let them use it!
Kurisu: Are you sure, Okabe!? Are you sure about this!? Really!?
Rintaro: Do it, Kurisu! Activate the machine! Please! Give me one more chance! Ah! ...Gh. ...It worked again.
Kurisu: Kya! You surprised me! Don’t startle me like that.
Rintaro: Daru! Is it just before 5 on the 13th!?
Itaru: Eh? Um... yeah?
Rintaro: You’re a genius.
Kurisu: W-what’s gotten in to you? Stop manhandling me. It’s gross.
Mayuri: Tutturu♪ Mayushii here.
Rintaro: Mayuri! Where are--
Mayuri: But I can’t answer the phone right now. Please leave your message after the beep♪
Rintaro: Mayuri! Contact me at once! Okay? At once!
Kurisu: Okabe? You look kind of crazy. What’s wrong?
Rintaro: Both of you get out of here. Now.
Kurisu: ...What’s this about? Is this another one of your fantasies? Okabe! Where are you going? Hey!
