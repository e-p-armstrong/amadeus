Kurisu: What’s all the commotion?
Rintaro: Daru. Assistant. Leave right now and get as far from Akiba as you can. But under no circumstances use the train.
Itaru: What? Why?
Rintaro: If you can, go somewhere you don’t normally go, and stay there overnight. Understand?
Itaru: Wait, overnight? So you’re saying we should go to a love hotel and make hanky panky. I understand.
Kurisu: Shut it, perv. What’s going on, Okabe?
