Rintaro: ...Ah.
Kurisu: Exactly. An hour ago. August 13th, 2010. 2:00 PM, or thereabouts. It didn’t exist before then. It’s impossible to use the machine before 2 PM today.
Rintaro: So what you’re saying is... I can’t go back farther than 2 PM on the 11th!?
Kurisu: Most likely.
Rintaro: Can’t you improve it!?
Kurisu: Eventually, maybe, but certainly not now. I’d need a real laboratory with real equipment. It would be expensive, which means we’d need sponsors. And if we go looking, I’m pretty sure SERN would crush us. I’d say that’s proven by the fact that neither you nor I have leapt here from the far future yet.
Rintaro: We can’t do anything!? Even with the Time Leap Machine, we can’t stop SERN from killing Mayuri five hours from now!? ...Huh? Hey!
Kurisu: Hey! Where are you going!?
