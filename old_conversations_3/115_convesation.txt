Kurisu: A society where every activity is controlled by the government. In a dystopia, you’re not allowed to eat bananas unless today is banana-eating day. If you break that rule, they throw you in jail without a trial.
Mayuri: That’s terrible! Mayushii loves bananas...
Suzuha: I’m part of the Resistance fighting to free humanity from SERN’s control. I came to the past to change my present. From your point of view, I guess I should say the future. To change the future.
Mayuri: Um, what about finding your father? Was that a lie?
Kurisu: SERN is a research institution. They don’t have political power. I explained that to John Titor several times online.
Rintaro: ...Wait, don’t tell me. You’re ’KuriGohan and Kamehameha’!?
Kurisu: Titor came forward, so it’s only fair that I do too.
