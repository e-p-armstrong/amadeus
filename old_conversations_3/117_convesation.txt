Rintaro: Attractor Fields...
Suzuha: Right. I told you by mail, didn’t I?
Kurisu: What sort of model is that?
Suzuha: The universe is made up of worldlines and attractor fields. The universe is like this piece of yarn. Countless possible worldlines exist side by side, branching out to infinity. From a distance, it looks like a single string, but when you look closer, the string is actually made up of individual threads woven together. At the end, those threads converge on a single point. The paths are different, but the destination is the same.
Kurisu: Isn’t that determinism?
