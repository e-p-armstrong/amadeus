Kurisu: Welcome back. From the looks on your faces, I guess you didn’t find anything.
Rintaro: Where’s Daru?
Kurisu: He hasn’t come back yet. It’s already dark, so maybe he went straight home?
Suzuha: I feel bad. There’s no time for this...
Rintaro: It’s not for you. We’re doing it to save Mayuri.
Suzuha: ...Yeah.
Rintaro: Is it SERN!?
Kurisu: Good morning.
Rintaro: ...You came to wake me up? Thanks.
Kurisu: I didn’t do it for you.
