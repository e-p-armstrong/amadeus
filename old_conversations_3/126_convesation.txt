Kurisu: Done.
Suzuha: So that’s the Time Leap Machine... It makes you remember the future, right? That’s pretty interesting. Intuition... sixth sense... deja vu... I wonder if those things are actually you recalling future memories. Some of SERN’s researchers in my time came up with the theory that memories are a way of sharing information across worldlines. Maybe it’s similar to that.
Kurisu: I just wish we knew more about Okabe’s Reading Steiner thing. Is it unique to Okabe? Or does everyone have the potential for it, and Okabe’s is just stronger by coincidence?
Rintaro: One thing’s for certain. My consciousness leaps to the past along with my memories.
Kurisu: I still don’t understand why that is. It would make more sense if you experienced a change in the present, like you do when we send a D-Mail. Does your consciousness depend on your memories?
Suzuha: The problem is that consciousness doesn’t have a form that we can see. Same goes for the soul. Those things are still in the realm of religion. Even in 2036, the existence of the soul hasn’t been proven, and nobody’s proven what forms consciousness, either.
Kurisu: I see... that’s a little disappointing.
