Kurisu: ...see? You’re shaking. We’ve only been at it for two days and you’re already exhausted. We still have plenty of time to find the pin. You don’t have to be in such a hurry. If you collapse, what then? I won’t be worried about you, but Mayuri sure will. Take care of yourself. Got it? Yeah... got it.
Mayuri: The weather’s so nice!
Itaru: Whew, hee, why did I have to come along?
Kurisu: Same... here... haah, whew... the wind’s... too strong...
Mayuri: You’re a little chubby, Daru-kun. I think you need to exercise more!
Itaru: Fat neckbeard master race...
Suzuha: What a view! I thought this trip would be a waste of time at first, but I guess people need to take a break once in a while!
Kurisu: I’d rather... be working... on the time leap machine...
