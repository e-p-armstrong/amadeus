Kurisu: So you’re the devoted type, huh?
Rintaro: What’s that supposed to mean?
Kurisu: All of a sudden, you’re treating Mayuri like a princess. Today you went to the station to meet her, you taste tested her lunch, and then you held her hand all the way back to the lab.
Mayuri: Okarin really loves Mayushii! Ehehe!
Kurisu: So what’s the deal?
Rintaro: I don’t follow.
Kurisu: Are you a couple or what? I’ve been meaning to ask.
Rintaro: Do we look like a couple?
Kurisu: Huh!? Uh... well... umm...
Mayuri: You know, Okarin and Mayushii have been friends since we were little♪ Mwawoohii’s weeally hwawy nawo.
Rintaro: Don’t talk with your mouth full.
Kurisu: So... you’re not a couple. Oh. Well, of course! No one would willingly date Okabe, after all.
Rintaro: Pff. You disappoint me, Christina!
Kurisu: Hah? What are you talking about?
Rintaro: You have finally revealed your true nature. I saw how your eyes lit up at the first hint of romance! You’re nothing but a filthy mainstream girl! I bet you like to eat chocolate with your girlfriends and giggle about the latest celebrity love affair! Absurd! This lab has no need of the puppies and flowers in your head!
Kurisu: What the hell are you on about, you self-proclaimed mad scientist chuunibyou nutcase?
Suzuha: The universe is like this piece of yarn. Countless possible worldlines exist side by side, branching out to infinity. When the meter reads over 1%, you’ve made it to the Beta worldline. If you escape the Alpha attractor field and reach the Beta worldline... then the result will change. Reach 1% divergence... and you’ll save Shiina Mayuri.
Kurisu: Okabe. Didn’t you say we weren’t going to experiment with the Time Leap Machine?
Rintaro: This is just in case.
Kurisu: In case what?
