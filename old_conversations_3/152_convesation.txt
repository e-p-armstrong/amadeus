Kurisu: Is there more tomorrow?
Mayuri: Yeah, and the day after, too. Okeydokey! Mayushii’s got an early day tomorrow, so I’m going home. Hey guys, why don’t you come too?
Rintaro: I’ll pass, but my assistant looks like she wants to go.
Kurisu: What!? Hey! Don’t put words in my mouth!
Rintaro: I saw your eyes sparkling while you listened to Mayuri’s cosplay stories.
Kurisu: Maybe, but nobody said anything about going.
Mayuri: Come on, Chris-chan!
Kurisu: No way. I’d suffocate in a crowd like that.
Mayuri: It’s not as crowded on day two! If you’re worried, come in the afternoon. All the popular stuff will be sold out, though.
Kurisu: You go, Okabe. You’re Mayuri’s guardian, aren’t you?
Mayuri: No, Mayushii is Okarin’s hostage!
Kurisu: Oh, right. That’s what it was. Well you don’t want your hostage to escape, do you? Shouldn’t you take her along in handcuffs or something?
Rintaro: I’ve got business in Akiba.
Kurisu: What do you mean, business?
Kurisu: No answer? I guess it was just an excuse.
Rintaro: Christina. We need to talk.
Kurisu: Again? Abrupt as usual.
Rintaro: Hm? What do you mean, again?
Kurisu: Nothing.
