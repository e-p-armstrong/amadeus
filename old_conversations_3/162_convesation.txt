Kurisu: Okabe! What happened!? Are you okay!?
Rintaro: The phone...
Kurisu: I brought it, but... Hey, tell me what happened, will you!? Should I call an ambulance!?
Rintaro: Calm down... I’m gonna send the D-Mail now.
Kurisu: R-right. If the worldline changes, then this wound will go away.
Rintaro: Hey... why do you think Tennouji didn’t kill Moeka?
Kurisu: What do you mean?
