Rintaro: Coincidence... Hey... you didn’t time leap, did you?
Kurisu: So now you’re saying that I went back in time for the sole purpose of repairing your stupid lab coat. Uh-huh. Ridiculous. Ridiculous! There. It’s so important I said it twice. Comprendes?
Rintaro: You’re right. If you had time leaped, you would’ve brought a towel, not a sewing kit.
Kurisu: What’s that, sarcasm? All you do is complain. Here.
Rintaro: Thanks.
Kurisu: Um, by the way... it was dark, so I couldn’t really see. If it turns out bad, it’s not my fault. It was dark. That’s all. Oh, and I hope you like the color. Because I have no idea which thread I used.
Rintaro: It’s... random?
Kurisu: Black, red, or pink. Those are the three possibilities.
Rintaro: Let’s just hope it’s not pink...
Kurisu: Achoo!
Rintaro: Cold?
Kurisu: I guess.
Rintaro: Take my coat.
Kurisu: But it’s wet.
Rintaro: Well, yeah, but... ...Have you made your decision yet?
Kurisu: Sigh... You still haven’t made up your mind? You like Mayuri, don’t you?
Rintaro: What?
Kurisu: It’s probably just my imagination, but lately, I’ve been seeing things. Like a strange sort of deja vu. In these visions, you’re fighting to save Mayuri all by yourself. You never give up, no matter how much it hurts.
Kurisu: Then you come to me for help. You’re so desperate, so earnest, that I just have to do what I can. N-not that I’m doing it for you, okay!? I just want to save Mayuri, that’s all.
Kurisu: Anyway, these images are stuck in my head, like memories. I tried self-analysis. Maybe I’m mistaking dreams for reality, projecting my hopes and fantasies... I don’t know. But there’s one thing I do know. You have to save Mayuri.
Rintaro: ...Aren’t you afraid? You know, it kinda feels like we’re trapped in an ancient ruin. Like the world ended... And we’re the only two people left.
Kurisu: I’ve been thinking. Say you go to the Beta worldline, and everyone else goes with you. What if I can’t go with you? What if I’m the only one left behind? Would the entire world become like this place? It’s just a theory... but I can’t help but wonder.
Rintaro: I... I’ll save you. Not just Mayuri, but--
Kurisu: Don’t make promises you can’t keep! You asked me if I wasn’t afraid. ...Of course I’m afraid. Maybe I’ll disappear. Maybe I’ll be left behind all alone. Or maybe only you will disappear and everything else will stay the same. The world will continue, and nobody will even know that you existed. I’ll go back to America as if nothing ever happened. Maybe... maybe... maybe! I feel hopeless, just thinking about all the possibilities. But even so! Do you think I would tell you to let Mayuri die!?
Rintaro: Kurisu...
Kurisu: Jesus, it’s cold! It’s because of these wet clothes! This sucks.
