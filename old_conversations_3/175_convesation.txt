Kurisu: ...Kuh! This is ridiculous! You... motherfucker!
Rintaro: Whoa!
Kurisu: I said I was fine! What do you mean you won’t give up!? Are you stupid? Wanna die? Are you trying to be a hero, you chuunibyou wackjob? Don’t make promises you can’t keep! Your stupidity is infuriating! Why can’t you just do as I say!?
Rintaro: I...
Kurisu: What’s the problem, huh!? If you weigh the options logically, saving Mayuri is the only--
Rintaro: Fuck logic!
Kurisu: ...!
Rintaro: I’m not God! Maybe I got close, but that’s not me! I can’t decide who lives and who dies anymore! This time...
Kurisu: Hmph! There’s nothing you can do. It’s the choice of Steins Gate. Isn’t that what you always say? The equation is proven, Okabe. There’s no escape. You’re just one man. No matter how hard you try, you can’t overcome the will of the universe.
Rintaro: I know... but I’m still going to try!
Kurisu: Kuh... Have it your way! But I’m not helping. I’m going back to America, and that’s that. Goodbye. I don’t expect we’ll meet again, Hououin Kyouma.
Rintaro: Kuh...
Kurisu: I can’t believe this! How stupid can you be? You’re so... stupid! Running away?
Rintaro: Why...
Kurisu: Time leaping is just running away. I’ve hurt people... lots of people... just to save Mayuri. And yet, I don’t even feel guilty anymore. I feel like I’m losing my humanity.
Kurisu: Then why are you hesitating now?
Rintaro: ...Maybe because my insurance, the Time Leap Machine, isn’t effective. Or maybe I just haven’t mastered it yet. Maybe I haven’t tapped into its full potential.
Kurisu: Running only makes it hurt more. I should know. Look at yourself, Okabe. You look like you’ve aged a decade. Your heart can’t take it anymore. You don’t need to beat yourself up like this. Just accept the truth. Like I said, you can’t stay here. Go to the Beta worldline. Go to the world where Mayuri doesn’t die. Not just for your sake, but for mine as well. Thank you. I know you’re hurting for me.
Rintaro: I... ...can’t save you. I’m sorry... Why does it have to be you? Why!?
Kurisu: Hey, Okabe. Once you go to the Beta worldline, Mayuri and Hashida will forget the time we spent together, right?
Kurisu: Will you... remember me?
Rintaro: Of course I’ll remember you. Of course I will! There’s no way I could ever forget the girl most important to me!
Kurisu: Eh? Y-you mean... Wh-what the hell are you saying!?
Rintaro: The truth.
Kurisu: B-but... proof. I need proof. I can’t come up with a formula otherwise! When the anterior pituitary gland hypersecretes ACTH, and gamma waves induce stochastic resonance, we can assume an infinite Hausdorff dimension for the Hilbert curve. That is, we can measure the asymptotic line with positron emission tomography...?
