Kurisu: Um, do I know you?
Rintaro: No...
Kurisu: You came down from the roof just now, didn’t you? I heard a strange sound from the roof. Is that why the building shook just now? What’s going on? It’s not Doctor Nakabachi’s doing, is it?
Kurisu: Are you listening? You’re sweating like crazy. Hey! Please answer my question! ...Answer me. Can I--
Kurisu: Can you... what?
Kurisu: W-wait! Stop!
Rintaro: Who the hell am I!? Someone who knows you for a fraud, that’s who!
Nakabachi: S-someone throw that man out!
Rintaro: ...Haah. ...I wanted to talk.
Rintaro: ...!?
Suzuha: Oh, one more thing. Watch out for Doctor Nakabachi.
Kurisu: Are you listening, Papa?
Nakabachi: What is that?
Kurisu: I heard you were giving a presentation on time travel. So I thought about it too. Could it be possible to make a time machine? I’d like your opinion, Papa. We can polish it together, then submit it to the scientific community. I don’t know if they’ll listen, but just in case, I do have acquaintances at Science Magazine.
Suzuha: It started with a race between the EU and Russia. Then America got involved, and things really went to hell.
Nakabachi: Did I ask you to write this?
Kurisu: Well... no, but... You invited me to come, remember? It was the first time we’d talked in seven years. That’s what got me thinking. And as I worked on the thesis, I started to realize it might actually be possible to build a time machine.  If the thesis is published, you could have your revenge on the scientific community for shunning you--
Nakabachi: I wasn’t shunned! Those incompetent bastards were just jealous of my superiority. I was the one who gave up on them!
Kurisu: Please don’t yell... You read really fast, Papa. Just like I remember.
Nakabachi: ...Not bad.
Kurisu: You think so? We can submit it jointly, if you like. I don’t mind.
Nakabachi: No, don’t do anything. I’ll take care of it.
Kurisu: ...What do you mean?
Nakabachi: What do I mean? I mean don’t think you’re special just because you got your plebeian thesis published in some magazine!
Nakabachi: What? Is that how you look at your father!?
Kurisu: I’m sorry... Um... we haven’t seen each other in a while. There’s a lot I want to talk about. You’re living in Aomori now, right? I think... my father hates me.
Nakabachi: Leave.
Kurisu: Eh...
Nakabachi: Go back to America. Never show your face to me again!
Kurisu: But--
Nakabachi: You want my opinion!? We’ll submit it jointly!? You don’t mean any of that! I know how you think! Is this pity!? How dare you!? You’re supposed to be my daughter!
Kurisu: I... I don’t understand. Please calm--
