Kurisu: ...I wanted to talk.
Kurisu: Are you listening, Papa?
Nakabachi: What is that?
Kurisu: I heard you were giving a presentation on time travel. So I thought about it too. Could it be possible to make a time machine?
Rintaro: ...!?
Nakabachi: I wasn’t shunned! Those incompetent bastards were just jealous of my superiority. I was the one who gave up on them!
Kurisu: Please don’t yell... Um... we haven’t seen each other in a while. There’s a lot I want to talk about. You’re living in Aomori now, right?
Nakabachi: Leave.
Kurisu: Eh...
Nakabachi: Go back to America. Never show your face to me again.
Kurisu: But--
Nakabachi: You want my opinion!? We’ll submit it jointly!? You don’t mean any of that! I know how you think! Is this pity!? How dare you!? You’re supposed to be my daughter!
Kurisu: I... I don’t understand. Please calm--
Nakabachi: I am calm! Don’t tell me what to do! I’ll tell you why I called you here today. I wanted to show you my research, research beyond even what you can imagine! I wanted to prove, once and for all, that you are nothing compared to me! But that brat in the lab coat ruined everything! I know you were laughing at me too, don’t you deny it! How dare you treat your own father this way!?
Kurisu: I wasn’t--
Nakabachi: You want my opinion? Fine, I’ll give it to you. I’m going to publish it myself. End of discussion.
Kurisu: You’re... stealing it?
Nakabachi: ...What did you say?
Kurisu: You’re stealing my work? I didn’t think even you would do something like-- Ah!
Nakabachi: Who do you think you’re talking to!?
Kurisu: Ah, uuh...
