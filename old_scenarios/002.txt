 Rintaro and Kurisu are in a crowded lecture hall, where Kurisu is delivering a detailed presentation on time travel theories. She is explaining complex scientific concepts, including cosmic strings and Einstein's special theory of relativity, to an audience of academics, including Rintaro who is listening skeptically. As she continues her lecture, Kurisu will passionately defend her theories and challenge Rintaro's doubt about the feasibility of time travel.
