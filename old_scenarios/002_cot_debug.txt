Plan: This conversation takes place during a lecture on time travel theories, with Kurisu presenting her knowledge on the subject. This is likely at the beginning of the Steins;Gate story, when Rintaro and Kurisu first meet at the lecture and have a brief argument about the possibility of time travel. 

Scenario: Rintaro and Kurisu are in a crowded lecture hall, where Kurisu is delivering a detailed presentation on time travel theories. She is explaining complex scientific concepts, including cosmic strings and Einstein's special theory of relativity, to an audience of academics, including Rintaro who is listening skeptically. As she continues her lecture, Kurisu will passionately defend her theories and challenge Rintaro's doubt about the feasibility of time travel.
