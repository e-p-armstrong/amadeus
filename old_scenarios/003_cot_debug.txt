Plan: This conversation is happening during a lecture on time travel where Kurisu is explaining the scientific possibilities and limitations of time travel to Rintaro and others. This is likely in the early part of the series, before Kurisu joins the Future Gadget Laboratory and before the discovery of the Phone Microwave's time-traveling capabilities.

Scenario: Kurisu Makise, a renowned young scientist, is giving a public lecture on the theoretical possibilities of time travel in a university setting. Rintaro Okabe, an eccentric self-proclaimed 'mad scientist', is in the audience, listening skeptically to her explanations. Following her lecture, Kurisu will engage in a detailed discussion with Rintaro and others about the limitations and paradoxes of time travel, demonstrating her deep understanding of the subject.
