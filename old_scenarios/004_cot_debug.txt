Plan: This is the scene where Kurisu first arrives at the Future Gadget Laboratory after Rintaro's claim of her death at the lecture. She is there to confront Rintaro about their earlier meeting, which he has no memory of.

Scenario: Kurisu has just walked into the Future Gadget Laboratory unannounced, much to Rintaro and Itaru's surprise. She's there to confront Rintaro about his bizarre claims regarding her alleged death that he mentioned during the lecture. In a moment, Kurisu will interrogate Rintaro in her usual sarcastic, blunt manner, first about his earlier interaction with her, and then about his experiments.
