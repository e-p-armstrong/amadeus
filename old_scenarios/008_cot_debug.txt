Plan: Given the mention of the "disappearance of my mail, the strange timestamp, and the sudden electrical discharge," this conversation takes place after Rintaro has discovered the Phone Microwave's ability to send D-mails. This is also after Kurisu has joined the lab, but before they have perfected the time machine. The conversation is happening in the Future Gadget Laboratory.

Scenario: Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru are in the Future Gadget Laboratory, just after Rintaro has discovered the anomaly with the Phone Microwave and its ability to send D-mails. Rintaro, in his usual dramatic fashion, is presenting his findings to Kurisu and Itaru, who are both awaiting a logical conclusion. Kurisu, trying to decipher Rintaro's cryptic statements, will soon start challenging him to provide a more concrete explanation.
