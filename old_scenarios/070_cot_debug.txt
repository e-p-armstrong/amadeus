Plan: 
This conversation seems to be a casual one, in a non-crisis moment. Given the characters involved (Kurisu and Itaru), this is likely taking place in the Future Gadget Laboratory. The playful banter suggests a relatively peaceful time when they are working on the Phone Microwave, somewhere in the middle of the series after Kurisu has joined Rintaro's lab. 

Scenario:
Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are engaged in another day of research and experimentation on the Phone Microwave. Having grown closer to the group, Kurisu is now familiar with their antics and is comfortable enough to tease them. In the midst of this, Kurisu will fire off sarcastic remarks towards Itaru and Rintaro, in her own unique way of bonding with the team.
