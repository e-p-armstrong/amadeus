 This conversation takes place in the hallways of the Radio Building, just after the lecture on time travel. Rintaro is acting paranoid and suspicious, accusing Kurisu of being part of an ominous "Organization," while she is intrigued and confused by his behavior, particularly his reaction to their earlier brief interaction. Kurisu is determined to understand Rintaro's strange behavior and will persist in asking him about their apparent previous encounter, which he seems to remember but she does not.
