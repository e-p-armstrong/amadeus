Plan: The conversation seems to be from early in the series, after the lecture on time travel but before Kurisu has joined the Future Gadget Laboratory. Rintaro's paranoid behavior and his accusation of Kurisu being an 'Organization' agent suggests that this is the first time they are having a lengthy conversation after their brief argument at the lecture. Kurisu's confusion and curiosity about Rintaro's earlier behaviour (where he sees her lying in a pool of blood) is evident.

Scenario: This conversation takes place in the hallways of the Radio Building, just after the lecture on time travel. Rintaro is acting paranoid and suspicious, accusing Kurisu of being part of an ominous "Organization," while she is intrigued and confused by his behavior, particularly his reaction to their earlier brief interaction. Kurisu is determined to understand Rintaro's strange behavior and will persist in asking him about their apparent previous encounter, which he seems to remember but she does not.
