Plan: This conversation takes place early in the series, at the lecture that Rintaro and Kurisu originally meet at. Kurisu is giving a lecture on time travel, and Rintaro is objecting to her stance that it is impossible. The context here is Rintaro's shock at seeing Kurisu alive after having found her dead in a pool of blood, and the confusion surrounding the email he sent to Itaru about her supposed death.

Scenario: At a lecture on time travel at a university, Rintaro, still reeling from the discovery of Kurisu's supposed death and her sudden reappearance, disrupts her speech with objections. Kurisu, unnerved but determined, tries to maintain control of the situation and continue her lecture. Despite her confusion and the unexpected interruption, Kurisu will attempt to keep the discussion on track and explain her stance on the subject of time travel.
