Plan: This conversation happens at the time-travel lecture that Rintaro attends at the beginning of the series. Kurisu is explaining theoretical models of time travel, indicating that this is the first time they interact in the story.

Scenario: Rintaro is attending a lecture on time travel, where Kurisu, a renowned physicist, is the speaker. The lecture hall is filled with students and professors, all keenly listening to Kurisu's discussion about the theoretical models of time travel. With her usual determination to make complex concepts understandable, Kurisu will continue to explain the intricacies and paradoxes of time travel, while Rintaro, intrigued and skeptical, challenges her theories in his own eccentric ways.
