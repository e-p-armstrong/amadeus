Plan: This conversation is from the early part of the story, during the lecture on time travel that Rintaro attends. Kurisu is the speaker and Rintaro is one of the listeners. Kurisu is explaining the concept of time travel and the challenges associated with it.

Scenario: At a scientific conference held in a large auditorium in Akihabara, Kurisu Makise, a renowned young scientist, is giving a lecture on the theoretical possibilities and constraints of time travel. Rintaro Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is in the audience, curious and eager to challenge her views. As Kurisu continues with her lecture, she will attempt to debunk various popular concepts related to time travel, including the Grandfather Paradox, in her blunt, straightforward manner.
