Plan: Given that Kurisu is asking about the banana and the "microwave thing," this is likely the scene where Kurisu is first introduced to the Future Gadget Laboratory and the PhoneWave. Rintaro's insistence on her becoming a "lab mem" suggests this is their initial interaction in the lab after the time travel lecture, and before she officially joins the team. 

Scenario: In the cluttered confines of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu finds herself amidst Rintaro and Itaru, trying to understand the strange phenomena she has witnessed. She is feeling curious, if a bit annoyed by their eccentric behavior and pervy jokes. Although reluctant at first, Kurisu will soon engage in a discussion about the PhoneWave, paving the way for her eventual decision to join the lab as a member.
