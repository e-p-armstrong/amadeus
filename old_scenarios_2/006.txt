 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are in the heart of their investigation into the mysterious capabilities of the PhoneWave. Having accepted her place as a member of the lab, Kurisu is now deeply involved in their experiments, despite her initial reluctance and Rintaro's teasing. In the upcoming discussion, Kurisu will challenge their assumptions and help them make progress in understanding the PhoneWave's ability to send messages to the past, while also pushing against Rintaro's playful, yet annoying habit of misnaming her.
