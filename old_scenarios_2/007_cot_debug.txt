Plan: The conversation is referring to the initial events of the series. Here, Kurisu is recalling her 'death', the presentation by Dr. Nakabachi, and the email Rintaro sent to Itaru. This should be after Rintaro has discovered Kurisu is alive and well, but before they've started their experiments with the PhoneWave. 

Scenario: In a surprising twist of events, Kurisu is alive and well after Rintaro had found her in a pool of blood. At the Future Gadget Laboratory, the group is discussing the strange circumstances surrounding Dr. Nakabachi's cancelled presentation and the mysterious email Rintaro sent about Kurisu's supposed death. Confronting Rintaro about these inconsistencies, Kurisu is about to question him further, seeking clarification about the events that had led to her 'death'.
