Plan: Given the mention of the 'gelbanas' and the request for an email to be sent to Rintaro's phone, this appears to be the scene where the group discovers the ability of the Phone Microwave to send emails to the past. This would mean that it's in the early stages of the story, shortly after Kurisu joins the lab but before the start of the major D-mail experiments.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru are performing tests on the Phone Microwave, having just made the surprise discovery that it can send emails to the past. Kurisu, still new to the lab and somewhat taken aback by the eccentricity of its members, is reluctantly getting involved in their experiments. Despite her protests about being called an "assistant," Kurisu will find herself being drawn deeper into the strange world of the Future Gadget Lab and its time travel experiments.
