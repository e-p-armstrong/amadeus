Plan: Given the shock and disbelief in the group, it seems that this is the moment they first discover the PhoneWave's ability to send text messages and objects to the past. This scene takes place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, shortly after Kurisu has joined the lab group.

Scenario: In the cluttered, cozy confines of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru have just experienced an unexpected event with the PhoneWave, causing a chicken to burn and a hole in the floor. Amidst the confusion and shock, Kurisu is trying to rationalize the incident, not yet aware of the time-travel implications. In the coming conversation, Kurisu will challenge Rintaro's bold claim that they've inadvertently created a time machine, struggling to reconcile this with her scientific understanding.
