 Kurisu, after joining the Future Gadget Laboratory, visits Rintaro and the rest of the team to check on their progress with the PhoneWave. The setting is relaxed, with a touch of camaraderie and humor, as they engage in their usual banter about Rintaro's eccentricities and the lab's mysterious activities. Kurisu, curious yet slightly exasperated, will question Rintaro about the PhoneWave's progress and tease him about his conspiracy theories.
