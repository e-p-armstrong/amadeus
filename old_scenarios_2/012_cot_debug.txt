Plan: The conversation is between Rintaro and Kurisu, with Rintaro questioning Kurisu's denial of the PhoneWave's time-leaping capabilities. They're in the Future Gadget Laboratory, after successfully sending a D-mail, and the conversation revolves around Kurisu's skepticism in spite of the evidence. The conversation suggests that this takes place after a few successful experiments with D-mails and before the development of the Time Leap Machine. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are discussing the implications of their recent successful PhoneWave experiments, which have confirmed its ability to send messages to the past. Despite witnessing the process herself, Kurisu is in denial, struggling to reconcile her scientific training with the seemingly impossible phenomena happening before her. Throughout the conversation, she will continue to express her skepticism and question the validity of their findings, while Rintaro will persistently challenge her denial.
