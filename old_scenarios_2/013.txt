 Following the revelation of Kurisu's survival, Rintaro is in the Future Gadget Laboratory, engaging in a heated discussion with Kurisu about the potential of the PhoneWave (name subject to change) as a time machine. Kurisu, while intrigued by the paradox of her own death, remains skeptical, haunted by the memory of her father's downfall due to his obsession with time travel. Despite her reluctance, Kurisu will press Rintaro for an explanation about his hallucination of her death, opening the door to deeper involvement with Rintaro's experiments.
