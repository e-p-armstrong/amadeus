 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro have had a phone conversation about Rintaro's whereabouts, which led Kurisu to meet him at Yanabayashi Shrine where he's looking for the IBN 5100. Kurisu is feeling a mix of curiosity and annoyance; curiosity about the connection between the IBN 5100 and SERN, and annoyance towards Rintaro's constant misnaming of her and his dramatic antics. Despite her denial, Kurisu will persist in her quest to understand the connection between the IBN 5100 and SERN's time machine research.
