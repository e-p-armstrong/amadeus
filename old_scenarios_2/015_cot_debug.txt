Plan: This conversation takes place after Kurisu has joined the Future Gadget Laboratory but before they discover the full extent of SERN's involvement. Kurisu is showing interest in the IBN 5100 and SERN, which indicates she's getting more involved in the lab's activities. The conversation occurs over the phone initially, then transitions to Yanabayashi Shrine, where Rintaro is searching for the IBN 5100.

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro have had a phone conversation about Rintaro's whereabouts, which led Kurisu to meet him at Yanabayashi Shrine where he's looking for the IBN 5100. Kurisu is feeling a mix of curiosity and annoyance; curiosity about the connection between the IBN 5100 and SERN, and annoyance towards Rintaro's constant misnaming of her and his dramatic antics. Despite her denial, Kurisu will persist in her quest to understand the connection between the IBN 5100 and SERN's time machine research.
