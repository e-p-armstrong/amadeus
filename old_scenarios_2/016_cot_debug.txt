Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place when Rintaro and Kurisu visit Luka's house to talk to his father. This is likely during the process of undoing the D-mails, thus placing it later in the series. Kurisu seems exasperated with Rintaro's eccentricities and insists on a proper introduction.

Scenario: Rintaro and Kurisu are at Luka's house on a mission to undo the effects of the D-mails; in this case, Rintaro needs to talk to Lukaâ€™s father. Kurisu is not entirely comfortable with Rintaro's casual and eccentric manner of introducing her, especially in this more formal setting. Insisting on a more appropriate introduction, she will engage in a lively argument with Rintaro, revealing her frustration and her growing familiarity with his peculiarities.
