 As another day of tinkering with the PhoneWave (name subject to change) winds down in the Future Gadget Laboratory, Mayuri, in her usual cheerful manner, prepares to leave. Kurisu, feeling grateful for Mayuri's help but also focused on the task at hand, decides to stay behind to continue work on the time machine. Kurisu will remain at the lab, poring over their experimental data, trying to piece together the puzzle of time travel.
