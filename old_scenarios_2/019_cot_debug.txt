Plan: This conversation seems to be a casual one, set after a day's experiment, again within the Future Gadget Laboratory. It seems that Mayuri has provided some useful information to Rintaro (likely about some component for the PhoneWave), and she's now heading home. Kurisu, however, decides to stay at the lab, possibly to further work on the PhoneWave.

Scenario: As another day of tinkering with the PhoneWave (name subject to change) winds down in the Future Gadget Laboratory, Mayuri, in her usual cheerful manner, prepares to leave. Kurisu, feeling grateful for Mayuri's help but also focused on the task at hand, decides to stay behind to continue work on the time machine. Kurisu will remain at the lab, poring over their experimental data, trying to piece together the puzzle of time travel.
