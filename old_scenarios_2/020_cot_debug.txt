Plan: This conversation seems to take place after Kurisu has joined the lab but before they have developed a close relationship. The dialogue suggests that Kurisu is frustrated with Rintaro's behavior, possibly indicating that they are in the early stages of their collaboration on the Phone Microwave.

Scenario: In the cluttered confines of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu has been waiting for Rintaro who, in his typical fashion, has failed to answer his phone. Their relationship is still in its early stages; Kurisu is visibly irritated with Rintaro's lack of professional courtesy and his casual manner of addressing her. In the ensuing conversation, Kurisu will express her annoyance at Rintaro's nonchalance and demand an explanation for his tardiness.
