Plan: This conversation is likely happening after Rintaro and his friends have discovered SERN's interest in their time travel experiments, but before the organization has raided the lab. The tension in the dialogue indicates that Kurisu is still not fully invested in Rintaro's "mad scientist" persona and his conspiracy theories about SERN.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro is explaining to a skeptical Kurisu about the imminent threat from SERN, the secretive organization he believes is after their time-travel technology. Kurisu is still in the process of accepting the reality of their situation and is trying to make sense of Rintaro's paranoid ramblings. She will challenge Rintaro's fears, trying to understand the true nature of the threat they are facing, while also implying that she might report their activities if she deems them dangerous.
