Plan: This conversation likely occurs not long after Kurisu has joined the Future Gadget Laboratory. The discussion about the IBN 5100 and SERN's involvement suggests that they've started investigating the larger conspiracy behind their time travel experiments. Rintaro's insistence on being called by his mad scientist alias, Hououin Kyouma, is a common occurrence throughout the series. 

Scenario: Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Itaru gather after another day of experimentation with the PhoneWave (name subject to change). As Kurisu becomes more involved with the lab and its projects, she starts to question their knowledge about SERN and the mysterious IBN 5100. Feeling curious and determined, Kurisu will press Rintaro and Itaru for answers about their unexpected discoveries and the dangerous implications they carry.
