 In the bustling Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu is now part of Rintaro's group and is just beginning to delve into their secretive research on time travel, involving the PhoneWave and an enigmatic device called the IBN 5100. Still skeptical about their claims regarding SERN's clandestine activities, she demands proof and is determined to wait overnight if necessary, showing her growing commitment to the group's cause. As the conversation continues, Kurisu will be introduced to Rintaro's collection of Future Gadgets, and in a playful turn of events, she will be offered a lab coat, symbolizing her full acceptance into the lab's ranks.
