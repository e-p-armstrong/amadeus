Plan: This conversation seems to be happening soon after Kurisu joins Rintaro's lab and learns about their secret time-travel research. The fact that they're discussing SERN's involvement and the IBN 5100 indicates that this is before they get too deep into the time travel experiments, but after Kurisu has started to trust and work with them. This also seems to be the moment when Kurisu gets her lab coat, which happens when she fully joins the lab.

Scenario: In the bustling Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu is now part of Rintaro's group and is just beginning to delve into their secretive research on time travel, involving the PhoneWave and an enigmatic device called the IBN 5100. Still skeptical about their claims regarding SERN's clandestine activities, she demands proof and is determined to wait overnight if necessary, showing her growing commitment to the group's cause. As the conversation continues, Kurisu will be introduced to Rintaro's collection of Future Gadgets, and in a playful turn of events, she will be offered a lab coat, symbolizing her full acceptance into the lab's ranks.
