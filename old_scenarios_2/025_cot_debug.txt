Plan: This conversation takes place after the discovery of the time-travel capabilities of the Phone Microwave and Kurisu's arrival at the Future Gadget Laboratory. The detailed discussion about the experiment and the changes in the microwave's settings suggests that they are in the process of conducting further experiments and trying to understand the nature of the phenomenon. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are engaged in a deep discussion about the Phone Microwave's mysterious capabilities, after having discovered its ability to send messages to the past. They're trying to replicate the discharge phenomenon observed earlier, but their experiment results are inconsistent. Frustrated yet still determined, Kurisu is gearing up to dissect the issue further, questioning every variable and refusing to jump to conclusions.
