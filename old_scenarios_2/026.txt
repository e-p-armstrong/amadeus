 During a break from their experiments at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu engage in a casual conversation over food choices, revealing Kurisu's American influences and her current living situation in Tokyo.

In the upcoming conversation, Kurisu, feeling hurt and defensive, will attempt to shut down Rintaro's intrusive questions about her family issues.
