Plan: This conversation happens after the group has discovered that the Phone Microwave can send messages to the past. They are digging into SERN's files to find out more about their own time travel experiments, with Kurisu translating some documents from English.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are examining the confidential files they hacked from SERN, revealing the organization's secret time travel experiments. Kurisu, despite her initial skepticism, is gradually accepting the reality of time travel, and is deeply invested in understanding SERN's involvement. As they continue analyzing the documents, Kurisu will translate and share the shocking revelations they uncover about SERN's "Z Program" and its hidden purpose: control over time and space.
