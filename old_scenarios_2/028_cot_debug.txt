Plan: This conversation is happening after Kurisu has joined the Future Gadget Laboratory team and they have started to realize the implications of their time travel experiments. It appears they are discussing the Z Program, which is related to SERN's time travel experiments. The mood is serious and Kurisu seems to be reading from a document, likely explaining the program's stages to the team.

Scenario: Within the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are delving into the secrets of SERN's Z Program after realizing the potential dangers of their own time travel experiments. Kurisu, feeling both anxious and determined, is methodically explaining the stages of the Z Program, revealing the potential for human experimentation. Despite the tension, she will continue to shed light on SERN's plans, hoping to understand more about the consequences they might face if they continue their own experiments.
