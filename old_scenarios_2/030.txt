 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are deep into a discussion about the science behind time travel, particularly SERN's research and John Titor's predictions. Having stumbled upon SERN's secret research, they are in the process of piecing together the implications. Kurisu, intrigued and somewhat incredulous, will continue to analyze and explain the complex theories to her companions despite the occasional distraction.
