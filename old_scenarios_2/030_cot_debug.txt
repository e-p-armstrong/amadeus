Plan: This conversation revolves around the trio discussing the technicalities of time travel and SERN's research. Given the depth of the conversation and the mention of John Titor, it's likely that this is taking place after they've discovered the functionality of the PhoneWave and have begun to dig deeper into the concept of time travel. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are deep into a discussion about the science behind time travel, particularly SERN's research and John Titor's predictions. Having stumbled upon SERN's secret research, they are in the process of piecing together the implications. Kurisu, intrigued and somewhat incredulous, will continue to analyze and explain the complex theories to her companions despite the occasional distraction.
