 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru are engrossed in a series of discussions about the complex concept of time travel using Kerr black holes, building upon their understanding of the Phone Microwave's capability. Kurisu, as the resident expert, is trying to demystify the concept of event horizons, naked singularities, and their implications for time travel. In the upcoming discussion, she will continue to elaborate on these intricate theories and how SERN might be using them in their time travel experiments.
