Plan: In this conversation, Kurisu is explaining the theory of Kerr black holes, their potential for time travel, and the difficulty of manipulating a micro singularity's gravitational field. This is an advanced scientific discussion, likely taking place after the discovery of the Phone Microwave's time-traveling capability and the characters' deep dive into the mechanics of time travel, but before the SERN raid.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru are engrossed in a series of discussions about the complex concept of time travel using Kerr black holes, building upon their understanding of the Phone Microwave's capability. Kurisu, as the resident expert, is trying to demystify the concept of event horizons, naked singularities, and their implications for time travel. In the upcoming discussion, she will continue to elaborate on these intricate theories and how SERN might be using them in their time travel experiments.
