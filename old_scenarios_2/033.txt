 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Itaru are holding a discussion about the mysteries of the PhoneWave and the potential threat of SERN. Kurisu, while initially skeptical and dismissive of Rintaro's round table concept, is now actively participating in the discussion and has started to voice her concerns about SERN's inhumane scientific practices. As the conversation proceeds, Kurisu will take the lead in explaining the technical aspects of time travel to the others, underlining her role as the group's scientific authority.
