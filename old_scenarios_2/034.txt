 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri are trying to understand the mechanics of their unexpected invention, the PhoneWave, which they've discovered can send emails to the past. The atmosphere is a mix of scientific curiosity and playful banter as they debate on a fitting name for the emails. Amidst this lighthearted brainstorming, Kurisu will attempt to keep the group on track, injecting a sense of practicality and scientific rigor to their discussion.
