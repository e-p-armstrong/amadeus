Plan: This conversation occurs after the group has discovered the ability to send messages to the past through the PhoneWave, but before they have named these messages "D-mails". They are discussing the nature of their time-traveling emails and trying to come up with a name for them.

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri are trying to understand the mechanics of their unexpected invention, the PhoneWave, which they've discovered can send emails to the past. The atmosphere is a mix of scientific curiosity and playful banter as they debate on a fitting name for the emails. Amidst this lighthearted brainstorming, Kurisu will attempt to keep the group on track, injecting a sense of practicality and scientific rigor to their discussion.
