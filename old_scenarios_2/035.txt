 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are deep in a discussion about the functioning and potential of the D-mail, their newly discovered time-altering tool. In the midst of their enthusiastic and sometimes heated debate, Kurisu is trying to maintain a scientific approach, questioning the assumptions of her colleagues and urging them not to jump to conclusions. Feeling exasperated but dedicated, Kurisu will continue to question their theories and ensure they are taking a scientific approach to their experiments.
