Plan: This conversation seems to take place after the discovery of the D-mail and its potential but before they fully understand how to control it. Kurisu is trying to be the voice of reason and caution, questioning the assumptions made by Rintaro and Itaru, and the conversation ends with a clumsy accident involving the microwave, indicating that it likely takes place in the lab.

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are deep in a discussion about the functioning and potential of the D-mail, their newly discovered time-altering tool. In the midst of their enthusiastic and sometimes heated debate, Kurisu is trying to maintain a scientific approach, questioning the assumptions of her colleagues and urging them not to jump to conclusions. Feeling exasperated but dedicated, Kurisu will continue to question their theories and ensure they are taking a scientific approach to their experiments.
