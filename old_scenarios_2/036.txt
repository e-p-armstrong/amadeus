 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, the disparate group of friends, led by Kurisu, is engrossed in their ongoing experiments with D-Mails using the PhoneWave. Having grown accustomed to Rintaro's over-the-top antics and Mayuri's innocent curiosity, Kurisu, despite being frustrated with the lack of serious commitment, is determined to understand the peculiarities of the D-mails. Even as Rintaro banters and Mayuri fusses, Kurisu will keep the focus on the experiment, trying to uncover the mysteries of the D-mails and their inconsistent delivery patterns.
