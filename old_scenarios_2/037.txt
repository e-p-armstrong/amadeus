 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, following a series of successful D-Mail experiments, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru have gathered to review their findings and plan their next steps. Despite the exhaustion from staying up all night for the experiments, Kurisu maintains her focus and is determined to understand the underlying principles of their newfound time-travel capabilities. Going forward, Kurisu will continue to push for thorough scrutiny and testing of their observations to ensure they fully understand the implications and limitations of D-Mail.
