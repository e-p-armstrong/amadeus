Plan: This conversation shows the team discussing the technical details and hurdles of their time travel experiments. The presence of Mayuri and the light-hearted teasing between the team members suggest this conversation is taking place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, post Kurisu's initial skepticism, and during the period when they are experimenting with the PhoneWave. 

Scenario: In the casual, yet intellectual, environment of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri are deeply engrossed in a discussion about the limitations of their time travel experiment, namely the PhoneWave. Kurisu, having warmed up to the group, is actively engaging with them, providing scientific insights and also participating in the light-hearted banter. As the conversation progresses, Kurisu will attempt to explain the complex theories behind their experiments, even as she good-naturedly threatens to use Rintaro and Itaru as test subjects for their time travel experiments.
