Plan: This conversation is focused on the technical issues and mysteries surrounding the PhoneWave, which suggests that it's a part of the story where the characters are actively experimenting with and trying to understand it. This is likely after the group has discovered the PhoneWave's ability to send D-mails but before they've fully mastered its use or discovered its dangers. 

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro and the team are in the thick of their research into the mysterious properties of the PhoneWave, which they've recently discovered can send emails to the past. They're fascinated and excited but also plagued by numerous unanswered questions about the machine's constraints and capabilities. In this scene, Kurisu is feeling frustrated by the unresolved issues and decides that they need to dig deeper into the PhoneWave's mechanics, planning to push for a more systematic investigation.
