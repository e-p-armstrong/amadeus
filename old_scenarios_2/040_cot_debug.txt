Plan: This conversation happens after the characters have discovered the function of the PhoneWave as a time machine, but before the intense time leaps and SERN's intervention. This is a period where they are still trying to understand the implications of their accidental invention and are debating its legitimacy. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Itaru are in the midst of a heated debate about the legitimacy of the PhoneWave's time travel capabilities, following their startling discovery. Kurisu, skeptical and rooted in scientific facts, is struggling to reconcile with the accidental nature of their invention and the concept of time travel itself. As the conversation unfolds, Kurisu will persist in challenging Rintaro's assertions, attempting to ground their findings in more tangible, scientifically proven principles.
