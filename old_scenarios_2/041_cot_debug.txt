Plan: This conversation is taking place at the Future Gadget Laboratory, where the team is preparing to continue their experiments with the PhoneWave, which causes the building to shake when in use. Rintaro's dialogue about a promise with Mr. Braun implies that they've already had some problems with the shaking, which would place this scene after the initial discovery that the PhoneWave can send messages to the past.

Scenario: Within the cluttered confines of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Mayuri are discussing the continuation of their PhoneWave experiments, which have previously caused disturbances due to the machine's shaking. Kurisu, now a part of the team and invested in their research, expresses her concern about the impact of the experiments on the building. In a bid to assure their safety and progress, Kurisu will attempt to counter Rintaro's reckless confidence with her own logical reasoning.
