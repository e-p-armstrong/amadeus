Plan: This conversation takes place at a stage when the core group is together and already familiar with each other, which suggests it's after Kurisu's induction into the lab, and before the SERN crisis. They are discussing a new version of the PhoneWave, indicating that the scene is during their period of intense experimentation with time travel. Kurisu's exasperation in this conversation indicates her growing frustration with the lab members' eccentricities. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Itaru, Mayuri, and newly arrived Moeka are collaborating on the development of a new version of the PhoneWave, while simultaneously engaging in their usual hijinks. Kurisu, despite participating in the conversation, is growing increasingly frustrated with the team's lack of focus and their propensity for nonsensical banter. In the upcoming moments, the ever-pragmatic Kurisu will attempt to steer the team's attention back to the task at hand, despite the distractions.
