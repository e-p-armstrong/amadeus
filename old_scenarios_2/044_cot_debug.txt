Plan: This conversation occurs after Kurisu has joined the lab and the team has started experimenting with D-mails. Rintaro's dismissive attitude towards the details and Kurisu's insistence on accuracy suggests they are in the midst of their experiments. The mention of "yesterday was the 66th" could likely refer to their 66th experiment or day of experimentation.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Kurisu, and the rest of the lab members have been conducting experiments with D-mails for several days, and they are on their 66th day or experiment. Kurisu, ever the meticulous scientist, is questioning the discrepancy in the count, while Rintaro dismisses her concerns in his usual abrasive manner. In the midst of this heated discussion, Kurisu will continue to challenge Rintaro's oversight and assert her identity, showing her determination to be recognized for her scientific rigour and not just as an assistant.
