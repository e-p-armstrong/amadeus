Plan: This conversation is centered around the team's experiments with the PhoneWave and their plans to test its ability to change the past. Rintaro's suggestion of using it to win the lottery and Kurisu's reluctance to agree indicates this is early in their experimentation, after the realization of PhoneWave's potential but before the gravity of their actions has truly set in.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, the group is discussing the potential applications of their accidental time machine, the PhoneWave, with Rintaro suggesting they test it by winning the lottery. Kurisu, skeptical and cautious, is questioning the morality and true intentions behind Rintaro's plan. In the ensuing conversation, Kurisu will remain critical, challenging Rintaro's motivations and trying to steer the group towards a more ethical use of their newfound power.
