 In the Future Gadget Lab, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Mayuri have been experimenting with sending 'D-Mails' - text messages into the past - using the PhoneWave. They've discovered that these D-mails have the power to change the present, as evidenced by Rintaro's excitement over a lottery win he's manipulated with a D-mail. In this moment, Kurisu, confused and mildly irritated, is trying to understand what Rintaro is babbling about.
