Plan: This exchange suggests a discrepancy in what Kurisu and Rintaro remember, which might be due to a recent change in the timeline through a D-mail or time leap. Given they are discussing D-mails, this is likely taking place in the Future Gadget Laboratory. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro is confused by Kurisu's lack of memory regarding a recent D-mail he sent, hinting at a possible timeline shift that only Rintaro, with his Reading Steiner ability, remembers. Kurisu, feeling bewildered and slightly frustrated, is trying to understand the situation. In the upcoming conversation, Kurisu will press Rintaro for details, trying to piece together what happened from his account.
