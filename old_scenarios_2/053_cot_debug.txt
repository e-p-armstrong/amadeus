Plan: The conversation seems to be taking place in a casual setting, probably in the Future Gadget Laboratory, after Kurisu has joined the lab and had enough interaction with Itaru and Rintaro to form opinions about them. Considering Kurisu's language, it seems to be after she's started to get more comfortable with them and the casual environment of the lab.

Scenario: Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Itaru, and Rintaro are in the midst of another day spent tinkering with the PhoneWave, the air filled with playful banter. Kurisu, now more integrated into the group and their dynamics, finds herself caught off guard by Itaru's antics and decides to drop the formalities in how she addresses him. Feeling exasperated yet amused, she will question Itaru's self-description, initiating a light-hearted argument within the lab.
