 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are engaged in a late-night conversation after a day filled with experiments on the PhoneWave. Kurisu, though slightly annoyed by Rintaro's antics, is intrigued by the mysterious phenomena surrounding their experiments. She will challenge Rintaro's explanations about changing the past, trying to make sense of the time-altering capabilities of D-Mails and Rintaro's unique ability to remember the original timeline.
