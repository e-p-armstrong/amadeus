Plan: This conversation is a serious one between Kurisu and Rintaro, where Rintaro seems to be explaining his Reading Steiner ability to Kurisu, thus suggesting that this scene takes place after the discovery of the Phone Microwave's time travel capabilities and Kurisu joining the Future Gadget Laboratory. This would also be before the SERN raid and Mayuri's consequent deaths, given the situation is still somewhat calm.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are engaged in a late-night conversation after a day filled with experiments on the PhoneWave. Kurisu, though slightly annoyed by Rintaro's antics, is intrigued by the mysterious phenomena surrounding their experiments. She will challenge Rintaro's explanations about changing the past, trying to make sense of the time-altering capabilities of D-Mails and Rintaro's unique ability to remember the original timeline.
