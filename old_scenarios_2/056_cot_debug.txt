Plan: This conversation occurs after the discovery of the D-Mail functionality of the Phone Microwave, but before the disastrous consequences of time manipulation are revealed. The setting is the Future Gadget Laboratory where Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are discussing their current project, Operation Urd. The conversation indicates a disagreement between Kurisu and Rintaro about the ethics of changing the past.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro is eager to proceed with Operation Urd, the series of experiments involving the sending of D-Mails to change the past, despite Kurisu's ethical reservations. The team is still in the phase of exploration and discovery, with the negative consequences of their actions yet to materialize. A conflicted Kurisu, struggling with the moral implications of their activities, will express her disapproval and attempt to distance herself from the experiment.
