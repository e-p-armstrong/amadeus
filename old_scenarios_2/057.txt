 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru are deeply engaged in a discussion about the mechanics of D-mails and the impact they have on the timeline, following multiple attempts to alter past events. Kurisu, with her scientific curiosity piqued, is persistently questioning Rintaro about his unique ability to retain memory across different timelines, dubbed "Reading Steiner". As the conversation progresses, Kurisu will challenge the team's understanding of D-mails and their effect on the timeline, pushing them to refine their theories.
