Plan: From the conversation, it is evident that they are in the lab and have been working on the PhoneWave. Rintaro, Itaru, and Kurisu are all present. There is a sense of frustration and confusion about how the device works, particularly from Kurisu, who has been thinking about the PhoneWave after leaving the lab the previous day. This places the scene after Kurisu has joined the lab, but before they have fully understood the mechanism behind the time travel capability of the PhoneWave.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Itaru, and Kurisu have just concluded another unsuccessful experiment with the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Despite the setback, Kurisu, intrigued and slightly frustrated, has been mulling over the device's inexplicable ability to send text messages back in time. With her skepticism peaking and her curiosity piqued, she will challenge Rintaro's explanation by raising her concerns, before leaving to reflect further on the device's mysterious mechanism.
