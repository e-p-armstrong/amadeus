Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place early in the day at the Future Gadget Laboratory, likely after Kurisu has joined the lab but early enough that she still feels rather detached from the group. The conversation about the part-timer suggests a casual, non-crisis moment, and Kurisu's indifference toward her lab membership number shows she doesn't yet fully appreciate the team's camaraderie.

Scenario: In the morning at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu has just encountered a part-timer downstairs who seems to harbor some resentment toward her. Kurisu, still somewhat distant and not fully committed to the team, converses with Rintaro and Itaru about the interaction. Despite Rintaro's dramatic response, Kurisu, maintaining her typical pragmatism, will dismiss his theatrics with her usual dry wit.
