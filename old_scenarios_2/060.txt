 The Future Gadget Laboratory team, including Kurisu, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Itaru, are in the middle of testing the PhoneWave's capabilities to send D-mails. Having just discovered the ability to send texts to the past, they are now trying to better understand the mechanics of the process, and Kurisu is leading the scientific exploration. As they continue their experiment, Kurisu will try to manage the group's chaotic brainstorming while attempting to glean meaningful data from their attempts.
