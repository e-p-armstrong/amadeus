Plan: This conversation suggests they are in the midst of experimenting with the Phone Microwave, specifically trying to figure out how long they need to run it to cause the "discharge" that allows them to send D-mails. This is likely shortly after they discover the Phone Microwave's time travel capability, but before they start sending D-mails to grant their friends' wishes. 

Scenario: The Future Gadget Laboratory team, including Kurisu, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Itaru, are in the middle of testing the PhoneWave's capabilities to send D-mails. Having just discovered the ability to send texts to the past, they are now trying to better understand the mechanics of the process, and Kurisu is leading the scientific exploration. As they continue their experiment, Kurisu will try to manage the group's chaotic brainstorming while attempting to glean meaningful data from their attempts.
