 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Itaru, and Kurisu have been experimenting with D-mails, sending messages into the past via the PhoneWave. After a D-mail is sent, Rintaro is the only one who remembers the original timeline due to his Reading Steiner ability, causing confusion among the group. Kurisu, having experienced this before, will try to make sense of the situation and probe Rintaro for more information about what he remembers.
