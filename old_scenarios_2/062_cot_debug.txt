Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place after the group has already discovered the Phone Microwave's ability to send D-mails and has begun experimenting with it. They are in the Future Gadget Laboratory and have just sent a D-mail, causing a shift in timelines that only Rintaro notices due to his Reading Steiner ability. Kurisu is trying to understand why they can't remember the same things Rintaro does.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Itaru, and Kurisu have been experimenting with D-mails, sending messages into the past via the PhoneWave. After a D-mail is sent, Rintaro is the only one who remembers the original timeline due to his Reading Steiner ability, causing confusion among the group. Kurisu, having experienced this before, will try to make sense of the situation and probe Rintaro for more information about what he remembers.
