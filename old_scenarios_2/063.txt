 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and the others are discussing the after-effects of their D-mail experiments, specifically the changes to the timeline and the paradoxes they create. Kurisu, with her scientific curiosity piqued, is feeling skeptical about Rintaro's 'Reading Steiner' and is about to probe further into his ability, questioning its validity. Despite her skepticism, Kurisu is also feeling a bit out of place, and will make an effort to fit in with the group by agreeing to Mayuri's suggestion of a sleepover, though with her own conditions.
