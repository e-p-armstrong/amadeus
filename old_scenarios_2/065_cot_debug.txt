Plan: This lively conversation reveals the group's dynamic and their unique personalities. The characters are casually sharing their wishes, and Luka expresses a desire to be a girl, which surprises Kurisu. This dialogue takes place in the lab, after Kurisu has joined and before the lab members start using D-mails to grant wishes. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, the lab members, including Kurisu, are engaging in a lighthearted discussion about their individual wishes, highlighting their camaraderie and the relative peace of this period in their lives. Kurisu is taken aback when Luka, who she had assumed was a girl due to his feminine appearance and demeanor, expresses a wish to be a girl. Unsettled by this revelation and Rintaro's teasing, Kurisu will try to recover her composure, while also making sure Itaru doesn't take advantage of the situation.
