 At the Future Gadget Lab, Rintaro and Kurisu are engaged in a light-hearted debate about gender determination theories and the potential application of their D-Mail technology. After their initial experimentation phase, the team is in a period of calm, exploring the possibilities of their invention without fully understanding the potential repercussions. Kurisu, despite her initial reluctance, will be dragged into Rintaro's wild idea and will reluctantly agree to further explore this use of D-Mail.
