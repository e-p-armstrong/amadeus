Plan: The conversation revolves around the use of the PhoneWave and D-Mail, indicating that Kurisu is already a part of the lab and familiar with their experiments. Given the light-hearted tone and the discussion about using D-mail for personal, non-critical reasons, this is likely a period of relative peace before the consequences of D-mails become apparent.

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Lab, Rintaro and Kurisu are engaged in a light-hearted debate about gender determination theories and the potential application of their D-Mail technology. After their initial experimentation phase, the team is in a period of calm, exploring the possibilities of their invention without fully understanding the potential repercussions. Kurisu, despite her initial reluctance, will be dragged into Rintaro's wild idea and will reluctantly agree to further explore this use of D-Mail.
