 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Mayuri, Luka, and Itaru are in the midst of a brainstorming session, trying to figure out how to send a D-mail to someone who might not have had a cellphone at the time it needs to be sent. Kurisu is actively engaging in the discussion, offering ideas and challenging others' suggestions, a clear indication of her acceptance of her role in the lab. With a blend of sarcasm and scientific reasoning, Kurisu will challenge Rintaro next, pushing him to come up with a solution to their conundrum.
