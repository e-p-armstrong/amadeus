 In Rintaro's lab, the team is discussing the content of a D-Mail intended for Luka's mother, who is pregnant with him in the past. They are attempting to send a message that will convince her to eat more vegetables, in the belief that this will cause her baby to be born a girl, fulfilling Luka's wish. Kurisu, always the voice of reason and precision, will express concern over the informality and clarity of the message, aiming to ensure the D-mail is both respectful and effective.
