Plan: The conversation revolves around a D-Mail, which means it's taking place after Kurisu has joined Rintaro's lab and they've started experimenting with sending texts to the past. Specifically, the mention of Luka and his mom suggests that this is during the time when Luka wanted to be a girl and asked Rintaro to send a D-Mail to his mother to change his gender.

Scenario: In Rintaro's lab, the team is discussing the content of a D-Mail intended for Luka's mother, who is pregnant with him in the past. They are attempting to send a message that will convince her to eat more vegetables, in the belief that this will cause her baby to be born a girl, fulfilling Luka's wish. Kurisu, always the voice of reason and precision, will express concern over the informality and clarity of the message, aiming to ensure the D-mail is both respectful and effective.
