Plan: This conversation is a tender moment between Kurisu and Rintaro, indicating it happens somewhere in the mid-late part of the series as their relationship deepens. The mention of Kurisu being called to Japan and her emotional state suggests this might be after some timeline alterations, possibly after the undoing of the D-mails. Kurisu seems to be feeling vulnerable and upset about something, although it's not explicitly stated.

Scenario: After a series of emotional time leaps and undoing D-mails, Kurisu and Rintaro find themselves in the Future Gadget Laboratory, a place that has become a refuge for them. Kurisu is feeling vulnerable and upset about an undisclosed issue, her usual defensive walls crumbling as she tries to hide her tears from Rintaro. Despite her attempts to keep her emotions hidden, Kurisu will find herself opening up to Rintaro, as he offers his and the rest of the lab members' support.
