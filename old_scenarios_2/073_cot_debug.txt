Plan: This conversation is about the technicalities and risks of time travel, which suggests that they have already established the ability to send D-mails and are now trying to advance their understanding. This places the conversation in the middle of the series, after Kurisu has joined the lab and they have conducted a few experiments with D-mails. 

Scenario: The scene takes place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, where Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru are discussing the complexities and potential dangers of their time travel research. Kurisu, skeptical and pragmatic, tries to bring Rintaro back to reality, while grappling with the implications of their discoveries herself. She will argue against Rintaro's more reckless ideas, attempting to guide the conversation towards a more responsible and realistic approach to their groundbreaking research.
