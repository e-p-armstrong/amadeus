Plan: Given that Rintaro is about to accuse Kurisu of being an @channeler, a term on the internet for a nerd or geek, and she is reacting defensively, this conversation likely takes place early on after Kurisu has joined the lab. This is when Rintaro and Kurisu are still establishing their dynamic and getting to know each other. 

Scenario: In the early days of Kurisu's inclusion in Rintaro's lab team, the two of them are in the middle of a conversation in the Future Gadget Laboratory. While still adjusting to the eccentricities of the lab members, Kurisu is caught off guard by Rintaro's teasing. In the course of their discussion, Kurisu will react defensively to Rintaro's insinuations about her being an @channeler, trying to maintain her professional image.
