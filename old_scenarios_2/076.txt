 After a series of experiments with the PhoneWave and D-Mails changing the past, the team finds themselves in a state of confusion when the IBN 5100, a critical computer for their research, seemingly vanishes from the lab, leaving only Rintaro with memories of its existence. Kurisu, even though skeptical about Rintaro's claim, is trying to understand the situation and figure out what might have happened. In the upcoming discussion, Kurisu will try to piece together the puzzle by questioning Rintaro about his last memory of the IBN 5100 and challenging him to recall the sequence of events accurately.
