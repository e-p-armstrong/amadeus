Plan: This conversation seems to be happening after the group has started experimenting with the D-mails and Faris has become involved. This is likely during a moment of uncertainty, where Rintaro is trying to make sense of the changes and is reaching out to Faris for some reason. 

Scenario: Back in the Future Gadget Laboratory, the team is in the middle of an intensive discussion about the effects of their D-mail experiments. Kurisu, trying to calm down an anxious Rintaro, proposes that the changes he's noticing might be psychological. Amid the tension, Kurisu will find herself perplexed by Mayuri's unique way of speaking to Faris, adding a touch of humor to the serious situation.
