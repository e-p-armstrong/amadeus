 In the midst of their time travel experiments at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro calls Kurisu, who is elsewhere in the building, to adjust the settings of the PhoneWave (name subject to change) for an important test. Despite her initial irritation at Rintaro's antics, Kurisu is fully invested in the project and is growing more accustomed to the eccentricities of her lab mates. She reluctantly agrees to Rintaro's request, preparing herself to deal with the potential fallout from their downstairs neighbor, Mr. Braun.
