Plan: This conversation takes place after Kurisu joins Rintaro's lab and they start working on the Phone Microwave together. The topic of the call indicates they are about to perform an experiment with the Phone Microwave, suggesting that they're in the middle of their extensive experiments journey. Kurisu's reluctance to upset the man downstairs (Mr. Braun) shows that she's becoming more involved in the lab's activities and is concerned about the potential consequences.

Scenario: In the midst of their time travel experiments at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro calls Kurisu, who is elsewhere in the building, to adjust the settings of the PhoneWave (name subject to change) for an important test. Despite her initial irritation at Rintaro's antics, Kurisu is fully invested in the project and is growing more accustomed to the eccentricities of her lab mates. She reluctantly agrees to Rintaro's request, preparing herself to deal with the potential fallout from their downstairs neighbor, Mr. Braun.
