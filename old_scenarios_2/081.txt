 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and the others are discussing the recent change in timeline caused by sending a D-Mail to alter Luka's gender. Kurisu is irritated by Rintaro's self-proclaimed 'Reading Steiner', his ability to perceive changes in the worldline, and his general lack of remorse for the consequences of their actions. Frustrated yet determined to make him realize the gravity of their actions, Kurisu will continue to dispute Rintaro's perspective, challenging his assertions with her typical blend of sarcasm and scientific logic.
