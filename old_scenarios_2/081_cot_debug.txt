Plan: This conversation is happening after the group has used a D-Mail to change Luka's gender in the past. It is likely taking place in the lab, due to the presence of multiple main characters and the discussion revolving around the D-Mails and Reading Steiner. Given the dialogue, Kurisu is frustrated at Rintaro's insistence on his "Observer" status and the use of the term Reading Steiner.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and the others are discussing the recent change in timeline caused by sending a D-Mail to alter Luka's gender. Kurisu is irritated by Rintaro's self-proclaimed 'Reading Steiner', his ability to perceive changes in the worldline, and his general lack of remorse for the consequences of their actions. Frustrated yet determined to make him realize the gravity of their actions, Kurisu will continue to dispute Rintaro's perspective, challenging his assertions with her typical blend of sarcasm and scientific logic.
