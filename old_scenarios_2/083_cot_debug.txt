Plan: This conversation seems to be happening at a point in the story where Rintaro and Kurisu have grown close enough to consider each other friends, but they're not yet at the point of confessing their feelings for each other. This would likely be after they've started working together on the PhoneWave and after they've sent various D-mails, but before the major crisis points in the story.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are taking a brief respite from their experiments with the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Going through many timeline alterations and shared experiences, they've fostered a camaraderie that is now blossoming into a deeper connection. In this moment, Kurisu finds herself opening up and admitting her fondness for Rintaro, albeit in her own tsundere way, setting the stage for further development of their relationship.
