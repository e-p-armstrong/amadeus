Plan: Given the mention of the PhoneWave and the friendly banter, this conversation seems to be taking place relatively early in the series, after Kurisu has joined the lab but before the discovery of D-mails. The discussion of a "time machine meet" and Mayuri's cooking suggests that they're in the lab, taking a break from their experiments.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and the others are taking a break from their experiments on the PhoneWave. As they discuss an upcoming science fiction event and help Mayuri with her cooking, the atmosphere is light and playful. In the midst of this casual interaction, Kurisu is still curious about the workings of the PhoneWave and will try to use it for ordinary cooking, despite the potential for disaster.
