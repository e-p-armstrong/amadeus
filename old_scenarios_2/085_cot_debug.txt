Plan: This conversation seems to occur after Rintaro's failed attempt to help Suzuha in finding her father, which positions it somewhere around the middle of the series. The D-Mail reference suggests the group is in the Future Gadget Laboratory and have already discovered the Phone Microwave's time-traveling abilities.   

Scenario: Having just returned to the Future Gadget Laboratory after a failed mission to help Suzuha find her father, Rintaro shares the disappointing news with the others, including Kurisu. Despite the setback, the atmosphere in the lab is charged with a strange sense of excitement, as Rintaro laughs manically, hinting at a possible solution. Amid the tension, Kurisu, though somewhat worried about Rintaro's state, is about to question his suggestion of using a D-Mail, showcasing her cautious nature towards the usage of their time-traveling technology.
