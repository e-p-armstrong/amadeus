Plan: This conversation seems to take place after Kurisu has joined the lab and they have been working on the PhoneWave for a while. Given the detailed discussion about how the PhoneWave works, it's likely after they discovered it can send D-mails but before they discovered the "Time Leap" method. The conversation is scientific and involves all main characters, indicating Kurisu's active involvement in the research and her growing closeness with the team.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Lab, the group has been experimenting with the PhoneWave's ability to send D-mails, and they are grappling with understanding exactly how it works. Kurisu, drawing upon her vast knowledge and insights, has come up with a hypothesis about the device's function which she is eager to share. In the upcoming conversation, Kurisu, feeling confident yet somewhat apprehensive, will explain her complex theory about the PhoneWave's operation, potentially changing the group's understanding of their own invention.
