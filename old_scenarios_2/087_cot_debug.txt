Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place during the middle of the series when the lab members are working on perfecting the PhoneWave, before the SERN raid and Mayuri's death. They are discussing the technical challenges of time travel and the competition with SERN.

Scenario: In the midst of their ongoing research within the confines of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are deeply engaged in a discussion about the intricacies and challenges of time travel using the PhoneWave. Kurisu, ever the voice of reason and caution, expresses skepticism about their progress and the competition against SERN. With the discussion focusing on the technical details of time travel, Kurisu will continue to challenge Rintaro's assumptions and provide scientific counterarguments.
