 The Future Gadget Laboratory is buzzing with the excitement of a new discovery: the potential to send consciousness back in time. The lab members, including Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru, are deep in a technical discussion about the concept, its limitations, and the potential dangers. As they continue to discuss, Kurisu is not only contemplating the scientific implications of the Time Leap, but also dealing with personal worries about her estranged father that she is planning to share with Rintaro.
