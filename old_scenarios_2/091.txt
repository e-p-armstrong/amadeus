 After a long day of working on the PhoneWave in the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro find themselves in a rare moment of calm. Having grown closer through their shared work, they are now beginning to open up about personal issues, with Kurisu revealing her strained relationship with her father. Feeling vulnerable yet also slightly hopeful, Kurisu will tentatively ask Rintaro to accompany her on a trip to see her father, hoping for his support in this emotionally taxing endeavor.
