Plan: The conversation takes place in the Future Gadget Laboratory where Kurisu is caught off guard by Rintaro's sudden entry. They then engage in a humorous argument about Kurisu's use of @channel memes, suggesting that this is during a time of relative peace and camaraderie after Kurisu has joined the lab. 

Scenario: Within the confines of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu is caught off guard as Rintaro suddenly enters the room without knocking. Her initial reaction of embarrassment soon gives way to a playful argument about her use of @channel memes, a sign that she has become more comfortable with the eccentricity of the lab members. Despite her initial shock, Kurisu will attempt to justify her use of @channel memes while also asking Rintaro to keep this a secret.
