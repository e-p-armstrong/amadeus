 It's another day at the Future Gadget Laboratory and Mayuri has suggested to her parents that Kurisu will be staying overnight to work on the PhoneWave. Kurisu, while initially surprised and reluctant due to Rintaro's presence, agrees to stay after some playful banter. Throughout the evening, Kurisu will continue to engage in friendly yet sarcastic exchanges with Rintaro, while also trying to establish boundaries for their overnight work session.
