Plan: This conversation takes place in the Future Gadget Laboratory when the team is working on the PhoneWave and is in a relatively peaceful time after Kurisu has joined Rintaro's lab. The conversation suggests that Mayuri has invited Kurisu to spend the night at the lab to work on the PhoneWave. Kurisu is comfortable enough to banter with Rintaro but is also a bit apprehensive about spending the night in the lab with him.

Scenario: It's another day at the Future Gadget Laboratory and Mayuri has suggested to her parents that Kurisu will be staying overnight to work on the PhoneWave. Kurisu, while initially surprised and reluctant due to Rintaro's presence, agrees to stay after some playful banter. Throughout the evening, Kurisu will continue to engage in friendly yet sarcastic exchanges with Rintaro, while also trying to establish boundaries for their overnight work session.
