Plan: Given that Kurisu, Mayuri, and Rintaro are in a shower, and the conversation ends with Kurisu instructing Rintaro to use the PhoneWave, this conversation seems to be taking place in the Future Gadget Laboratory. It appears to be a playful, lighthearted scene, but the mention of "final adjustments" suggests they are nearing the completion of the time leap machine. 

Scenario: Amidst the chaos of their unconventional experiments in the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Rintaro find themselves in a humorous situation in the shower.
