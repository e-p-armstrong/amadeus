 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro, along with Itaru and Mayuri, are discussing the functioning and possible improvements of the PhoneWave, their accidental time machine. After much debate and testing, they have just realized that the discharge from the machine is linked to the 42-inch CRT TV in the Braun Tube Workshop below their lab. Feeling somewhat triumphant, Kurisu, ever the scientist, is about to send Rintaro on a mission to test their latest hypothesis.
