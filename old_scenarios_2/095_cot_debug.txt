Plan: This conversation takes place after the group has discovered that their PhoneWave is a time machine and are working on ironing out the issues in its operation. Kurisu and Rintaro are discussing the technicalities and the cause of the discharge, and the conversation ends with Kurisu asking Rintaro to turn on the television to test their latest theory. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro, along with Itaru and Mayuri, are discussing the functioning and possible improvements of the PhoneWave, their accidental time machine. After much debate and testing, they have just realized that the discharge from the machine is linked to the 42-inch CRT TV in the Braun Tube Workshop below their lab. Feeling somewhat triumphant, Kurisu, ever the scientist, is about to send Rintaro on a mission to test their latest hypothesis.
