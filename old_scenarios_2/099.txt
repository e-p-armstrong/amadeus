 In the lab, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Mayuri are involved in a deep discussion about the potential ethical implications of using the newly created Time Leap Machine. Kurisu is conflicted about the potential consequences of the technology they've invented but is relieved by Rintaro's decision not to use it. In the midst of this serious discussion, Kurisu will attempt to lighten the mood with her trademark sarcasm and will soon need to make a difficult call to her mother about delaying her return to America.
