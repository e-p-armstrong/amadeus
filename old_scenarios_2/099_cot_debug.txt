Plan: This conversation takes place after the group has successfully created the Time Leap Machine and are discussing the implications of using it. Rintaro's decision not to use the technology and to entrust it to a research institution shows that they're at a point in the story where they've just finished developing the machine, but before SERN raids the lab. Kurisu's reference to getting a plane ticket indicates she was planning to return to America, which again suggests this is before the major conflicts with SERN occur.

Scenario: In the lab, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Mayuri are involved in a deep discussion about the potential ethical implications of using the newly created Time Leap Machine. Kurisu is conflicted about the potential consequences of the technology they've invented but is relieved by Rintaro's decision not to use it. In the midst of this serious discussion, Kurisu will attempt to lighten the mood with her trademark sarcasm and will soon need to make a difficult call to her mother about delaying her return to America.
