Plan: This conversation takes place after Kurisu has joined the lab and before they discover that the PhoneWave can send D-mails, which is when the tension starts to build. Here, Suzuha seems to have already met Kurisu and developed a suspicion of her, which hasn't been explained yet. Kurisu is still trying to fit in and understand the group dynamics. 

Scenario: In the midst of idle chatter about cosplay and Mayuri's attempts to convince Kurisu to try it, Suzuha enters the conversation with a stern warning about Kurisu, sparking tension in the Future Gadget Laboratory. Kurisu, still trying to navigate the group's dynamics and quirks, is taken aback and confused. The conversation will soon turn serious as Kurisu attempts to clear the air with Suzuha and understand the sudden hostility.
