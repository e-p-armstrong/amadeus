Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place after Rintaro has discovered his ability to retain his memories across different timelines, the "Reading Steiner". He seems to have just experienced a shift in timelines, which usually leaves him disoriented and panicky. Kurisu's initial conversation about shopping suggests a normal, peaceful situation that was abruptly disrupted by Rintaro's sudden change in demeanor.

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro were planning a casual shopping trip until Rintaro suddenly experiences another timeline shift, leaving him disoriented and confused. His screaming and erratic questioning clearly alarm Kurisu, who was only expecting a normal day out with her lab mates. Faced with Rintaro's panic, Kurisu will attempt to calm him down and understand what has just happened to him.
