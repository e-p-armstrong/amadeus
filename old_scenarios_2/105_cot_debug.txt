Plan: This conversation takes place during a tense moment when Moeka and her SERN associates are attempting to apprehend Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru. Given Moeka's mention of "Akihabara," this is likely taking place in or near the Future Gadget Laboratory, where the main characters spend most of their time. This scene likely occurs when SERN becomes aware of the group's time travel experiments.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are confronted by Moeka and her SERN associates, who have been alerted to their time travel experiments and are attempting to apprehend them. The atmosphere is tense and charged with uncertainty as the trio faces their first real threat. Kurisu, feeling cornered, will question Moeka, trying to understand the situation and buy some time.
