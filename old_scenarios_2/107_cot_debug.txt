Plan: This conversation is filled with panic and urgency, indicating a situation of high tension and danger. Given the references to the time machine and the fact that Moeka is present and hostile, it's likely that this scene is during the part of the story where SERN has discovered the lab and begun their attacks, after Rintaro starts trying to save Mayuri. The presence of Mayuri's voicemail message and Rintaro's desperate attempts to get in touch with her aligns with this theory.

Scenario: In the midst of a chaotic scene at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and his team are under threat from SERN, who have discovered their time travel experiments. Kurisu, filled with worry and fear, is trying to dissuade Rintaro from taking another risky leap through time in an attempt to save Mayuri. As tensions escalate, Kurisu will question Rintaro's sudden, dangerous plan, trying to bring him back to reason amidst the crisis.
