Plan: This conversation is clearly taking place within a tense situation where Rintaro is instructing Kurisu and Itaru to leave the lab and not to use the train. Given the sense of urgency and Rintaro's instructions, it seems likely this is when SERN has discovered their experiments and is about to raid the lab, leading up to Mayuri's death. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are suddenly thrown into a dire situation as Rintaro becomes aware of an imminent threat. The lighthearted atmosphere of their usual experimentation is shattered by Rintaro's urgent instructions for Kurisu and Itaru to leave Akiba and avoid their usual locations. Clueless of the impending danger, Kurisu will seek clarification from Rintaro, her usual sarcastic demeanor put aside due to the sudden seriousness of the situation.
