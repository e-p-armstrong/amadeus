Plan: This conversation takes place after the Time Leap Machine has been invented and after Mayuri's first death. The dialogue indicates that Rintaro has repeatedly used the Time Leap Machine, meaning Mayuri has died multiple times. Seeing Rintaro's despair and his plea for help, Kurisu decides to assist him, despite her reservations about the Time Leap Machine's usage.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, a desperate Rintaro stands before Kurisu, having just time-leaped from a timeline where Mayuri has died. Overwhelmed and lost, Rintaro is struggling to come to terms with his inability to save Mayuri despite his numerous attempts. Despite her initial reservations about the potential dangers of the Time Leap Machine, Kurisu, moved by Rintaro's desperation, will decide to help him save Mayuri.
