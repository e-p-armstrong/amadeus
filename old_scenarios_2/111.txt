 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, after a day of work and some light-hearted banter, Rintaro confesses to Kurisu that he's time-leaped from five hours in the future, much to her disbelief. The atmosphere in the lab has suddenly shifted from casual to intense, as they delve into serious discussion about the implications of time travel and the possibility of saving Mayuri. Despite her initial shock, Kurisu will start to analyze the situation scientifically, exploring theories like the 'chronology protection conjecture' and 'the many-worlds interpretation' to help Rintaro find a solution.
