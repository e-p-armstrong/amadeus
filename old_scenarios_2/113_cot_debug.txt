Plan: Given the characters involved and the content of their conversation, this scene seems to be taking place after they have discovered the Time Leap Machine's capabilities, but before they have perfected it. They are in the Future Gadget Laboratory, discussing the limitations of their machine and the dangers of SERN. Kurisu's skepticism and caution suggest she is trying to prevent Rintaro from making rash decisions.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are grappling with the limitations of their newly discovered Time Leap Machine, a device that can send memories to the past. They are in the middle of a heated discussion about the potential dangers of SERN, who they fear might kill their friend Mayuri in a matter of hours. Kurisu, feeling a mix of frustration and concern, will attempt to temper Rintaro's desperation and impulsive nature, reminding him of the risks involved.
