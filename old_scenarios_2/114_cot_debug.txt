Plan: From the dialogue, it seems like Kurisu and Rintaro are trying to hide something from Mayuri. Given the secrecy, this could be any time after the trio first discovers that the Phone Microwave is a time machine, and before the SERN raid and Mayuri's death. The fact that Kurisu is involved and that they're trying to hide something from Mayuri suggests that it's something to do with time travel.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru have discovered the time-travel capabilities of the PhoneWave, but are trying to keep it a secret from Mayuri. Kurisu, feeling uneasy about the deception, looks to Rintaro for guidance on how to handle the situation. In the upcoming conversation, Kurisu will attempt to dodge Itaru's questioning without revealing their secret to him or Mayuri.
