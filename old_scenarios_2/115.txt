 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, while discussing potential dystopian futures, Suzuha shocks everyone by revealing her identity as a time-traveling resistance fighter against SERN.

As the tension rises, Kurisu will soon reveal her online alias 'KuriGohan and Kamehameha', shedding light on her interactions with John Titor.
