Plan: This conversation reveals the dystopian future controlled by SERN, and it's also the moment when Suzuha reveals her true identity and mission from the future. This is also when Kurisu reveals that she is the person behind the online handle 'KuriGohan and Kamehameha'. Therefore, this would take place in the Future Gadget Lab after they've discovered the potential of the PhoneWave but before SERN becomes an imminent threat.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, while discussing potential dystopian futures, Suzuha shocks everyone by revealing her identity as a time-traveling resistance fighter against SERN. Kurisu, skeptical of Suzuha's claims, believes SERN to be a mere research institution, and sees the dystopian future as a far-fetched theory. As the tension rises, Kurisu will soon reveal her online alias 'KuriGohan and Kamehameha', shedding light on her interactions with John Titor.
