 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, the team is being briefed by Suzuha about the dystopian future where SERN rules the world and Kurisu is involuntarily involved in their time travel experiments.

As the conversation continues, Kurisu will grapple with her shock and concern, particularly about the safety of her mother, and will try to understand and potentially change this bleak future.
