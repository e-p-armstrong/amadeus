Plan: This conversation involves Suzuha explaining the concept of Attractor Fields, which is a critical component in understanding the function of time and timelines in Steins;Gate. Given that this is an explanation about the structure of time and space, it happens after Suzuha's identity as a time traveler from a dystopian future is revealed. Kurisu's question indicates she is trying to understand this complex concept better.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, after learning about Suzuha's true identity as a time-traveler and her mission, Kurisu and Rintaro are now being introduced to the concept of Attractor Fields and world lines - key elements in understanding the fabric of time and space. The atmosphere is tense and filled with a sense of urgency as they grapple with the grim reality of their situation and the complexity of time travel. Kurisu, in her relentless pursuit of knowledge, will question Suzuha further, hoping to fully grasp this new paradigm and its implications for their ongoing struggle against the dystopian future.
