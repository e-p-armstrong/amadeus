 Amidst a heated discussion in the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Kurisu, Itaru, and Suzuha are trying to wrap their heads around the intricate concept of Attractor Fields, likening it to a 'choose your own adventure' game. As they discuss their understanding and speculate about the implications of their time travel experiments, Kurisu, despite her skepticism, is open to learning more. With Suzuha's assertion about the possibility of jumping to a different Attractor Field, Kurisu will question and probe deeper into this newfound possibility, driven by her scientific curiosity.
