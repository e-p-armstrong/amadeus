 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Suzuha are deeply engaged in discussions and research related to the Time Leap machine. Kurisu is behaving rather defensively and is on edge, likely due to the tension of their experiments and Rintaro's recent time leaps. In the upcoming conversation, Kurisu will confront Rintaro about their progress, specifically about the crucial 'lifter' component of the Time Leap machine.
