Plan: This conversation revolves around the Time Leap machine and the discovery of the "lifter", which is a critical part of the machine. It's a serious discussion about their ongoing research into time travel, and it seems like it takes place after Rintaro has made several time leaps, but before the crisis with SERN. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Suzuha are deeply engaged in discussions and research related to the Time Leap machine. Kurisu is behaving rather defensively and is on edge, likely due to the tension of their experiments and Rintaro's recent time leaps. In the upcoming conversation, Kurisu will confront Rintaro about their progress, specifically about the crucial 'lifter' component of the Time Leap machine.
