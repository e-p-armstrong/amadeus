Plan: In this dialogue, Kurisu is discussing the Time Leap Machine and the Reading Steiner ability with Suzuha and Rintaro. This conversation occurs after they have developed the Time Leap Machine but before they start using it extensively. They are at the Future Gadget Laboratory, discussing the technicalities and mysteries of time leaping and Reading Steiner.

Scenario: As they complete the Time Leap Machine in the cluttered Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro, along with time-traveler Suzuha, find themselves intrigued and puzzled by the mechanics of time leaping and the unique phenomenon of Rintaro's Reading Steiner ability. Kurisu, a brilliant scientist driven by curiosity, is left somewhat frustrated by the unknowns surrounding the inexplicable link between memory and consciousness in relation to time travel. With more questions than answers, Kurisu will soon delve deeper into these mysteries, trying to unravel the fundamental principles that govern their newly invented time-leaping technology.
