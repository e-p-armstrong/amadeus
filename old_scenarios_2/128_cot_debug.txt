Plan: Given that Suzuha is giving Rintaro a pin and asking him to keep it in the lab, and Itaru's suggestion of making duplicates for all 'lab mems' (members), this conversation likely occurs after Suzuha has revealed her identity as a time-traveller, but before the raid by SERN. Kurisu's sarcastic comment to Itaru suggests a level of comfort and familiarity between the lab members.

Scenario: Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, after Suzuha's revelation of her time-travelling identity, she gives Rintaro a pin to keep as a memento. In this calm before the storm period, the lab members, including Kurisu, are feeling a sense of camaraderie and unity, even as they remain unaware of the danger that lies ahead. Kurisu, comfortable with her newfound friends, will continue to showcase her sharp wit and sarcasm, in particular, towards Itaru's unexpectedly thoughtful proposal.
