Plan: This conversation seems to be happening after a physically exhausting event involving running, given Kurisu's out-of-breath statements. Given Itaru's comment about Suzuha's age, it seems like this conversation takes place after the reveal of Suzuha being Itaru's daughter from the future, which happens quite later into the story. The reference to the difference in age between Itaru and Suzuha suggests that they've just returned from a time-travel mission.

Scenario: After an intense time travel mission, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru find themselves back in the Future Gadget Laboratory, catching their breath and processing the surreal experiences. Kurisu is feeling physically exhausted, yet her mind is racing with the implications of their recent actions. In the following conversation, Kurisu will attempt to lighten the mood by teasing Itaru about the bizarre reality of time travel and its implications on familial relationships.
