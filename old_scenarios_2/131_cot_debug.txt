Plan: The conversation seems to be happening during a crisis or after a failed experiment, given the tension and anger in Rintaro's voice. Kurisu is trying to mediate between Rintaro and Itaru, suggesting that they have all been working together on an experiment. This could be one of the many times they attempt to use the Phone Microwave or Time Leap machine, and something has gone wrong.

Scenario: In the midst of a heated argument inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are grappling with the aftermath of a failed experiment, likely involving the Phone Microwave or Time Leap machine. Kurisu, despite the tension, maintains her calm, analytical demeanor, serving as the voice of reason in the room. She will attempt to diffuse the situation, defending Itaru's efforts and urging Rintaro to calm down and think rationally.
