 The lab members have taken a break from their usual lab activities, and ventured outdoors in search of the vital pin needed for the IBN 5100. Kurisu, slightly out of her element and preferring to work on the time leap machine, expresses concern over Rintaro's exhaustion from their search, highlighting her growing care for him and the group. Despite her apparent discomfort in the outdoors, she will continue to support the team's efforts in finding the pin.
