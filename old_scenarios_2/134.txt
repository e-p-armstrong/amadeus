 In the aftermath of the bustling ComiMa, Kurisu, Suzuha, Itaru, and Mayuri are standing in the now deserted convention center, discussing their experiences and deciding on their next steps. Having delved deeper into their time travel experiments and understanding the potential implications of D-Mails, Kurisu is particularly alert and suspicious about any unusual occurrences. Despite the exhaustion from the day, Kurisu is determined to keep a watchful eye for any signs of D-Mail use, even while they plan to grab a meal and cycle back home.
