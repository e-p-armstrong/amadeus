Plan: The conversation suggests they are in a large, open area that is usually crowded during ComiMa (Comic Market), a massive convention for selling self-published work (mainly manga) in Japan. This indicates that they're not in the lab, and instead they're on a field trip of sorts. The mention of having to bike back suggests they've traveled a fair distance from their usual setting.

Scenario: After a day of exploration, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru find themselves in the vast, empty space usually bustling with activity during the ComiMa event. They've ventured out of the confines of the Future Gadget Laboratory, taking a break from their usual experiments. Feeling the fatigue from their day-long excursion, Kurisu will soon express her annoyance at the daunting prospect of a long bike ride back to the lab.
