Plan: This conversation happens after the lab members have realized the full potential of the Phone Microwave and the Time Leap Machine. They have been experimenting with D-mails and time leaping, but the conversation suggests that Kurisu is worried about the potential consequences. She is also trying to understand the relationships within the group, hinting at her growing closeness to them.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, the research team is discussing their recent experiments with the Time Leap Machine, but Kurisu is growing increasingly concerned about the ethical and practical implications of their actions. Meanwhile, she is also trying to navigate the complex dynamics and relationships within the group, showing her growing investment in their lives. As the conversation continues, she will voice her concerns about using the Time Leap Machine and push Rintaro to consider the possible ramifications of their experiments.
