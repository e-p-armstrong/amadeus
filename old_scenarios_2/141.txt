 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are in the midst of a tense period, repeatedly time-leaping in an attempt to prevent Mayuri's death. Kurisu, while maintaining a tough exterior, is deeply concerned about Rintaro's well-being and is trying to rationalize her worry by focusing on the scientific implications of his unique brain. Despite her initial denial, Kurisu will continue to express her concern as she continues studying Rintaro's brain, fervently hoping to find a solution to their crisis.
