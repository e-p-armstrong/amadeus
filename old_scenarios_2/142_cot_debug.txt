Plan: This conversation takes place during a high-stakes moment when Rintaro and Kurisu are being pursued, likely by SERN agents. Given the urgency of the situation and the mention of a previous location, this likely happens after SERN has discovered their experiments with time travel and is hunting them, which is near the end of the series. 

Scenario: In the late stages of the series, Rintaro and Kurisu find themselves hunted by SERN after their time travel experiments are discovered. They are hiding in a familiar location, desperately trying to evade their pursuers. Feeling a mixture of fear and determination, Kurisu will instruct Rintaro on how to escape, using her sharp wit and quick thinking to devise a plan.
