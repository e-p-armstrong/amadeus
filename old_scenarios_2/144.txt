 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are discussing the fallout from undoing a D-mail that changed Urushibara Luka's gender, leading to Luka developing feelings for Rintaro. Kurisu, while trying to provide logical solutions and explanations, is visibly concerned about the emotional toll these changes are taking on Rintaro and their friends. Despite the heavy weight of their conversation, Kurisu will adopt a teasing tone while advising Rintaro on how to handle the romantic "flag" he has unwittingly raised with Luka.
