 Rintaro and Kurisu are at Yanabayashi Shrine, having a conversation with Luka, who has recently used a D-mail to change their gender from male to female. Kurisu, carrying a slight tinge of annoyance due to Rintaro's constant interruptions, is attempting to explain the differences between male and female brains to Luka. As the conversation continues, Kurisu, oblivious to Luka's discomfort, will propose a brain mapping experiment to determine if Luka's brain patterns align more with females or males.
