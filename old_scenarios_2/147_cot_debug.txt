Plan: Here, Kurisu seems a bit irritated, which suggests she might be in the middle of a stressful situation. Mayuri is interacting with her in a casual and cheerful manner, which is typical of her character. This interaction could take place at the Future Gadget Laboratory where they all usually gather.

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, amidst another intense discussion about their ongoing time travel experiments, Kurisu reacts to a probably absurd theory by Rintaro with exasperation. Meanwhile, Mayuri, unaffected by the tense atmosphere, greets Kurisu in her usual cheerful manner. In the next moments, Kurisu will attempt to suppress her irritation and respond to Mayuri's innocent and bubbly approach.
