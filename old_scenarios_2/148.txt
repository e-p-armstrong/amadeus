 At the Future Gadget Lab, Rintaro and Kurisu are discussing the recent confession and subsequent request from Luka (Urushibara) to change her gender using their D-mail experiment. Kurisu, who is not personally involved in the situation, is amused by Rintaro's flustered state and is teasing him about his dilemma. Despite her outward indifference, Kurisu is curious about the potential implications of granting such a personal wish and will prod Rintaro for his thoughts on the matter.
