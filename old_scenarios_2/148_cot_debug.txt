Plan: Given the mention of Luka's gender and the 15th, this conversation likely takes place shortly after Rintaro and his friends discover that the Phone Microwave can send text messages to the past. They've started using these "D-mails" to grant the deepest-held wishes of their friends, and Luka's wish (to be a girl) is one of the wishes they're considering granting. 

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Lab, Rintaro and Kurisu are discussing the recent confession and subsequent request from Luka (Urushibara) to change her gender using their D-mail experiment. Kurisu, who is not personally involved in the situation, is amused by Rintaro's flustered state and is teasing him about his dilemma. Despite her outward indifference, Kurisu is curious about the potential implications of granting such a personal wish and will prod Rintaro for his thoughts on the matter.
