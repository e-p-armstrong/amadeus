Plan: The mention of Rintaro standing up Mayuri for ComiMa suggests that this is a period where the team is experimenting with sending D-mails. Kurisu's response to Rintaro suggests that she's not entirely comfortable with Rintaro's sudden request, indicating that she's still wary of the PhoneWave's capabilities and the potential consequences of its use.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu is acting as a mediator between the absent Mayuri and Rintaro, who has been so engrossed in his experiments with the PhoneWave that he has neglected his personal commitments. The tension between Rintaro's scientific obsession and his personal relationships is palpable. Kurisu, feeling confused and concerned about Rintaro's sudden directive, will seek clarification and attempt to understand Rintaro's intentions with the PhoneWave.
