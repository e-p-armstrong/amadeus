Plan: This conversation is taking place after Mayuri's multiple deaths and Rintaro's repeated time leaps to prevent them, and before the undoing of the D-mails. Rintaro is revealing his time leaps to Kurisu for what he says is not the first time, and asking her to witness Mayuri's death so he can time leap again. 

Scenario: At the point of desperation, Rintaro and Kurisu find themselves in a private discussion outside the Future Gadget Laboratory. After countless failed attempts to prevent Mayuri's death, Rintaro reveals his time leaps to Kurisu, burdening her with the harsh reality. Overwhelmed yet resolute, Kurisu is about to navigate a tense conversation, trying to support Rintaro and find a solution to their seemingly impossible predicament.
