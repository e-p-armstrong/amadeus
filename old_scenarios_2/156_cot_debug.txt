Plan: Given Kurisu's concern about Rintaro's location and her focus on the PhoneWave, this conversation likely falls within the latter half of the series when Rintaro is attempting to undo the D-mails. The mention of Moeka and SERN suggests Rintaro is attempting to undo the D-mail he sent for her.

Scenario: After a series of D-mail reversals to save Mayuri, Rintaro is on a dangerous mission to retrieve the IBN 5100 from Kiryu Moeka, an agent of SERN, at her apartment. Kurisu, back at the Future Gadget Laboratory, is anxious about Rintaro's safety and is trying to keep the PhoneWave operational. As the conversation progresses, Kurisu will dispense harsh, pragmatic advice, demonstrating the lengths she's willing to go to ensure the mission's success and the survival of their friend, Mayuri.
