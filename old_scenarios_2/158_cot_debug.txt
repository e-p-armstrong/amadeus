Plan: Kurisu is at the Future Gadget Lab and Rintaro is elsewhere. They are discussing time-leaping, specifically sending D-mails, to alter past events. The conversation's context and Rintaro's frustration hint at the latter part of the series where they are trying to undo the effects of the D-mails to return to the original timeline. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu waits alone for Rintaro's instructions, ready to aid him with the D-mail experiments. They are deep into the process of undoing the D-mails, which have caused significant changes in their timelines. Kurisu will assist Rintaro in his efforts to craft an effective D-mail, despite her fatigue and worry for his well-being, in a desperate bid to restore their reality.
