Plan: This conversation happens in the latter part of the series, after Rintaro has started undoing the D-mails to prevent Mayuri's death. They are in the process of convincing Moeka to let them undo her D-mail, and the mention of FB confirms this. The mention of a gunshot and Nae implies that this is the part where Nae stabs Moeka, before running away.

Scenario: Rintaro, Kurisu, and Moeka are in Moeka's apartment, having just convinced her to help them undo the D-mail that made her a SERN rounder. There's a heavy atmosphere, filled with tension and regret, as they grapple with the consequences of their earlier actions with the Phone Microwave. Kurisu, feeling a mix of guilt and resolve, will urge Rintaro to focus on their task of saving Mayuri by undoing the D-mails, and will attempt to contact Itaru to initiate the D-mail cancellation.
