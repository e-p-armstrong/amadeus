Plan: From the conversation, it's clear that a crisis has just occurred, involving Moeka (Kiryu-san). Given the mention of the D-Mail, this likely takes place in the latter part of the series when the group is actively using the Phone Microwave to send messages to the past. Since Kurisu is recommending using the D-Mail, it can be assumed that this is one of the times when Rintaro is trying to undo the wishes of his friends.

Scenario: After a tense encounter with Moeka, Rintaro and Kurisu are left in a state of shock and urgency in the Future Gadget Laboratory. A sense of panic fills the room as Rintaro struggles to process what has happened and Kurisu, while equally shocked, attempts to maintain control of the situation. Trying to manage the crisis, Kurisu will suggest using the D-Mail to revert the events that have just transpired.
