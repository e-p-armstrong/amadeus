Plan: This conversation has Rintaro asking Kurisu about Moeka's apartment, which indicates that they are already familiar with Moeka and have sent a D-mail for her. Rintaro's calling for Daru suggests he has something important to discuss or do with him. The mention of ComiMa suggests that this is during a period when the lab members have a relatively calm life, before SERN becomes a serious threat.

Scenario: After having sent D-mails for friends such as Moeka, Rintaro, Kurisu, and the rest of the lab members are gathered in the Future Gadget Laboratory, continuing their research on the Phone Microwave. It's a calm period where they can still enjoy events like ComiMa, with Daru being absent for this very reason. Kurisu, appearing slightly confused, will answer Rintaro's questions and remind him of Daru's whereabouts.
