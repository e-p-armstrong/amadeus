Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place after the team has acquired the IBN 5100, but before they have made any significant breakthroughs with it. As such, it's likely during the period when they're experimenting with the D-mails but before SERN becomes aware of their activities. The group is in the lab, and Kurisu is likely there to assist with the research.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Itaru, and Kurisu are discussing the potential uses for the recently acquired IBN 5100. While Rintaro and Itaru are engaged in their usual banter, Kurisu is focused on the task at hand. Feeling frustrated by their lack of seriousness, she will soon admonish them for their distractions and push them to concentrate on the research.
