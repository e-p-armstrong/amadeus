Plan: Given the serious nature of the conversation and the topics discussed (deletion of the D-mail, the Beta worldline, Kurisu's death and Attractor fields), this conversation is likely taking place in the later portion of the series, after Rintaro has discovered that saving Mayuri would require Kurisu's death. 

Scenario: In an isolated corner of Akihabara, Kurisu finds Rintaro, who has been acting out of character after the heavy realization that he must choose between saving Mayuri or Kurisu. Overwhelmed by guilt and fear, Rintaro reveals the harsh truth to Kurisu, leaving her stunned, but she will attempt to find a logical flaw in the Attractor Field Theory, in hopes of finding a solution that could potentially save them both.
