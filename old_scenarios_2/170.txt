 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, and Rintaro are deep in a discussion about the theory of worldlines and time travel, as Rintaro wrestles with the painful decision he might have to make. Kurisu, aware of the gravity of the situation, tries to lighten the mood and alleviate Rintaro's guilt by proposing a hypothesis that even if she dies in one worldline, she could be alive in another. She will continue to challenge Rintaro's beliefs and attempt to assuage his fears, even as she herself grapples with the concept of her potential death.
