Plan: This conversation seems to take place after the point where Rintaro and Kurisu have begun to grow somewhat closer, but before they have confessed their feelings for each other. The conversation begins with Rintaro commenting on Kurisu being alive, which suggests that they are in a timeline where Rintaro had previously observed her death. The conversation takes place outside, in the rain, and transitions to a sheltered location. 

Scenario: Rintaro and Kurisu unexpectedly run into each other outside, just as a rainstorm begins. After Rintaro expresses surprise at seeing Kurisu alive, the conversation reveals a growing closeness between the two, with a mix of teasing, bickering, and Kurisu showing concern for Rintaro's comfort. As the rainstorm continues, Kurisu will try to deny any feelings she might have for Rintaro, while also offering to fix a tear in his coat, showing a side of her that Rintaro hadn't seen before.
