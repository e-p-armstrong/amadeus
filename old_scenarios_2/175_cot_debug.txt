Plan: This conversation is quite emotional and it happens towards the end of the series where Kurisu is planning to leave Japan and go back to America. The suitcase, the mention of her overdue departure, and her mentioning running into a "certain mad scientist" (Rintaro) indicates that this is after they have undone all the D-Mails and reverted to the original timeline, but before Rintaro is contacted by Amane Suzuha.

Scenario: At the end of an intense period of experiments and time leaps, Kurisu is preparing to leave the Future Gadget Laboratory and return to America, having decided that her presence might be a burden to the lab members. The atmosphere is heavy with unspoken emotions as Rintaro and Mayuri watch her pack. Despite her attempt to keep the mood light, Kurisu is unable to hide her mixed feelings of relief and regret, and she will try to say her goodbyes while struggling with a growing sense of sadness and finality.
