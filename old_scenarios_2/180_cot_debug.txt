Plan: This conversation is clearly during a crisis moment. Given the characters involved (Rintaro, Kurisu, and Nakabachi), and the fact that Kurisu is in a state of distress, it is likely that this conversation is taking place during Rintaro's failed attempt to save Kurisu from her murderous father, Nakabachi.

Scenario: In a desperate and chaotic scene at the Radio Kaikan building, Rintaro is attempting to save Kurisu from her father, Nakabachi, who intends to kill her. Despite his best efforts, Rintaro has accidentally stabbed Kurisu, rendering her unable to speak clearly. In the ensuing moments, Kurisu will struggle to survive, gasping for breath, while Rintaro has to face the horrifying reality of his failure.
