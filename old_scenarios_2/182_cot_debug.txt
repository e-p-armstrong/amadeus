Plan: This seems to be a pivotal point in the series where Rintaro has decided to save Kurisu, even though it means disrupting the timeline. This is likely towards the end of the series when Kurisu and Rintaro have confessed their feelings for each other. It also seems to be in the Future Gadget Laboratory, given the mention of "coming down", likely referring to the stairs in the lab.

Scenario: In the tense atmosphere of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro is grappling with the decision to save Kurisu, knowing the potential consequences on the timeline. Kurisu, still blissfully unaware of the future that awaits her, is caught off guard by Rintaro's sudden and intense proclamation. The conversation will see Rintaro, driven by his feelings for Kurisu, declaring his intent to alter time once again to save her, leaving Kurisu shocked and unsure of what he means.
