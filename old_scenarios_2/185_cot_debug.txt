Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place during a crisis. Given that Rintaro is saying he's going to save Kurisu, it's likely that this is the scene where Rintaro is about to make a time leap to try and save Kurisu's life. This would be towards the end of the series, when the stakes are high and Rintaro has failed to prevent the death of Mayuri multiple times.

Scenario: In the tense atmosphere of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro has just been injured, prompting Kurisu's urgent call for medical attention. Amidst escalating threats from SERN, Rintaro is determined to save his friends, yet he's physically incapacitated. Despite her worry and confusion, Kurisu will attempt to calm Rintaro down and seek help, unknowing of the time leap Rintaro is about to take to alter their fates.
