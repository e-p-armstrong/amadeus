Plan: The conversation suggests that this is taking place in the final episode of the series, after Rintaro has managed to reach the "Steins Gate" timeline where both Mayuri and Kurisu are alive. Kurisu mentions being saved by Rintaro, which hints towards the staged death event. The conversation then takes a turn to the familiar banter between the two, with Kurisu denying being called "Christina", showing that she has some residual memories from the other timelines.

Scenario: In the bustling streets of Akihabara, Kurisu unexpectedly comes across Rintaro after he has successfully reached the "Steins Gate" timeline where Mayuri and she are both alive, following a series of gruelling time leaps and D-mails. Kurisu feels an overwhelming sense of gratitude towards Rintaro for saving her life, even though she doesn't fully understand why, due to the complex workings of timelines and alternate realities. As their conversation progresses, Kurisu will instinctively react to Rintaro's teasing, hinting at her lingering memories from their shared experiences in other timelines.
