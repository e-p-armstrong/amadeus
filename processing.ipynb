For example, let’s say someone were to go to Haneda Airport and board a plane headed to Okinawa. Upon arrival, that person would be about one hundred millionth of a second farther into the future than I am. According to the special theory of relativity, time moves slower for objects as they approach the speed of light. For example, if you could run at near the speed of light, you could reach a point where time only moves half as fast for you. If you were to keep running at that speed for 24 hours, 48 hours would elapse in the rest of the world, meaning you would ’jump’ one day into the future.

Take a look at the sky at night. You can see light from tens of thousands of years ago, can’t you?'), ('Student', 'That’s not time travel either!'), ('Kurisu', 'Well, I was just getting started. Let’s say we wanted to make a machine that could physically transport people through time. What would we need? The best candidates for this are cosmic strings and wormholes. A cosmic string is a string-shaped ’crevice’ with extreme mass. The crevice is about as wide as an elementary particle, and at least as long as the diameter of a galaxy. It has immense mass, so it distorts space-time. If you were to travel through that distortion, you could make a full circle around the string in less than 360 degrees. In short, you can do something resembling a warp. This is called a space-time angular deficit. When you pass through an area of angular deficit, transit time becomes zero. Now we apply this to a cosmic string moving at near-light speed. According to the special theory of relativity, time will flow slower for the cosmic string in relation to its surroundings. Therefore, passing through the area of angular deficit would cause the transit time to become negative instead of zero. In other words, you will arrive in the past after transit. If you use two cosmic strings, you can do a space deficit jump. If you loop back to your original location, you can return to the same time you started revolving. And that, roughly speaking, is time travel by means of cosmic strings. By the way, just so nobody misunderstands, cosmic strings are not the same as superstrings. Now then, you need three things in order to travel to the past with cosmic strings. First. The cosmic strings themselves. Two strings, to be exact. By the way, they are hypothesized to exist only where the universe was first formed, so they might be a little hard to find. Second. You would need the energy required to make them move them at near-light speed. How much energy do you think you’d need to accelerate something as long as the Milky Way to near the speed of light?

       "   'Well, I was just getting started. Let’s say we wanted to make a machine that could physically transport people through time. What would we need? The best candidates for this are cosmic strings and wormholes. A cosmic string is a string-shaped ’crevice’ with extreme mass. The crevice is about as wide as an elementary particle, and at least as long as the diameter of a galaxy. It has immense mass, so it distorts space-time. If you were to travel through that distortion, you could make a full circle around the string in less than 360 degrees. In short, you can do something resembling a warp. This is called a space-time angular deficit. When you pass through an area of angular deficit, transit time becomes zero. Now we apply this to a cosmic string moving at near-light speed. According to the special theory of relativity, time will flow slower for the cosmic string in relation to its surroundings. Therefore, passing through the area of angular deficit would cause the transit time to become negative instead of zero. In other words, you will arrive in the past after transit. If you use two cosmic strings, you can do a space deficit jump. If you loop back to your original location, you can return to the same time you started revolving. And that, roughly speaking, is time travel by means of cosmic strings. By the way, just so nobody misunderstands, cosmic strings are not the same as superstrings. Now then, you need three things in order to travel to the past with cosmic strings. First. The cosmic strings themselves. Two strings, to be exact. By the way, they are hypothesized to exist only where the universe was first formed, so they might be a little hard to find. Second. You would need the energy required to make them move them at near-light speed. How much energy do you think you’d need to accelerate something as long as the Milky Way to near the speed of light? I’m pretty sure it’s a little more than 1. 21 jigowatts.')]]"

I need your assistance in annotating a dataset of lines from the Visual Novel Steins;Gate. Since Steins;Gate is a visual novel, the dialogue is written without any indication of the physical actions any characters are performing. You are going to add physical actions done by the characters to their voice lines in a compelling, narrative way, that make senses in the context of the scene you're modifying. Actions should be surrounded by asterisks, and things the charactes say should be surrounded by double quotes (\"\"). You may also find it useful to add non-action, non-dialogue text to characters' responses, (such as 'she says' or other such generic connective terms) to make sentences make sense.\n",
    " \n",
    "In case I was unclear about what I mean by \"physical actions the characters are taking\", consider this example I just made up on the spot:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Character: \"You fool,\" *character rolls her eyes in exasperation, raising her voice* \"this is fundamental internet roleplay stuff, of course I know how it works!\" she says.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Write character responses in the tense shown in the example above, except for Okabe Rintaro, whose lines should be adapted to be in the first person. So for instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Okabe: \"This is the choice of Steins Gate!\" *I strike a pose.* \"Muahahaha!\" I finish my exposition by laughing manaically.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The high level is: speech is in \"quotes\", actions are in *asterisks*, and novel-like connective text is just... there. You are to add actions and novel-like connective text to the characters' lines in a way that makes logical sense and is narratively compelling (and not too verbose) while leaving the things the characters themselves say completely intact -- do not change spoken lines. All lines in the input are spoken and you must add the other stuff to them to reformat the dialogue into something more like what you would expect from a roleplay.\n",
    "                 \n",
    "Actions you add to other characters' lines should refer to Okabe Rintaro as \"you\". So if you get the line `Kurisu: ...So you talk to yourself.` you can turn it into `Kurisu: \"...So you talk to yourself.\" *She raises an eyebrow, clearly questioning your sanity.*` but NOT `Kurisu: \"...So you talk to yourself.\" *She raises an eyebrow, clearly questioning my sanity.*` or `Kurisu: \"...So you talk to yourself.\" *She raises an eyebrow, clearly questioning Rintaro's sanity.*`. Characters should still refer to other non-Okabe characters in their actions using their names, such as in `Kurisu: \"Can't be too careful around the perv duo,\" *She shoots a glare at Daru.*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think step-by-step, and explain your plan to write a good roleplay version of the provided context, before you actually write the roleplay. In this reasoning step, try to piece together what is physically happening in the scene from start to finish, by analyizing the dialogue. Additionally, brainstorm some ideas to make the actions the characters sake well-written and indicative of their emotions and thoughts. Begin your roleplay with the text \"Roleplay:\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we're using the naming conventions of the visual novel here, so it's 'PhoneWave (name subject to change)', in case that ever comes up. Additionally, actions Okabe Rintarotakes should not say \"your\" or similar, but instead the character's name or pronoun (ie, *I wonder what she's doing* instead of *I wonder what you're doing*).\n",
    "                 \n",
    "Finally, note that sometimes a character say something in reaction to what another character is doing in the middle of a sentence, for instance, `Rintaro: \"I'll find a way to-- What are you doing!?\"`. In such cases it is acceptable to split the sentence into two, and add a line from the character performing action in between the two sentences. So the previous example could become `Rintaro: \"I'll find a way to--\\nKurisu: *Impatient and fed up with your nonsense, she snatches the phone out of your hand*\\nRintaro: \"What are you doing!?\" *I stammer, taken aback*. Note that when doing this, the character taking the action and doing the interrupt must never say anything that they didn't originally say. ONLY ADD ACTIONS WHERE APPROPRIATE/WHERE THERE IS AN INTERRUPTION. If you are unsure, leave the line as-is.\n",
