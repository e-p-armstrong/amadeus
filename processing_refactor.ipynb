I lose myself in thought as I drink it. It's Saturday, so it's starting to get crowded in front of the station. Some maids are distributing leaflets to the people coming out. I know Daru's well-acquainted with retro PCs, but is there anyone else? Oh yeah, Shining Finger was obsessed with the IBN 5100, wasn't she? I'm really reluctant to contact that mail demon, though... But ultimately, my feelings are trivial. Ragnarok hangs in the balance. I don't know Shining Finger's phone number, so I'll just send her an email for the time being. Once I finish drinking my juice, I aimlessly head towards Chuo-dori. And then comes an email. It's from Shining Finger. That's a quick reply. But I asked her to call, so why did she reply by email? But I decide not to bother. I finish my drink and wander towards Chuo-dori. Then comes an email, almost as if on cue. Don't tell me... is it the mail demon? Tch, it's like she can read my mind. I instinctively scan the area, searching for that gloomy woman in the crowd. No sign of her tailing me. Oh well. I guess I'll send her a reply. I don't know Shining Finger's phone number, so I'll just send her an email for the time being. In the email, I ask her to call, and include my phone number. Now I just have to wait for her response. And there it is. That's a quick reply. But I asked her to call, so why did she reply by email? Wait, she wants it by email? There's a lot to cover. I'd rather not have to type it all out. I need to find out her phone number. Give me your phone number, along with any information you have on the IBN 5100. And... send. I look up after finishing my email and see a huge crowd of people in front of Radi-Kan. I guess the satellite is still a big deal. The media presence hasn't died down since the day of the crash either. Radi-Kan is still closed. And, of course, the satellite is still there. Not 30 seconds pass before I get a reply.

I need your assistance in annotating a dataset of lines from the Visual Novel Steins;Gate. Since Steins;Gate is a visual novel, the dialogue is written without much indication of the physical actions any characters are performing. You are going to add physical actions done by the characters to their voice lines in a compelling, narrative way, that make senses in the context of the scene you're modifying. Actions should be surrounded by asterisks, and things the charactes say should be surrounded by double quotes (\"\"). You may also find it useful to add non-action, non-dialogue text to characters' responses, (such as 'she says' or other such generic connective terms) to make sentences make sense.\n",
