Your task is to write the context for an interaction between Kurisu and Okabe from the visual novel Steins;Gate in a \"scenario\" -- a 5-sentence summary about what's happened until the point the interaction STARTS at (writing under the assumption that the reader knows who Kurisu is, and what some of her general traits are). You should use the lines provided to help determine the context behind a given scene.\n",

Your goal is to describe, in generic terms, the conversation's SETTING, at the START of the conversation (as well as what Kurisu is feeling and trying to do) instead of being to summarize it. This context should make sense if the reader only had access to the first line said by Kurisu in the conversation (and the lines immediately preceding it).\n",

    "Kurisu turns out to be alive. Rintaro and friends, including Mayuri and Daru, discover their \"Phone Microwave\" sends texts, or \"D-mails,\" to the past. They use D-mails to fulfill wishes for friends like Moeka, Faris, Luka, and Suzuha. Kurisu joins the lab and helps improve the time machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rintaro alone remembers original timelines due to his \"Reading Steiner\" ability. They also create \"Time Leaps,\" sending memories to the past. However, SERN discovers them, raids the lab, and kills Mayuri. Rintaro time-leaps repeatedly but can't save her.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix things, Rintaro, aided by Kurisu, undoes all D-mails, causing personal pain. They grow closer, but Rintaro realizes the first D-mail about Kurisu's \"death\" caused Mayuri's fate. Undoing it means sacrificing Kurisu, which he reluctantly does to save Mayuri.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-traveler Suzuha then contacts Rintaro, urging him to prevent World War 3 by saving Kurisu. Rintaro accidentally kills her himself, but gets advice from his future self on reaching a timeline—Steins Gate—where both friends live. He succeeds by faking Kurisu's death.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Steins Gate timeline, Rintaro and Kurisu encounter each other, experiencing déjà vu from past timelines.]\n",
    "\n",
    "Take special care to write a scenario that would make sense to someone ignorant of the overall plot of Steins;Gate. IE, you are not just trying to write a scenario that makes sense only when viewed alongside the plot summary; you are writing something that gives adequate context to a scene by itself alone. Instead of using Steins;Gate specific terminology, you will use generic words and explanations to give context to a scene.\n",

Keep the scenario 5 sentences long at most. Instead of mentioning events in the far future, you will concentrate on the event at hand and the things that led up to it.\"\"\"},\n",

It must be mortifying to be exposed as a fraud by a bright young man like myself. Anyway, I mustn't draw any more attention to myself. If the Organization gets wind of my presence here, it could endanger Mayuri -- to say nothing of these ignorant civilians. I let Makise Kurisu lead me out of the assembly hall.\n",

Towards the end of the scene, he becomes more cautious and wary when interacting with Kurisu. His actions should reflect this change in demeanor. Kurisu on the other hand, remains calm and collected throughout, her actions should reflect her confusion and curiosity about Okabe's behavior. I will be careful to ensure all UNSPOKEN lines are either incorporated into a character's line, or are removed. It makes sense to drop UNSPOKEN lines that are only exposition.\n",

The writing should be powerful and nuanced, conveying small details that reveal characters' motivations, personalities, and thoughts, without overtly stating them — it should be deep and poetic at once. About 4–5 sentences long (60-70 words per enhanced line).\n",
    "1. Write using a variety of words and immense stylistic flair appropriate to the scene. Be creative and prioritize making the new lines compelling instead of 100% accurate to the original. Alternate short, snappy responses with long and detailed prose to give the text a good rhythm.\n",
    "2. BE SURE to write the CORRECT speaker for any given line, I have seen a few cases where you accidentally switch who is saying a line and that messes up the whole scene. Also, do not break the important roleplay rule whereby characters should not act on behalf of other characters: Okabe should not think or take *actions* during one of Kurisu's lines, for instance. No one but the character whose line it is should speak on that line.\n",
    "3. IMPORTANT: the writing should be powerful and nuanced, conveying small details that reveal characters' motivations, personalities, and thoughts, often without overtly stating them — it should be deep and poetic at once, and ought to make up for the lack of a visual element in plain text. \n",
