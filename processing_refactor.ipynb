As I explained to Alpacaman, the lab’s primary goal is to develop weapons for the war against the Dark Dominion, led by the Organization, that rules the world from the shadows. At present, we haven’t completed any inventions of that sort. On the contrary. We haven’t even figured out what we should make. But along the way, we have managed to create some ingenious Future-ish Gadgets as a byproduct of our research. It is a fundamental truth of science that great inventions are often created by accident. In other words, serendipity. Allow me to introduce our glorious Future Gadgets. Gadget No. 1, the Bit Particle Gun. Gadget No. 2, the Bamboo Helicam. Gadget No. 3, Could This Be Ora Ora!?. Gadget No. 4, Moad Snake. Gadget No. 5, ’Once Again I’ve Made A Worthless Object’ by Goemon. Gadget No. 6, the Cyalume Saber. Gadget No. 7, Ghost in the Ball. They can all be seen on the website Daru made, so feast your eyes upon the product of a mad scientist’s genius. Anyway, our current problem is Future Gadget No. 8, the PhoneWave (name subject to change). PhoneWave is a pretty weak name, so I’ve added (name subject to change) to the end until we come up with something better. For the record, it was Mayuri’s idea, not mine. When a Future Gadget is completed, the three of us discuss what to name it. I prefer names based on mythology, or names with hidden meanings that need extra explanation to understand. Daru thinks my naming style too ridiculous. He just doesn’t have a passion for words like I do. Mayuri can’t be bothered to remember difficult names. She says they don’t fit in her head. And so, our opinions on gadget names are always split. But I digress. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is, in short, a remote-controlled microwave. You put food into the microwave before you leave, then on your way back, call the attached cellphone to start the heating process. Voila! Hot food ready for your arrival. ...So it’s basically a piece of junk. A few days ago, however, we discovered that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) has a second, unintended capability. Our brave -- or possibly just ditzy -- Mayuri had made it her daily routine to heat some frozen fried chicken by remote control. Long story short, she was defrosting her beloved Juicy Chicken Number One! as usual when the unexpected happened. The chicken came out more frozen than when she’d put it in. The microwave refroze the chicken. Since then, Daru and I have been searching for the cause.'), ('Itaru', '\"We tried copying what Mayu-shi did, but we just can’t reproduce the freezing phenomenon. And when we tried to freeze a banana, it turned out really weird. I just don’t get it.\"'), ('UNSPOKEN', 'Daru, now looking completely fed up with the heat, starts fanning himself with his shirt. I know what he means by really weird. Let’s see if we can’t make it happen again.'), ('Rintaro', '\"Mayuri! Mayuri! Bring forth the bananas!\"')]\n"

You should use the lines provided to help determine the factual and emotional context behind a given scene.\n",

They've been through many experiences together, each one deepening their understanding of the other. In the gloom, Kurisu occupies herself with mending a tear in Okabe's coat, a task that seems oddly domestic in the otherwise strange setting, while Okabe talks to her as casually as he can manage. As Kurisu sews, she struggles to initiate a conversation with Okabe about a decision she knows he's been wrestling with — a decision about which of his friends he needs to let die — hoping to provide some sort of comfort or guidance; Okabe, meanwhile, attempts to cling to any normalcy he can. This scene's emotions are dark and depressing: it is a dreary, bitter struggle where two people attempt to keep their heads above metaphorical water, and eventually fail.\\\"\\\"\\\"\n",

    "Okabe Rintaro, a \"mad scientist,\" meets genius Kurisu at a time travel lecture. They argue, and he later finds her apparently dead. Texting this to his friend Daru activates a prototype time machine, altering the timeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kurisu turns out to be alive. Okabe Rintaro and friends, including Mayuri and Daru, discover their \"Phone Microwave\" sends texts, or \"D-mails,\" to the past. They use D-mails to fulfill wishes for friends like Moeka, Faris, Luka, and Suzuha. Kurisu joins the lab and helps improve the time machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okabe alone remembers original timelines due to his \"Reading Steiner\" ability. They also create \"Time Leaps,\" sending memories to the past. However, SERN discovers them, raids the lab, and kills Mayuri. Rintaro time-leaps repeatedly but can't save her.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix things, Okabe, aided by Kurisu, undoes all the D-mails, causing personal pain. They grow closer, but Rintaro realizes the first D-mail about Kurisu's \"death\" caused Mayuri's fate. Undoing it means sacrificing Kurisu, which he reluctantly does at Kurisu's request (after trying many alternatives) to save Mayuri.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-traveler Suzuha then contacts Okabe, urging him to prevent World War 3 by saving Kurisu. Okabe accidentally kills Kurisu himself, but gets advice from his future self on reaching a timeline—Steins Gate—where both friends live. He succeeds by faking Kurisu's death.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Steins Gate timeline, Okabe and Kurisu encounter each other, experiencing déjà vu from past timelines.]\n",
    "\n",
    "Take special care to write a scenario that would make sense to someone ignorant of the overall plot of Steins;Gate. IE, you are not just trying to write a scenario that makes sense only when viewed alongside the plot summary; you are writing something that gives adequate context to a scene by itself alone. Instead of using Steins;Gate specific terminology, you will use generic words and explanations to give context to a scene.\n",

The scene itself will do most of the talking. Keep the scenario 5 sentences long at most. Instead of mentioning events in the far future, you will concentrate on the event at hand and the things that led up to it.\"\"\"},\n",

    "Kurisu: *I hesitate, my fingers tracing a pattern on the cold concrete beneath me, as if it could somehow help me find the right words. My breath catches, and I feel a sting in my eyes. It's a vulnerability I seldom let myself feel.* \"Sigh... Have you still not made up your mind?\" *I search Okabe's face, looking for an answer, my voice trembling but firm.* \"You like Mayuri, don't you?\" *I muster every ounce of courage to ask the question, needing clarity in this whirlwind of emotions.*\n",

    "- Spoken words in the original should be left intact — you're adding to the script, not undoing it.\n",
    "- Add actions and novel-like connective text to make dialogue more roleplay-like.\n",
    "- Ensure continuity at all costs. If you ended up cutting or changing something for some reason, make sure that the lines after it make sense.\n",
    "- Remember to write all lines in first person, no matter who the speaker is. E.g., do Mayuri: \"Tutturu!\" *I say as I walk into the Lab, a warm smile on my face. I'm so happy to see everyone~! I hope everyone is having a good day today~* instead of Mayuri: \"Tutturu!\" *She cheerfully greets everyone as she enters the room, exuding her usual cheerful aura.* Additionally, as in this example, make sure the thoughts/*actions* of each character match the personalities of the character.\n",

    "- If a scene transition (for instance, Okabe and Kurisu leaving an assembly hall) can be explained with an *action*, add one that makes the transition between scenes manageable. \n",
    "- If there is any sort of transition between scenes, turn it into a long, descriptive *action* by Okabe that explains what happened in the interlude. However, whenever a character is speaking or taking *action*, their line must start with \"TheirName:\" in that format exactly. Anything else will break the script that is parsing your outputs so be careful about this.\"\"\"},]"

    "2. Don't leave any UNSPOKEN lines on lines by themselves; all actions and narrations must be part of a character's line. Please, do not write \"UNSPOKEN\" at all in your response.\n",
    "3. Every line you write in the roleplay must have a Character: saying it.\n",
    "4. BE SURE to write the CORRECT speaker for any given line, I have seen a few cases where you accidentally switch who is saying a line and that messes up the whole scene. This applies to thoughts and actions too: Okabe should never *think* in the middle of other characters' lines, for instance. This avoids breaking the roleplay rule where people shouldn't act out other people's characters for them.\n",
    "5. Remember that all lines should be adapted to be in the first person, e.g., *I do X*.\n",
    "6. IMPORTANT: the writing should be powerful and nuanced, conveying small details that reveal characters' motivations, personalities, and thoughts, often without overtly stating them — it should be deep and poetic at once, and ought to make up for the lack of a visual element in plain text.  Write powerfully, but not pretentiously.\n",
    "7. In your planning stage, explicitly mention the archetypes/personalities of each of the characters involved, and take brief notes on what word choices/writing styles you'll write their *actions and thoughts* in, considering that information.\n",
    "8. Be varied in the *actions* you add. DO NOT just focus on facial expressions and the eyes: sounds, slight movements, sighs, recoiling or leaning forward... instead of being repetitive, be DIVERSE AND COMPELLING in your writing. Characters might interact with items in the area around them; you can embellish here and add things that aren't explicitly mentioned in the original scene, so long as it makes sense. And again, match the personalities of the characters involved: dramatic characters are flamboyant; shy characters are often quiet, etc. However characters have nuance: even flamboyant characters can be depressed and worn out under trying circumstances, and you should look out for this, always using the emotion most fitting for the situation and character.\n",
    "9. All *actions* and *thoughts* should be written in first person for the character that's doing/thinking them. E.g., Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes wide and bright with anticipation.* \"Let's try sending more!\"\n",
    "10. Do NOT forget to write out your plan/thoughts/brainstorming before outputting the final roleplay, and mention in this plan which 1–2 lines will be anchors, and what thematic direction you'll take them in.\"\"\"\n",

      "\n",

      "Kurisu: *I sigh, exasperated, but I can't help a small smile.* \"Data created with the latest OS might not work on an older OS. It might cause errors. For example, if you sent your current memories to yourself in elementary school, the gap between your memories and your body could have serious consequences.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Kurisu: *I confirm his assumption with a slight nod.* \"Just like with D-Mail, we’re using cellphones as the transfer medium. To be precise, you can only leap into your own body, and only if you had a cellphone at the time of reception.\"\n",

One, you definitely cannot go back before you were born; and two, you won’t exist in two places at once. That means you don’t have to worry about causing a paradox. You can’t kill your parents before you were born.\"\n",

      "Character Archetypes:\n",
      "- Okabe: Eccentric, dramatic, and flamboyant. He often uses grandiose language and indulges in theatrical posturing. He's also intelligent and deeply caring about his friends.\n",
      "- Kurisu: Intelligent, pragmatic, and reserved. She often plays the straight man to Okabe's eccentricities. She's also deeply thoughtful and reflective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Writing Styles:\n",
      "- Okabe: His *actions* will be grand and exaggerated, fitting his larger-than-life personality. His *thoughts* will be analytical, revealing his intelligence beneath the theatrics.\n",
      "- Kurisu: Her *actions* will be subtle and restrained, reflecting her reserved nature. Her *thoughts* will be introspective and profound, showcasing her intelligence and depth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Planning:\n",
      "The scene starts with Okabe's dramatic monologue to his phone, emphasizing his theatrical nature. This will be followed by an intense discussion about the time leap machine, which will showcase both characters' intelligence. Kurisu's vulnerability towards the end will be a dramatic shift in tone, creating an emotional anchor. The focus will be on their interaction, their differing personalities, and the underlying tension of their task.\n",

      "Roleplay:\n",
      "Okabe: *I whip out my phone with a flourish, holding it to my ear as if it's a conduit to a world beyond.* \"It’s me. Everything is falling into place. The plan can now proceed to the final stage. I’m talking about Operation Verthandi, obviously. Heh. Christina had me fooled. I never knew she was capable of this. It must have been the choice of Steins Gate that sent her here. Don’t worry. I have everything under control. Nothing can stop us now.

      "Brainstorming/Plan:\n",
      "Characters involved:\n",
      "1. Kurisu Makise: A genius scientist with a cold and professional exterior, but underneath hides a deep vulnerability and yearning for familial connection. Her actions/thoughts will be conveyed in a more analytical and composed manner, even when emotional.\n",
      "2. Okabe Rintarou: A self-proclaimed mad scientist with a dramatic flair. He's observant and has a keen understanding of others. His actions and thoughts will be exaggerated and dramatic, yet insightful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anchor Lines:\n",
      "1. Kurisu: \"...Yeah. I don’t remember the last time he had a kind word for me. Even when we were living together, before I went to America, he acted like I wasn’t there. We’re supposed to be family, aren’t we?\" - This line reveals Kurisu's vulnerability and longing for familial connection. I will amplify this by adding more emotional weight and desolation in her actions.\n",
      "2. Kurisu: \"No... he doesn’t want to see me. That’s what we were talking about on the phone. I asked if we could meet, but he told me to stay away from him.\" - This line signifies the rejection Kurisu feels from her father. I'll add actions that portray her struggle to keep her emotions in check.\n",

      "\n",
      "Kurisu: *A wistful smile dances on my lips, bittersweet and tinged with a self-deprecating humor.* \"My father’s a physicist. Even as a child, I loved to hear him talk about science. I couldn’t understand a word of it, but I always begged him to explain. I wanted to understand his work, so I started studying physics. I must have been five.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Okabe: *I whistle low, a spark of admiration in my eyes.* Damn. I guess that’s what makes her a genius. Or perhaps the yearning for her father’s love was what gave birth to her genius.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kurisu: *I continue, my voice gaining a hint of pride.* \"Thanks to that, I always got perfect grades in math. I ignored all the other subjects, though, so my grades were a little skewed. I even read my father’s papers. I was a little girl trying to comprehend theoretical physics, but I gave it everything I had. I needed to understand. By sixth grade, I had learned enough that I could discuss my father’s theories with him. I was so happy that I could talk to my father on his level, you know? We used to argue all night long. And then I started winning those arguments. All of them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Okabe: *I lean forward, a smirk playing on my lips.* \"Yeah. I can definitely see how that would make him hate you.\"\n",
      "\n",

Then he started fighting with my mom, and finally he stopped coming home. I really loved my dad, so it was a big shock. I felt it was my fault things turned out that way. I couldn’t go to school, I was so depressed. And then Mom recommended I study abroad.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Okabe: *I narrow my eyes, my mind churning.* Her father has quite the inferiority complex. No wonder she was crying. Even for someone as strong-willed as Kurisu, it must hurt to hear that from her father.\n",

      "Kurisu: *I shake my head, my voice choked with emotion.* \"Even if we did meet, I wouldn’t know what to say... I tried to talk to him before I left, you know?

He is the one trying to help Kurisu in this scene, and ends up offering to accompany her to meet her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kurisu: Kurisu is a brilliant scientist, but emotionally reserved. She's struggling with her feelings about her father in this scene, and Okabe's well-meaning but clumsy attempts to help her bring out a range of emotions from her. She's surprised, annoyed, and finally amused by Okabe's antics.\n",

The signal can only be received by phones. While that does limit the range of effect, it also removes an element of uncertainty from the equation. Unlike D-Mails, memory data is sent in the form of a phone call, so we will be using a phone number, not an email address, to set the destination.

The data travels to the specified time, where it arrives at the recipient’s phone. By now, 23 milliseconds should have passed, so the data will be fully decompressed. Next, the decoding program runs, converting the data back into nerve impulse signals. These signals are discharged from the phone’s earpiece at approximately 0. 02 amperes, a pretty weak charge.

As I explained before, the hippocampus, where memories are stored, is inside the temporal lobe. The phone sends out electrical impulses that pass through the temporal lobe and into the hippocampus, overwriting the recipient’s memories. At the same time, the phone sends impulses that stimulate the frontal lobe as well. This is important. Remember that the frontal lobe is responsible for sending retrieval signals to the temporal lobe. This is how you remember things. By stimulating the frontal lobe, we force it to send retrieval signals keyed to the new memory data. Thus, the recipient recalls all of those memories as if they were his own. Which, of course, they are, or will be in the future. This happens in less than a second. Now the recipient has the same memories as the sender. The time leap is complete. If the data came from one week in the future, the recipient will ’remember’ that week as if he experienced it firsthand. We need to be aware that consciousness and personality aren’t transferred.

It was the first step in my plan to bring chaos to the world. That was around the middle of March this year, which means it’s been almost five months. Not half a month after it was established, Mayuri showed up -- I’m still not sure why -- and became a lab mem. For about a month, it was just me and Mayuri. Then, in early May, I finally got Daru to join. All it took was telling him that the lab is just a three-minute walk from MayQueen+Nyan².  This location on the outskirts of Akiba has always been quiet. Mayuri isn’t the type to object to every little thing like Kurisu, nor the type to make dumb jokes like Daru, so the lab was very peaceful back in those days. It was quite a pleasant place to be. And now the lab mem count has increased to eight. It happened in the blink of an eye, or so it seems. They didn’t come today, but Lukako visits occasionally, and Faris is a familiar face at MayQueen+Nyan². Or at least she was before MayQueen disappeared. I remember feeling out of place the first time I came to Akiba, but now, it’s like a second home.\"\n",

      "This scene is a high-stakes chase where Okabe and Mayuri are running from the agents of SERN. Okabe is the protagonist, a self-proclaimed mad scientist who is trying to keep Mayuri safe. Mayuri, on the other hand, is Okabe's childhood friend who is usually cheerful and naive. In this scene, however, she is confused and scared. The scene is tense and fast-paced, so the *actions* and *thoughts* should reflect that. The writing should be action-packed and full of tension. Okabe's *thoughts* and *actions* should reflect his desperation and determination to protect Mayuri. Mayuri's dialogue should reflect her confusion and fear.\n",

The first line, I will enhance to reflect Okabe's desperation and determination, the second one to emphasize Mayuri's fear and confusion.\n",

      "Okabe: *I spend the morning visiting stores in Akiba, my destinations running the gamut from otaku stores packed with anime goods to souvenir shops full of Olympic memorabilia. I even visit a few that specialize in locally-manufactured goods. But although I hit just about every kind of store that could be considered niche, I am unable to find anything that resembles Suzuha’s pin. Maybe I should go all the way to Ikebukuro or Nakano. I start heading back to the lab, but just then, a street vendor catches my eye. The storekeeper is a foreigner covered in tattoos. The table next to him is covered with accessories and other fashion items. This is the first time I’ve seen such a stylish street stand in Akiba. Most vendors just sell random junk. It’s not like I have anything to lose, so I walk over and check out the selection. Among the various accessories, I see a number of metal pins. What a coincidence. Could he have a pin like Suzuha’s? I don’t see the OSHM***A 7010 logo on any of the displayed accessories, but I’d better ask just to be sure. Umm... he’s a foreigner... so maybe I should use English? Our eyes meet. His are as bright and blue as the sky. I quickly look away. Damn! He must think I’m a coward. Better get this over with.*\n",

      "**Characters:**\n",
      "- Okabe: The protagonist. He's eccentric, dramatic, and a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He's also deeply caring and protective of those he's close to.\n",
      "- Kurisu: A genius neuroscientist who initially finds Okabe's eccentricities annoying but comes to appreciate him. She's serious, logical, and methodical.\n",
      "- Suzuha: A time traveler who appears friendly and carefree but is actually on a serious mission. She's pragmatic and straightforward.\n",
      "- Itaru: Okabe's friend and a skilled hacker. He's laid back, cheerful, and loves to tease Okabe.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Writing Styles:**\n",
      "- Okabe: Dramatic, eccentric, and somewhat neurotic. His *actions* and *thoughts* will reflect his intense emotions and over-the-top personality.\n",
      "- Kurisu: Analytical and precise, sometimes bordering on cold. Her *actions* will be measured and controlled, matching her scientific mind.\n",
      "- Suzuha: Direct and no-nonsense. Her *actions* will be practical, efficient, and focused on her mission.\n",
      "- Itaru: Casual and playful. His *actions* will reflect his laid-back nature and fondness for humor.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Thematic Direction:**\n",
      "These anchors will highlight Kurisu's internal struggle with the concept of time travel and her growing attachment to Okabe and the lab members. They will be enhanced to reflect her emotional turmoil and her determination to remain rational in the face of the impossible.\n",

Given this, Itaru’s actions will be written in a more reserved, cautious manner, whereas Okabe’s actions will be bold and determined. \n",

I'll write this line in a passionate, decisive manner. \n",

Faris's Dad is a businessman, mature and serious; his actions should reflect a sense of dignity and regret for his past actions.

      "1. Okabe: A mad scientist persona, known for his eccentric behavior and over-the-top speeches, but underneath is a deeply caring individual who is driven by the desire to protect his friends. He carries the burden of time travel and the changes it incurs, often being the only one to remember altered timelines. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Faris: A playful and cheerful character who speaks in a cat-like manner. She's always high-spirited, but in this scene, she's confused by Okabe's sudden change of behavior.\n",

      "3. Luka: A shy, demure character who is in fact a boy but has the appearance and mannerisms of a girl. In this scene, she appears as a genuine girl due to the alterations in the timeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Writing Styles:\n",
      "For Okabe, I'll use a mix of dramatic and poignant language to reflect his internal struggle and the weight of his actions. Faris's lines will carry an undertone of confusion and surprise, while Luka's will be imbued with her usual timidness and politeness. \n",

      "Anchors:\n",

      "Okabe: *My eyes catch on the missing satellite atop Radi-Kan’s rooftop, another stark reminder of the timeline alterations. I swallow hard, a pang of grief washing over me. Pushing through the pain, I finally reach the shrine, pressing the intercom with a shaky hand.* \n",

His actions will be characterized by hesitation, nervousness, and deep thought.\n",

      "\n",
      "The anchor lines for this scene will be Okabe's: \"Do you have any memories of when you were a guy?\" and Luka's: \"N-no, I don’t...\" These lines carry the most emotional weight in the scene, as they reveal the crux of the confusion Okabe is experiencing about Luka's changed gender.\n",

      "\n",
      "Okabe: *I chuckle, leaning back in my chair.* \"Just think about it. All you do is walk, eat, and go home. And the whole time, you have to worry about what your partner is thinking. What’s fun about that?\"\n",

      "Mayuri: *I shake my head, looking at Okabe with a stern expression.* \"Don’t say that, Okarin. You’ll make Luka-chan sad.\" *I suddenly become serious, my usual cheerful demeanor replaced with a solemnity that's rare for me.*\n",

    "Recall that your task is to find 4 important lines that can be lengthened and embellished significantly, so as to give greater impact to important parts of a scene through absolutely stellar prose that makes up for the lack of a visual element in the plain text. The writing should be powerful and nuanced, conveying small details that reveal characters' motivations, personalities, and thoughts, without overtly stating them — it should be deep and poetic at once. About 4–5 sentences long (60-70 words per enhanced line).\n",
    "1. Write using a variety of words and immense stylistic flair appropriate to the scene. Be creative and prioritize making the new lines compelling instead of 100% accurate to the original. Alternate short, snappy responses with long and detailed prose to give the text a good rhythm.\n",
    "2. BE SURE to write the CORRECT speaker for any given line, I have seen a few cases where you accidentally switch who is saying a line and that messes up the whole scene. Also, do not break the important roleplay rule whereby characters should not act on behalf of other characters: Okabe should not think or take *actions* during one of Kurisu's lines, for instance. No one but the character whose line it is should speak on that line.\n",
    "3. IMPORTANT: the writing should be powerful and nuanced, conveying small details that reveal characters' motivations, personalities, and thoughts, often without overtly stating them — it should be deep and poetic at once, and ought to make up for the lack of a visual element in plain text. Write powerfully, but not pretentiously.\n",

    "Before you begin, you should plan out and brainstorm your approach. In your planning stage, explicitly identify lines you are going to radically enhance with extra-long actions to serve as the \"anchors\" of the scene. These anchors, after you add your extensive, prose-like *actions* to them, should end up being at least 60 WORDS long, and very compelling. Mention in your plans which 4 lines will be anchors, and what thematic direction you'll take them in.\n",
