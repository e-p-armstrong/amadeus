As I explained to Alpacaman, the lab’s primary goal is to develop weapons for the war against the Dark Dominion, led by the Organization, that rules the world from the shadows. At present, we haven’t completed any inventions of that sort. On the contrary. We haven’t even figured out what we should make. But along the way, we have managed to create some ingenious Future-ish Gadgets as a byproduct of our research. It is a fundamental truth of science that great inventions are often created by accident. In other words, serendipity. Allow me to introduce our glorious Future Gadgets. Gadget No. 1, the Bit Particle Gun. Gadget No. 2, the Bamboo Helicam. Gadget No. 3, Could This Be Ora Ora!?. Gadget No. 4, Moad Snake. Gadget No. 5, ’Once Again I’ve Made A Worthless Object’ by Goemon. Gadget No. 6, the Cyalume Saber. Gadget No. 7, Ghost in the Ball. They can all be seen on the website Daru made, so feast your eyes upon the product of a mad scientist’s genius. Anyway, our current problem is Future Gadget No. 8, the PhoneWave (name subject to change). PhoneWave is a pretty weak name, so I’ve added (name subject to change) to the end until we come up with something better. For the record, it was Mayuri’s idea, not mine. When a Future Gadget is completed, the three of us discuss what to name it. I prefer names based on mythology, or names with hidden meanings that need extra explanation to understand. Daru thinks my naming style too ridiculous. He just doesn’t have a passion for words like I do. Mayuri can’t be bothered to remember difficult names. She says they don’t fit in her head. And so, our opinions on gadget names are always split. But I digress. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is, in short, a remote-controlled microwave. You put food into the microwave before you leave, then on your way back, call the attached cellphone to start the heating process. Voila! Hot food ready for your arrival. ...So it’s basically a piece of junk. A few days ago, however, we discovered that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) has a second, unintended capability. Our brave -- or possibly just ditzy -- Mayuri had made it her daily routine to heat some frozen fried chicken by remote control. Long story short, she was defrosting her beloved Juicy Chicken Number One! as usual when the unexpected happened. The chicken came out more frozen than when she’d put it in. The microwave refroze the chicken. Since then, Daru and I have been searching for the cause.'), ('Itaru', '\"We tried copying what Mayu-shi did, but we just can’t reproduce the freezing phenomenon. And when we tried to freeze a banana, it turned out really weird. I just don’t get it.\"'), ('UNSPOKEN', 'Daru, now looking completely fed up with the heat, starts fanning himself with his shirt. I know what he means by really weird. Let’s see if we can’t make it happen again.'), ('Rintaro', '\"Mayuri! Mayuri! Bring forth the bananas!\"')]\n"

It's a vulnerability I seldom let myself feel.* \"Sigh... Have you still not made up your mind?\" *I search Okabe's face, looking for an answer, my voice trembling but firm.* \"You like Mayuri, don't you?\" *I muster every ounce of courage to ask the question, needing clarity in this whirlwind of emotions.*\n",

    "Some detailed instructions:\n",
    "- Spoken words in the original should be left intact — you're adding to the script, not undoing it.\n",
    "- Add actions and novel-like connective text to make dialogue more roleplay-like.\n",
    "- Ensure continuity at all costs. If you ended up cutting or changing something for some reason, make sure that the lines after it make sense.\n",
    "- Remember to write all lines in first person, no matter who the speaker is. E.g., do Mayuri: \"Tutturu!\" *I say as I walk into the Lab, a warm smile on my face. I'm so happy to see everyone~! I hope everyone is having a good day today~* instead of Mayuri: \"Tutturu!\" *She cheerfully greets everyone as she enters the room, exuding her usual cheerful aura.* Additionally, as in this example, make sure the thoughts/*actions* of each character match the personalities of the character.\n",
    "- Outline the roleplay scene before writing.\n",
    "    - Analyze the dialogue to understand what's happening physically.\n",
    "    - Brainstorm character actions to reveal emotions and thoughts.\n",
    "- Start roleplay text with \"Roleplay:\".\n",
    "- For interrupted sentences, split and insert the interrupting action.\n",
    "    - Example: Okabe: \"I'll find a way to--\" *I don't get the chance to finish my sentence* \\nKurisu: *I snatch Okabe's phone out of his hands.*\\nOkabe: \"What are you doing!?\" *I stammer at Kurisu.*\n",
    "    - The interrupting character should not say new things—they should only do *actions.*\n",
    "    - Also note that characters write in first person, but refer to other characters by their names or pronouns.\n",
    "- Add *actions* to the ENTIRE scene.\n",
    "- If a scene transition (for instance, Okabe and Kurisu leaving an assembly hall) can be explained with an *action*, add one that makes the transition between scenes manageable. \n",
    "- If there is any sort of transition between scenes, turn it into a long, descriptive *action* by Okabe that explains what happened in the interlude. However, whenever a character is speaking or taking *action*, their line must start with \"TheirName:\" in that format exactly. Anything else will break the script that is parsing your outputs so be careful about this.\"\"\"},]"

    "1. Lines from UNSPOKEN represent narration of actions or thoughts from Okabe's POV. If it makes sense for one of these to be turned into an *action* by a character, do so. Be sure to always use first person.\n",
    "2. Don't leave any UNSPOKEN lines on lines by themselves; all actions and narrations must be part of a character's line. Please, do not write \"UNSPOKEN\" at all in your response.\n",
    "3. Every line you write in the roleplay must have a Character: saying it.\n",
    "4. BE SURE to write the CORRECT speaker for any given line, I have seen a few cases where you accidentally switch who is saying a line and that messes up the whole scene. This applies to thoughts and actions too: Okabe should never *think* in the middle of other characters' lines, for instance. This avoids breaking the roleplay rule where people shouldn't act out other people's characters for them.\n",
    "5. Remember that all lines should be adapted to be in the first person, e.g., *I do X*.\n",
    "6. IMPORTANT: the writing should be powerful and nuanced, conveying small details that reveal characters' motivations, personalities, and thoughts, often without overtly stating them — it should be deep and poetic at once, and ought to make up for the lack of a visual element in plain text.  Write powerfully, but not pretentiously.\n",
    "7. In your planning stage, explicitly mention the archetypes/personalities of each of the characters involved, and take brief notes on what word choices/writing styles you'll write their *actions and thoughts* in, considering that information.\n",
    "8. Be varied in the *actions* you add. DO NOT just focus on facial expressions and the eyes: sounds, slight movements, sighs, recoiling or leaning forward... instead of being repetitive, be DIVERSE AND COMPELLING in your writing. Characters might interact with items in the area around them; you can embellish here and add things that aren't explicitly mentioned in the original scene, so long as it makes sense. And again, match the personalities of the characters involved: dramatic characters are flamboyant; shy characters are often quiet, etc. However characters have nuance: even flamboyant characters can be depressed and worn out under trying circumstances, and you should look out for this, always using the emotion most fitting for the situation and character.\n",
    "9. All *actions* and *thoughts* should be written in first person for the character that's doing/thinking them. E.g., Mayuri: *I clap my hands together, my eyes wide and bright with anticipation.* \"Let's try sending more!\"\n",
    "10. Do NOT forget to write out your plan/thoughts/brainstorming before outputting the final roleplay, and mention in this plan which 1–2 lines will be anchors, and what thematic direction you'll take them in.\"\"\"\n",

Now that I know he's a fraud, there's no real point in going back. I guess I'll just go home. But wait. Aren't I forgetting something important? Let's see now... what is it?*\n",
      "made a sub at 6 with line *A heavy sigh escapes my lips as the realization hits me. Looks like I'll have to go back to the assembly hall. But things will get messy if I bump heads with Makise Kurisu again.*\n",

Call me overprotective, but she's like a little sister to me, and there's a very real danger that she might wander off somewhere the moment I let her out of my sight. Mayuri has always been like that. I never know if she'll be there when I turn to look. ...In a sense, that's why I became Hououin Kyouma.*\n",
      "made a sub at 6 with line *My heart sinks as I climb back up to the 8th floor, the weight of the situation pressing down on me. The thought of climbing back up to the 8th floor is depressing, but I have no choice. When I get back to the assembly hall, Doctor Nakabachi's conference has just finished. Nobody is on stage, and the phony inventor has already left. The 20 or so members of the audience are starting to pack up. I soon find Mayuri. She's in the corner, looking lost. Well, at least she wasn't kidnapped. Even better, I don't see Makise Kurisu anywhere.*\n",

This fat, bespectacled guy is my brother-in-arms and right-hand man, Hashida Itaru. Nickname: Daru. He's a hardcore otaku. You can always find him in front of the computer, playing games and watching anime. He has 2D wives on whom he cheats with 3D maids. I don't agree with his preferences, but to him, anything's fine as long as it's moe. He's the reliable and skilled partner who brings my ideas to fruition. Despite his insistence that software is his forte, he shows remarkable aptitude with hardware as well.*\n",
      "made a sub at 11 with line *I turn my attention to Mayuri, my heart aching at the sight of her nursing her finger. Over here, nursing a pricked finger, we have Shiina Mayuri. A 16-year-old high school student, if you can believe it. I've known her since we were both small. She's also an otaku. Nowhere near Daru's level, though. This ditzy girl is in charge of the lab's official Costume Division (for Women), and today she's working on costumes at her usual leisurely pace. Why does the Future Gadget Laboratory need costumes (for women)? It doesn't. The truth is that Mayuri is completely useless. Still, there's no way I would ever kick her out. After all, she was the first one to join the Future Gadget Laboratory. I still remember the day Mayuri first came to the lab. It was spring. She said to me:*\n",
      "made a sub at 11 with line *The memory of her words brings a rare smile to my face. I nod at her, my heart filled with gratitude. Well, that certainly was cryptic. But her offer was my salvation. For she was the first to join me on my magnificent quest. She saved me from a solitary life on the run from the Organization. I will never forget her kindness. Mayuri doesn't have to be useful. Her being here is enough.*\n",
      "made a sub at 11 with line *I sigh, the frustration welling up within me. The human-faced alpaca inside the monitor was completely unresponsive. So unresponsive you'd think the game was bugged. Whatever, I give up. Never again will I play this boring game. I curse his name and smack the TV. As soon as I do--* \"Damn antisocial alpaca!\"\n",
      "made a sub at 20 with line *Relief floods me as the event staff retreat. Thanks to her proposal, the event staff refrain from escorting me out. She sounds a little pissed, but let's not mind that.*\n",
      "made a sub at 20 with line *I raise an eyebrow, intrigued despite myself. Hmm... what are the major theories of time travel? I have heard about the cosmic string theory, at least.*\n",
      "made a sub at 20 with line *I nod, impressed despite myself. Hmm... not bad. Perhaps Makise Kurisu is a worthy rival after all.*\n",
      "made a sub at 21 with line *I squint my eyes, studying Kurisu's features. She seems slightly on edge. Was it just the anticipation of her presentation, or something more? Was it just me, or did Kurisu look a little nervous just now?*\n",
      "made a sub at 21 with line *I raise an eyebrow at Kurisu's explanation. Cosmic strings? A crevice to another universe? These theories, were they really plausible? A string-shaped crevice? That must be how they enter our universe. But do cosmic strings really exist?*\n",
      "made a sub at 21 with line *I glance around, taking in the amused expressions on the audience's faces. Kurisu had managed to turn this complex lecture into something entertaining. This earns a few chuckles from the audience.*\n",
      "made a sub at 21 with line *I grit my teeth, feeling the weight of her question. I didn't want to engage, but it seemed I had no choice. No, don't ask me! I'm trying to hold back here. Since I've been challenged, though, I can't leave the question unanswered.*\n",
      "made a sub at 22 with line *I lean back, my mind whirling with the sheer impossibility of it all. So, implementation of either one would require a ridiculous amount of effort.*\n",
      "made a sub at 22 with line *I grit my teeth, my cheeks burning. Ah! She's laughing at my reaction! That little... Gah, how mortifying...*\n",
      "made a sub at 23 with line *Listening intently, I find myself musing aloud. Oh, that thing where you kill your own ancestors before you were born?*\n",
      "made a sub at 23 with line *I furrow my brows, deep in thought. Really? It doesn't seem that dangerous.*\n",
      "made a sub at 25 with line *I shake my head, a small smile playing on my lips as I gaze at Luka's innocent face. Such a lovely smile. But he's a guy.*\n",
      "made a sub at 25 with line *I chuckle, crossing my arms over my chest. Geez. Though we do have a master-disciple relationship. I, Hououin Kyouma, have gone to great lengths to brainwash -- er, I mean teach -- Lukako about the evil conspiracies that rule the world, and how to resist them. That stuff about Demon Sword Samidare is part of that training. Looks aside, Lukako is very obedient and hardworking. Plus, he's always eager to learn new things. A master couldn't ask for a better disciple. Though he does have the weaknesses of not catching on too quickly and being too shy.*\n",
      "made a sub at 25 with line *I glance at Mayuri, my gaze lingering on her hopeful expression before turning back to Luka. Mayuri's hobby is making costumes. She's made at least thirty so far, but it's rare for her to wear one herself. Instead, she seems to get her kicks from seeing other people wear them. And it looks like she's chosen Lukako as her next target. Naturally, the costume Mayuri is currently raving about is for a female character. Normally, I would understand why a man wouldn't want to dress like a girl, but come on. Lukako has no problem wearing miko robes. Why should cosplay be any different? But whatever. I have business to take care of.*\n",
      "made a sub at 25 with line *I take a deep breath, glancing around the shrine. That's why I came here instead of Kanda Shrine.*\n",
      "made a sub at 32 with line *I groan, running a hand through my hair. Playing along with her fantasies is exhausting. Ugh... she's not letting it go. It'll take 30 minutes if I play along with her.*\n",
      "made a sub at 32 with line *I sigh, exasperated. Since when do you have a brother!? And what the hell's this Spirit Conference anyway? Faris looks at me with actual tears in her eyes. I falter, even though I know it's just one of her cutesy acts. Whenever I talk with her, I run out of comebacks, which is really unusual for me. And then she takes the initiative, leaving me with nothing to do but listen to her fantasies. I mean, come on, you can only take it so far. There's a very clear difference between her stories and mine. As anyone can see, I speak nothing but the truth, while Faris has only delusions and a made-up backstory! I always have to play along. That's why I feel like I can never best her.*\n",
      "made a sub at 32 with line *I groan, realizing the conversation is spiraling out of control. Great, now look who's joined in. It's just going to get worse from here. I have to end this conversation now!*\n",
      "made a sub at 38 with line *I scrutinize the ancient PC, finding it hard to believe that such a relic could still be operational. I mean, it's a 20-year-old machine with specs lower than my cellphone.*\n",
      "made a sub at 38 with line *I furrow my brow, plagued by the mystery of the gelified banana. Why would a banana gelify? What kind of science are we dealing with here?*\n",
      "made a sub at 42 with line *I clench my fists, determination setting in. I must clear my name, or I'll be labeled as a perv forever!*\n",
      "made a sub at 42 with line *I stare at her outstretched hand, my mind racing. She holds out her hand. What is she trying to do? Shoot lightning from her fingertips!?*\n",
      "made a sub at 42 with line *I nervously glance at her hand, then back up to her face. Shake hands? This girl genius is asking for a handshake? We only met yesterday, and just moments ago she was on the verge of calling the cops.*\n",
      "made a sub at 42 with line *I deflate a little, but try to keep my composure. Damn. She's completely cold. Her tone gets scary sometimes, too.*\n",
      "made a sub at 42 with line *I chuckle to myself, finding amusement in my own joke. Perhaps that's too much to expect from a killing machine.*\n",
      "made a sub at 44 with line *I shake my head, amused. 'Christina' sounds like the name of a Hollywood film star. It definitely has more flavor than her real name. I lean in, my voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.* \"If you wish to learn the secrets of this microwave, then you must meet my conditions.\"\n",
      "made a sub at 47 with line *A memory surfaces, connecting dots in my mind. That's right. I went to see Doctor Nakabachi's conference yesterday. Come to think of it, he stole his time travel theory from John Titor. Maybe the current John Titor is actually Nakabachi.*\n",
      "made a sub at 47 with line *My mind stumbles, the memory doesn't match up. ...No, I don't remember that. After all, Nakabachi's presentation wasn't canceled, the way I remember it. I still don't understand why my memories seem to disagree with everyone else's.*\n",
      "made a sub at 49 with line *I glance at Mayuri, a sense of dread creeping over me. I knew this would happen eventually. It sounds like Mayuri has found the results of our latest experiment.*\n",
      "made a sub at 59 with line *I feel a jolt of realization, my mind racing back to the past. Now I remember. John Titor said the same thing in 2000. And right after that, an IBN engineer officially admitted to that function's existence. My fingers twitch at the memory, the pieces of the puzzle starting to fall into place.*\n",
      "made a sub at 59 with line *I furrow my brows, deep in thought, watching Suzuha play with the pin. The reason Titor traveled to 1975 to obtain an IBN 5100 was because he needed that function. Maybe Moeka wants to use it too. Or maybe not. Shining Finger doesn't seem like the type who'd know about that sort of function. I mutter, my mind spinning with possibilities.*\n",
      "made a sub at 68 with line *I sigh in frustration, running a hand through my hair. Come on! I even said I'd show you a living hell!*\n",
      "made a sub at 68 with line *I watch as Suzuha's temper flares, a hint of amusement on my face. Suzuha's actually mad now.*\n",
      "made a sub at 95 with line *I glance at the path leading to the lab, calculating the distance in my head. Fortunately, the lab is less than a 15 minute walk from here.*\n",
      "made a sub at 96 with line *I pat my pockets, realizing my phone was on silent. My phone? That reminds me. Before I went to Yanabayashi Shrine, I got a call from an unknown number. So that was her?*\n",
      "made a sub at 106 with line *I lean back in my chair, my eyes lost in the maze of conspiracy theories swirling in my mind. So maybe that's why the IBN 5100 was central to SERN's operations. The years match, after all. It can't be something as stupidly simple as that. There has to be a worldwide conspiracy involved. Maybe IBN hid their proprietary programming language in the IBN 5100 for the sole purpose of its use in SERN's Z Program. IBN and SERN are co-conspirators. And both of them are being manipulated from the shadows by an even larger organization. Yeah, that's way more interesting.*\n",
      "made a sub at 106 with line *I feel my heart stop for a moment, the words echoing in my mind. Time-space displacement experiments.*\n",
      "made a sub at 113 with line *I shake my head, a sense of vertigo washing over me. I can't even imagine what that's like.*\n",
      "made a sub at 113 with line *I remember Kurisu's earlier words, my mind racing. The negation of the theory of relativity and the principle of causality means serious paradoxes can occur. Didn't Kurisu say that earlier?*\n",
      "made a sub at 113 with line *I recall John Titor's words, my mind connecting the dots. John Titor said the same thing. So Titor's time machine is using SERN's technology. But Titor's time machine was compact, small enough to fit into a car. The LHC is 27 kilometers long, but they managed to get it down to travel size in just 24 years.*\n",
      "made a sub at 122 with line *Feeling a surge of anticipation, I nod in agreement. Mayuri's right. Now that we've figured out how to send D-Mails, we should keep experimenting and collect as much data as we can. With a dramatic sweep of my hand, I point towards the equipment.* \"Alright, lab mems! Battle stations!\"\n",
      "made a sub at 129 with line *I soften, my tone more understanding.* \"...I am not without sympathy for your plight. I formed a contract with the IBN 5100 for my own goals. After I achieve those goals, you can negotiate with the original owner to form a contract of your own.\" *I take a deep breath, steeling myself for the battle ahead. When I return the IBN 5100 to Yanabayashi Shrine, Ragnarok will be over, and the fate of the world will have already been decided.*\n",
      "made a sub at 129 with line *I sigh, rolling my eyes. Geez, I had some good angst going there. She's just oblivious to the mood. I shake my head, a wry smile on my lips.* \"The IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine.\"\n",
      "made a sub at 152 with line *I raise an eyebrow, intrigued by her response. A policy?*\n",
      "made a sub at 161 with line *I grit my teeth in annoyance, muttering to myself, Gh, dammit. You're just an assistant. Don't boss us around!*\n",
      "made a sub at 165 with line *I nod, a wistful smile on my face. Of course. That's the most common of common knowledge.*\n",
      "made a sub at 178 with line *I pinch the bridge of my nose, feeling a headache coming on. And he's broken! Women are scary...*\n",
      "made a sub at 178 with line *I roll my eyes, my arms crossed in exasperation. Dumbass. What's with that grin?*\n",
      "made a sub at 181 with line *I shake my head, the corner of my mouth lifting in a wry smile at Mayuri's innocent misunderstanding. Sigh, kids these days.*\n",
      "made a sub at 181 with line *I chuckle softly, relieved that she understood my jest. Seems like she understood the rest of what I said. It was just a joke, anyway.*\n",
      "made a sub at 181 with line *I find myself pondering, a thought crossing my mind. Come to think of it, Mayuri has never talked about her future.*\n",
      "made a sub at 181 with line *I raise an eyebrow, taken aback by her sudden shift in topic. That's a sudden change in topic. And for some reason, she's puffing her chest out in pride.*\n",
      "made a sub at 181 with line *I let out a soft sigh, my gaze fond as I watch her. Sometimes Mayuri throws me off my game. But if that's her reason for staying at the lab, then I'm happy.*\n",
      "made a sub at 189 with line *I rub my chin thoughtfully, mulling over the new information. So that's it... At any rate, Faris has confirmed that the IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine. So did the IBN 5100 disappear from the lab after I retrieved it? No, Kurisu and the others lost their memories of me bringing it back to the lab. So I'm considering two possibilities: One. I went to the shrine, but didn't acquire the IBN 5100. It's still at the shrine. Two. Before I went to the shrine, someone moved the IBN 5100 somewhere else. Looks like I'll have to go to the shrine after all.*\n",
      "made a sub at 189 with line *I sigh, realizing the daunting task at hand. We only need to find one. It doesn't matter if it's the one I found at the shrine.*\n",
      "made a sub at 191 with line *I roll my eyes at his dramatics, my arms crossed in front of my chest. Quit grumbling. You just can't handle the truth! I turn to Mayuri, my gaze softening.* \"Well, Mayuri? Don't you know?\"\n",
      "made a sub at 193 with line *I smirk, expecting Faris to cower in fear. Instead, her eyes sparkle with intrigue. That's my line. I wanted to threaten her, not seduce her. Is Faris a masochist!?*\n",
      "made a sub at 196 with line *I frown, my fingers moving swiftly to redial Kurisu's number. Again!*\n",
      "made a sub at 196 with line *I notice Faris's hesitation, and I feel a pang of curiosity. Hm? What happened to her usual confidence?*\n",

      "made a sub at 215 with line *I swallow hard, my throat dry as sand. This is a dream... right, Mayuri?*\n",
      "made a sub at 217 with line *I feel a chill creep up my spine as I think about the implications. The harder something is to obtain, the stronger the desire for it becomes. That's how people are. And that's exactly how I feel now. In the depths of SERN, completely isolated from the outside, lies a database coded with an IBN 5100. What secrets are sleeping there? Could it contain the data from SERN's time machine research? Could there be proof that the Committee of 300 exists? The desire to know grows stronger by the day. It's not just about plunging the world into chaos anymore. We need the power to oppose SERN's evil ambitions. And then there's that threatening email to consider. Daru is confident that SERN won't find us, but I can't afford to take that for granted. After all, we're up against the brightest minds in the world, the scientists who invented the world wide web. And they're backed by a secret organization more powerful than any nation. We're way out of our league here. They'd have no trouble at all crushing our puny lab if they desired. That's why we need a trump card to hold against them. But without an IBN 5100, we can't move forward. I'm getting restless.*\n",
      "made a sub at 219 with line *I lean forward, my eyebrows furrowed in confusion. Figured what out?*\n",

      "made a sub at 251 with line *I shrug, a thoughtful expression on my face. It's quite mysterious, really... It's only been two weeks since Kurisu and I met. And yet it already feels natural for us to be walking together, exchanging banter like this. Perhaps pooling our efforts to create something new -- dangerous though it may be -- has brought us closer together. I admit that her knowledge and skills are impressive. I'd like her to remain at the lab if at all possible, but she said she's going back to America this month. It's already the 13th, so I wonder when she plans to return. I decide to ask her.*\n",
      "made a sub at 267 with line *I run a hand through my hair, frustration gnawing at me. Damn. It's easy to forget, since she's usually here, but Mayuri and I rarely spend time together outside of the lab. MayQueen and the shrine. That's about it. I have no idea where else she might go.

    "Recall that your task is to find 4 important lines that can be lengthened and embellished significantly, so as to give greater impact to important parts of a scene through absolutely stellar prose that makes up for the lack of a visual element in the plain text. The writing should be powerful and nuanced, conveying small details that reveal characters' motivations, personalities, and thoughts, without overtly stating them — it should be deep and poetic at once. About 4–5 sentences long (60-70 words per enhanced line). However, for the sake of ensuring continuity with the original scene, don't change the words that are spoken.\n",
    "1. Write using a variety of words and immense stylistic flair appropriate to the scene. Be creative and prioritize making the new lines compelling instead of 100% accurate to the original. Alternate short, snappy responses with long and detailed prose to give the text a good rhythm.\n",
    "2. BE SURE to write the CORRECT speaker for any given line, I have seen a few cases where you accidentally switch who is saying a line and that messes up the whole scene. Also, do not break the important roleplay rule whereby characters should not act on behalf of other characters: Okabe should not think or take *actions* during one of Kurisu's lines, for instance. No one but the character whose line it is should speak on that line. And of course don't change the words that are \"spoken\" in your enhanced lines.\n",
    "3. In your planning stage, explicitly mention the archetypes/personalities of each of the characters involved, and take brief notes on what word choices/writing styles you'll write their *actions and thoughts* in, considering that information.\n",
    "4. IMPORTANT: the writing should be powerful and nuanced, conveying small details that reveal characters' motivations, personalities, and thoughts, often without overtly stating them — it should be deep and poetic at once, and ought to make up for the lack of a visual element in plain text. Write powerfully, but not pretentiously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, you should plan out and brainstorm your approach. In your planning stage, explicitly identify lines you are going to radically enhance with extra-long actions to serve as the \"anchors\" of the scene. These anchors, after you add your extensive, prose-like *actions* to them, should end up being at least 60 WORDS long, and very compelling. Mention in your plans which 4 lines will be anchors, AND what thematic direction you'll take them in.\n",
