Having just discovered that Kurisu Makise is alive and well, Rintaro is paranoid and on edge, caught up in his delusions of an 'Organization' out to get him. The two are in a public area following a conference, with Kurisu puzzled and concerned by Rintaro's erratic behavior. She remembers a strange encounter with him before the conference started and is determined to find out why he was acting so peculiarly. At this point, Kurisu hardly knows Rintaro and is mostly confused and curious about his behavior. In the forthcoming conversation, she will be trying to dig deeper into Rintaro's oddities and understand why he seemed to know her before they officially met.
