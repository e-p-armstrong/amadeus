Plan:
1. The conversation takes place after Rintaro finds Kurisu alive and well following his discovery of her in a pool of blood and subsequent text to Daru that initiated a timeline shift. 
2. This conversation seems to occur in a public setting, possibly after the conference mentioned by Kurisu, where Rintaro is acting suspicious and Kurisu wants to clarify something with him.
3. Rintaro is acting paranoid, referring to an "Organization" and treating Kurisu as an enemy.
4. Kurisu is confused by Rintaro's behavior and wants to understand why he's acting as he is.
5. Kurisu's future actions will likely involve trying to figure out why Rintaro is behaving strangely and what he knows about her.

Scenario:
Having just discovered that Kurisu Makise is alive and well, Rintaro is paranoid and on edge, caught up in his delusions of an 'Organization' out to get him. The two are in a public area following a conference, with Kurisu puzzled and concerned by Rintaro's erratic behavior. She remembers a strange encounter with him before the conference started and is determined to find out why he was acting so peculiarly. At this point, Kurisu hardly knows Rintaro and is mostly confused and curious about his behavior. In the forthcoming conversation, she will be trying to dig deeper into Rintaro's oddities and understand why he seemed to know her before they officially met.
