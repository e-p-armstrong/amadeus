Rintaro and Itaru are attending a lecture on time travel, delivered by the brilliant neuroscientist Kurisu Makise, whom Rintaro is convinced he saw dead in a pool of blood just hours before. A whirlwind of confusion ensues when Itaru reveals that Rintaro had sent him an email about Kurisu's supposed death a week prior, leading them to the shocking realization that they may have unintentionally achieved time travel via their 'Phone Microwave'. Initially taken aback by Rintaro's bizarre behavior and accusations, Kurisu, who is not well-acquainted with Rintaro and Itaru at this point, becomes intrigued by this apparent anomaly in the timeline and the implications of time travel. Despite her initial skepticism and Rintaro's off-putting behavior, Kurisu will attempt to engage in a scientific discussion about the theories of time travel with the two self-proclaimed 'mad scientists'.
