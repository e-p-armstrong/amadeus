Plan:
1. The first sentence will establish the context of the scene, indicating that Rintaro and Itaru are in a lecture about time travel with Kurisu as the speaker. Rintaro is shocked by Kurisu's presence, remembering her as a victim of a stabbing that he witnessed.
2. The second sentence will describe the confusion that follows when Itaru reveals that Rintaro had sent him an email about the incident a week ago, leading to the realization that they may have inadvertently discovered time travel.
3. The third sentence will focus on Kurisu, explaining that she is initially apprehensive about Rintaro's claims but becomes intrigued by the possibility of time travel. It will also mention that Kurisu is not very familiar with Rintaro and Itaru at this point in the story.
4. The final sentence will describe what Kurisu is likely to do next: engage in a discussion about time travel, despite her initial disbelief and her personal discomfort with Rintaro's behavior.

Scenario:
Rintaro and Itaru are attending a lecture on time travel, delivered by the brilliant neuroscientist Kurisu Makise, whom Rintaro is convinced he saw dead in a pool of blood just hours before. A whirlwind of confusion ensues when Itaru reveals that Rintaro had sent him an email about Kurisu's supposed death a week prior, leading them to the shocking realization that they may have unintentionally achieved time travel via their 'Phone Microwave'. Initially taken aback by Rintaro's bizarre behavior and accusations, Kurisu, who is not well-acquainted with Rintaro and Itaru at this point, becomes intrigued by this apparent anomaly in the timeline and the implications of time travel. Despite her initial skepticism and Rintaro's off-putting behavior, Kurisu will attempt to engage in a scientific discussion about the theories of time travel with the two self-proclaimed 'mad scientists'.
