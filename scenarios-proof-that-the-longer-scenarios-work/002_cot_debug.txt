Plan:
1. Identify the location and the characters involved.
2. Describe the relationship between the characters and their current engagement.
3. Explain what Kurisu is trying to do and how she is feeling.

Scenario:
In the early stage of Steins;Gate, Kurisu is delivering a lecture on the theories of time travel, with Rintaro, another scientist, and a host of students in attendance at a university seminar room. Kurisu, a renowned scientist but a stranger to Rintaro and his lab members, is challenging the conventional wisdom of time travel, asserting her knowledge on the subject. As the lecture progresses, Kurisu, feeling both enthusiastic and slightly defensive, will delve further into the intricacies of theoretical time travel models, aiming to engage and perhaps even confound Rintaro with her deep understanding.
