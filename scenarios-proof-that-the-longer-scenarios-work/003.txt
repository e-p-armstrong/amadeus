 
Rintaro, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist," has come to a lecture hall to attend a talk on time travel theories given by Kurisu Makise, a renowned neuroscientist and physicist. This takes place shortly after their brief argument about the feasibility of time travel. Feeling challenged by Rintaro's presence, Kurisu is in the middle of explaining the complexity and near impossibility of time travel as we understand it, using wormholes as her main example. Though not very familiar with Rintaro or the other characters present, she is determined to assert her scientific expertise. Kurisu will continue to dissect the theories behind time travel and challenge the participants to think critically about the implications, all in her characteristic methodical, direct style.
