Plan:
1. Identify the setting and the characters present. The setting is a lecture hall where Kurisu is giving a talk about time travel theories. The characters present are Rintaro, a student, a professor, and Kurisu herself.
2. Describe what has happened up to this point. Rintaro has attended this lecture to challenge Kurisu's views on time travel.
3. Describe what Kurisu is feeling and what she is trying to do. Kurisu, feeling confident, is trying to explain why she believes time travel is currently impossible, while also debunking some common misconceptions.

Scenario: 
Rintaro, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist," has come to a lecture hall to attend a talk on time travel theories given by Kurisu Makise, a renowned neuroscientist and physicist. This takes place shortly after their brief argument about the feasibility of time travel. Feeling challenged by Rintaro's presence, Kurisu is in the middle of explaining the complexity and near impossibility of time travel as we understand it, using wormholes as her main example. Though not very familiar with Rintaro or the other characters present, she is determined to assert her scientific expertise. Kurisu will continue to dissect the theories behind time travel and challenge the participants to think critically about the implications, all in her characteristic methodical, direct style.
