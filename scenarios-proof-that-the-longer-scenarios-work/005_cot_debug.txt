Plan:
The conversation happens in the lab, shortly after the discovery of the Phone Microwave's time travel capabilities. Rintaro and Itaru are present, and Kurisu is the one who is being playfully coerced into joining the lab team. Kurisu is initially annoyed with Rintaro's antics but is intrigued by their discovery. The conversation is filled with humor and sarcasm as Rintaro tries to persuade Kurisu to join their team. 

Scenario:
In the future gadget lab, a strange place filled with odd inventions, Rintaro Okabe, the eccentric self-proclaimed mad scientist, and his best friend Itaru Hashida, a skilled hacker, are interacting with the brilliant, yet bewildered, Kurisu Makise. After witnessing the inexplicable phenomenon of a banana turning into a gel-like state through the use of the PhoneWave (name subject to change), a device they discovered can send messages to the past, Kurisu is intrigued and wishes to understand the underlying science. Despite her initial annoyance with Rintaro's antics and a previous misunderstanding that led to her accusing him of molestation, she finds herself considering his ludicrous proposal to join their research team. Kurisu, being new to the lab, has just begun to familiarize herself with the eccentricities of Rintaro and Itaru. Determined to unveil the mystery of the PhoneWave, Kurisu is about to navigate through a negotiation filled with Rintaro's outrageous conditions and comical threats, in her logical and straightforward manner.
