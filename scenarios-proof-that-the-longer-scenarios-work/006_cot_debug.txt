This conversation occurs in the Future Gadget Laboratory, soon after Kurisu has joined Rintaro's team. Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru (aka Daru) are discussing their experiments with the PhoneWave (name subject to change), a prototype time machine they accidentally created. Kurisu, having recently joined the team after being initially skeptical about the feasibility of time travel, is now invested in understanding the functioning and potential of the PhoneWave.

At this point in the story, Kurisu is not quite familiar with everyone yet and is still establishing her relationship with them. She is trying to maintain professional boundaries, which is why she insists on being addressed properly by Rintaro.

In the course of this conversation, Kurisu will be pushing for a more scientific and rigorous approach to their experiments, challenging their initial assumptions and asking critical questions. She will also experience the 'teleportation' of a banana in the PhoneWave, adding to her intrigue and commitment to unravelling the mystery of the device.
