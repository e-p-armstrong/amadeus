Okabe Rintaro, a self-proclaimed mad scientist who prefers the codename Hououin Kyouma, and his cheerful but naive friend Mayuri, find themselves in the assembly hall on the 8th floor of Radi-Kan, awaiting a press conference by the TV personality and inventor, Doctor Nakabachi. Despite Okabe's insistence on his codename, Mayuri continues to affectionately call him "Okarin," a nickname that he finds annoying. Okabe, who regularly indulges in fantasies of being hunted by a non-existent "Organization," harbors a degree of skepticism and suspicion towards Nakabachi's time machine claim, while Mayuri, oblivious to these nuances, is merely there because she followed Okabe. The absence of any reputable reporters or cameramen at the event baffles both of them, further fueling Okabe's suspicions. The mood of this scene is a blend of intrigue, anticipation, and mild frustration, as Okabe tries to reconcile the odd circumstances surrounding the press conference with his wild theories, and Mayuri, in her innocent confusion, attempts to comprehend the situation.
