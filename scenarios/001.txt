Rintaro and Kurisu find themselves in the Future Gadget Lab, with Rintaro in a state of shock and disbelief upon seeing Kurisu alive after he witnessed her supposed death. Rintaro confronts Kurisu about this, causing confusion and tension as he insists on her death while she stands right in front of him, unharmed. Kurisu, despite being taken aback by Rintaro's fervor, attempts to understand his perspective and the source of his apparent delusion. At this point, Kurisu is still largely unfamiliar with Rintaro and his eccentric tendencies, making his claims all the more perplexing. Moving forward, Kurisu intends to investigate Rintaro's claims and unravel the truth behind his seemingly impossible email about her own death.
