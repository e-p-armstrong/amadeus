Brainstorming: The scene appears to be set in the early stages of the story, during an event where Okabe and Mayuri have come to attend a press conference by another scientist, Dr. Nakabachi. The key characters in this scene are Okabe Rintaro and Mayuri, both of whom are friends and have a playful relationship. Okabe, who prefers to be called by his chosen name, Hououin Kyouma, has a dramatic flair and is characterized by his paranoia about a mysterious "Organization." Mayuri, on the other hand, is light-hearted and seemingly oblivious to Okabe's dramatics. They're currently in an assembly hall waiting for the press conference to start but notice that the expected crowd is surprisingly absent. This seems to be a common, non-threatening situation.

Scenario: Okabe and Mayuri, two friends with contrasting personalities, are standing in an empty assembly hall on the 8th floor of a building known as Radi-Kan, waiting for an inventor's press conference to start. Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is filled with excitement and paranoia, while Mayuri, his cheerful and carefree friend, is simply tagging along without understanding the purpose of their visit. The press conference they're attending is held by Dr. Nakabachi, a somewhat-known inventor who Okabe regards as a fellow rebel against a shadowy "Organization". However, the anticipated press conference seems off as there are no media personnel present, which sparks Okabe's suspicion. Okabe's goal is to understand what Dr. Nakabachi has to present, while Mayuri is simply following her friend's lead without much thought. The overall mood of the scene is a mix of mystery, humor, and anticipation.
