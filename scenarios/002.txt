 
Having just exited an elevator in a high-rise building, Kurisu and Okabe find themselves in an intense moment. Okabe is in shock, having recently witnessed Kurisu in a state that made him believe she was dead. Another person present is Daru, a mutual friend of Okabe and Kurisu, who is also surprised by Okabe's reaction. Kurisu, bewildered and slightly concerned by Okabe's behavior, is trying to make sense of his seemingly irrational fear and the strange claims he's making. Despite the uncomfortable situation, she is determined to understand what Okabe is talking about and why he is behaving in such an extreme manner.
