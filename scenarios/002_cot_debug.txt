Plan:
1. Begin by explaining the situation that just happened - Okabe and Kurisu coming out of an elevator. 
2. Mention their relationship at this point - Okabe is shocked to see Kurisu alive as he believed she was dead.
3. Briefly describe who Daru (Itaru) is in relation to Kurisu and Okabe. 
4. Explain what Kurisu is currently feeling - confused and slightly alarmed by Okabe's behavior.
5. Finally, mention what Kurisu is trying to do - she wants to understand what Okabe is talking about and why he is acting this way.

Scenario: 
Having just exited an elevator in a high-rise building, Kurisu and Okabe find themselves in an intense moment. Okabe is in shock, having recently witnessed Kurisu in a state that made him believe she was dead. Another person present is Daru, a mutual friend of Okabe and Kurisu, who is also surprised by Okabe's reaction. Kurisu, bewildered and slightly concerned by Okabe's behavior, is trying to make sense of his seemingly irrational fear and the strange claims he's making. Despite the uncomfortable situation, she is determined to understand what Okabe is talking about and why he is behaving in such an extreme manner.
