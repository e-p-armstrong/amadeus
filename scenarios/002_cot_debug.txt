The scene most likely takes place in the early episodes of Steins;Gate, where Okabe and Mayuri attend a conference about time travel. Okabe, being suspicious of the event, is keen to uncover any potential conspiracies, while Mayuri is more interested in capsule toy machines. 

"Scenario: Okabe and Mayuri, two close friends with contrasting interests, find themselves in a bustling building where a conference about advanced scientific theories is taking place. Okabe, with a natural inclination towards uncovering conspiracies, probes into an unexpected explosion that has occurred in the vicinity, while Mayuri, a carefree and somewhat air-headed young woman, is more captivated by the capsule toy machines nearby. Amidst the chaos, Okabe reaches out to an undisclosed recipient over the phone, expressing his concerns about the suspicious events while promising not to jeopardize an unnamed mission. Meanwhile, blissfully unaware of Okabe's concerns, Mayuri expresses her desire to win a toy from the machine, revealing her innocent and light-hearted nature. As Okabe balances his intrigue with the need for caution, and Mayuri seeks to fulfill her simple wish, the mood of the scene oscillates between suspense and whimsy."
