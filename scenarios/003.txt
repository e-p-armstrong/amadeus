 In a small, underwhelming conference room, Okabe and Mayuri, friends and fellow enthusiasts of the extraordinary, attend a lecture on time travel. Okabe, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist," often plays the role of a skeptic, while Mayuri, his childhood friend, is more innocent and trusting. Before the lecture starts, they engage in a light-hearted exchange over a rare toy from a capsule machine, a moment of levity amidst their anticipation. Suddenly, the lecture begins, and Doctor Nakabachi, a man claiming to have invented a time machine, takes the stage. The mood quickly shifts from anticipation to skepticism as Okabe listens to Nakabachi's presentation, growing increasingly convinced that the man is a fraud. Okabe's goal is to expose Nakabachi's deceit, while Mayuri is simply there to support her friend. The overall mood of the scene is a mix of lighthearted banter, anticipation, skepticism, and rising tension."
