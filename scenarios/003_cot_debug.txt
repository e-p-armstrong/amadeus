Plan:
1. Begin by setting the scene - a lecture hall where Kurisu is about to deliver a lecture on time travel. 
2. Mention Okabe's presence and his bizarre behavior before the lecture (without detailing the exact events).
3. Describe Kurisu's relationship with Okabe and the other characters present in the scene (Itaru or Daru). 
4. Indicate that Kurisu is feeling confused and challenged because of Okabe's behavior.
5. Conclude by stating that Kurisu is about to start her lecture, despite the strange interruptions.

Scenario:
Inside a bustling lecture hall, Kurisu stands at the podium, poised to deliver a lecture on time travel. Okabe, a peculiar young man known for his eccentricities, is also in attendance, having displayed some unusual behavior prior. Kurisu is familiar with Okabe from a previous encounter, but his behavior remains a mystery to her. Itaru, a friend of Okabe's, is also present, known to Kurisu as a fellow attendee. As she tries to understand Okabe's strange outbursts, Kurisu attempts to regain control of the situation and begin her lecture, undeterred by the odd interruptions.
