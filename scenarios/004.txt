In a bustling scientific conference, Okabe Rintaro, a young man with a flair for the dramatic and a deep suspicion of a so-called 'Organization', finds himself in the midst of a verbal altercation with Dr. Nakabachi, a fellow inventor he deems fraudulent. Suddenly, his arm is grabbed by a young woman, Makise Kurisu, a recognized genius who has just graduated from an American university and had her thesis published in a major scientific journal. Despite having only seen her photograph, Okabe instantly recognizes her and is puzzled by her interest in him. As she asks him to step aside for a chat, Okabe's paranoia kicks in, making him believe that Kurisu is an agent of the 'Organization' - a mysterious entity he considers a threat. The general mood of the scene is tense and suspenseful, filled with Okabe's misconceptions and Kurisu's obvious confusion.
