Okabe, fresh from discovering the conference's speaker to be a fraud, is on edge, fearing Kurisu's probing questions are an attempt to expose his secrets. In this tense atmosphere, Kurisu is trying to understand why Okabe seems to know her and why he appeared upset earlier, while Okabe is determined to maintain his secrecy and escape from Kurisu. The scene is filled with tension and confusion, as paranoia and curiosity clash in this unexpected encounter.
