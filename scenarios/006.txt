Kurisu, a young genius scientist, is in the middle of presenting a complex lecture on the theoretical possibilities and inherent paradoxes of time travel. Among her audience are Okabe, a young man with a keen interest in her topic, a few students, and a professor, none of whom Kurisu knows personally. They are merely attendees of her lecture. In this discussion, Kurisu is attempting to illustrate the absurdity and impracticality of time travel, especially focusing on engaging Okabe who seems to be particularly absorbed in her presentation.
