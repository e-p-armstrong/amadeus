 Okabe Rintaro, an eccentric young man with a flair for the dramatic, and his childhood friend, Mayuri, find themselves in an assembly hall just after a conference has ended. Okabe, who is overly protective of the innocent and often oblivious Mayuri, is initially panicked and worried when he cannot find her, fearing that she might have been kidnapped or wandered off. However, he soon finds her, looking lost in a corner of the hall, and his worry turns into amusement when he learns that she has lost a toy - a Metal Upa - and is looking for it. Despite initial teasing, Okabe decides to join Mayuri in her search for the valuable toy. The overall mood of the scene is light-hearted and humorous, despite Okabe's initial worry, showcasing the bond and camaraderie between the two friends.
