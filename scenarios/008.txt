Kurisu, Okabe, and Okabe's friend, Itaru, are in a lab where an unexpected event has occurred - a banana has turned into a gel-like substance. Having only met Okabe the previous day, Kurisu maintains a somewhat contentious relationship with him, while she has virtually no relationship with Itaru. As a genius in her field, Kurisu is intrigued by the gelified banana and is attempting to investigate it further. Despite Okabe's odd behaviors and reactions, she presses on to scrutinize this peculiar phenomenon, all while navigating the unusual dynamics of her companions.
