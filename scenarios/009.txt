In the bustling heart of Tokyo, Okabe stands alone on an eerily deserted street that was, moments ago, teeming with life. As a self-proclaimed "mad scientist," Okabe is no stranger to strange occurrences, but even this has him rattled. In an attempt to remain grounded in the face of the inexplicable, he talks to an unseen audience through a monitor, passionately describing his workplace, the Future Gadget Laboratory â€” a hub of scientific experimentation and innovation located in Tokyo's electronic district, Akihabara. 

His monologue is interspersed with casual banter from Mayuri, his long-time friend and lab companion, who seems unaware of the strange circumstances unfolding in Okabe's surroundings. Okabe is determined to make sense of the situation, all while continuing his impassioned plea for new recruits to join his laboratory. The scene is a maelstrom of chaos and confusion, with Okabe's excited ramblings providing a surreal contrast to the eerie silence of the deserted street.
