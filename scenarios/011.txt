In the cluttered, gadget-filled Future Gadget Laboratory, Okabe, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist," is stuck with his close friend, Daru, an expert in software and hardware, and Mayuri, a cherished but scatterbrained friend who's in charge of costume-making for the lab. Okabe and Daru are engrossed in their usual activities: Okabe is playing a game and Daru is fixated at his computer, while Mayuri is carefully sewing costumes. However, the mood swiftly turns sour when Okabe, out of frustration with an unresponsive alpaca character in his game, accidentally breaks the lab's leased TV. As the lab's leader, Okabe takes responsibility for the mishap and plans to get the TV repaired. Despite the brewing frustration and oppressive summer heat, the intent of each character is clear: Okabe dealing with the broken TV, Daru continuing his computer work, and Mayuri persisting on her costume-making. The overall mood of the scene is a mix of frustration and irritation, peppered with the typical banter and camaraderie that binds the trio.
