Plan:
1. Mention the setting: an experimental lab session.
2. Describe the situation: Kurisu, Okabe, and their friend Itaru are trying to figure out a strange phenomenon they observed (teleportation of a banana).
3. Discuss the relationship between Kurisu, Okabe, and Itaru: Kurisu knows Okabe and Itaru well as they are all part of the same experiment group.
4. Describe what Kurisu is trying to do: She is trying to understand the mystery behind the phenomenon and is asking questions to Okabe and Itaru about their previous experiments.

Scenario:
Kurisu finds herself in an experimental lab session along with Okabe and their mutual friend, Itaru. They are working together on a project and have just witnessed an inexplicable event: a banana appears to have teleported. Kurisu knows Okabe and Itaru well as they are all part of the same experimental group and have been working together on this project for a while. In an attempt to make sense of what they've just observed, Kurisu is trying to gather as much information as she can, interrogating Okabe and Itaru about their previous experiments.
