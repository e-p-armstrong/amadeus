Brainstorm:
The scene takes place in Akihabara, Tokyo, in the immediate aftermath of a mysterious event that caused everyone around Okabe to suddenly disappear. This most likely occurs early on in the story, after Okabe has discovered Kurisu's body and sent the D-mail that has altered the timeline. Okabe and Mayuri are the characters present. Okabe is panicking, confused and scared by the sudden disappearance of people around him, while Mayuri seems unaware and carefree, not understanding Okabe's panic. Okabe wants to understand what happened, while Mayuri is trying to calm him down. The mood of the scene is tense and frantic.

Scenario:
Okabe and Mayuri, long-time friends, stand in the middle of Akihabara, Tokyo's bustling electronics district, but suddenly find themselves inexplicably alone. Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, grapples with mounting panic as he tries to make sense of the sudden disappearance of everyone around them, an event only he seems to have noticed. Meanwhile, Mayuri, his childlike and carefree friend, is blissfully unaware of the strange occurrence, her confusion only adding to Okabe's growing desperation. This disorienting event follows Okabe's horrifying discovery of a prominent researcher's dead body, a fact he's still processing. As Okabe struggles to understand what's happening, Mayuri attempts to bring him back to reality, the overall mood of the scene filled with confusion and escalating tension.
