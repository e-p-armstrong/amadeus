 In the aftermath of a mysterious machine crashing into a building in Akihabara, Tokyo, Okabe Rintaro and his childhood friend Mayuri are standing nearby, trying to make sense of what just happened. Their relationship is characterized by a deep bond of friendship and mutual concern. Okabe is in a state of confusion and disbelief, questioning his own memories, as what he experienced - a mass disappearance and a murder - seems to be unknown to everyone else. Shortly after the crash, they are approached by a stern policeman who insists they leave the restricted area. As Okabe and Mayuri return to their lab, joined by their fellow friend and scientist, Daru, Okabe begins to hypothesize that their government might be under the influence of a covert organization, leading to a coverup of the recent events. Their goal in this scene is to make sense of the inexplicable circumstances they are facing, with Okabe particularly determined to uncover what he believes to be a grand conspiracy. The overall mood is one of intense bewilderment and rising tension, bordering on paranoia.
