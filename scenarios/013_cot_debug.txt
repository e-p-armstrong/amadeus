Plan:
1. Begin by setting up the situation, they are in a lab working on an experimental device.
2. Introduce the characters present other than Kurisu and Okabe, briefly explaining their relation to Kurisu.
3. Describe how well Kurisu knows each of them, including Okabe, at this point in their interaction.
4. Describe what Kurisu is currently trying to do.

Scenario:
Kurisu finds herself in a small lab where an unusual experiment is taking place, involving a microwave that apparently can send text messages to the past. She is in the company of Okabe, a mad scientist she's recently met; Itaru, a tech-savvy young man; and Mayuri, a cheerful and ditzy girl. Though new to the group, she has a basic understanding of each of them: Okabe's eccentric personality, Itaru's technical expertise, and Mayuri's innocent enthusiasm. Despite the chaotic setting, Kurisu is attempting to understand the mechanics behind this bewildering technology.
