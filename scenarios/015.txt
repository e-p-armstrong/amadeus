 Okabe Rintarou, Mayuri Shiina, and Itaru Hashida are in their makeshift science lab, a small apartment cluttered with gadgets and experiments. Okabe, the eccentric and ambitious leader of the team, is experimenting with their modified microwave, the PhoneWave (name subject to change), which they have recently discovered can send text messages back in time. Mayuri, Okabe's friendly and somewhat naive childhood friend, is concerned about the wasteful use of bananas in their experiments, which turn into a gel-like state and she affectionately dubs "gelbanas". Itaru, the technical expert of the group, watches and comments on the process, providing occasional technical insights. The mood is light yet tense, as they navigate the uncharted waters of their newfound invention. The main objective for Okabe and Itaru is to understand and improve the functioning of the PhoneWave, while Mayuri is more invested in the well-being of her beloved "gelbanas".
