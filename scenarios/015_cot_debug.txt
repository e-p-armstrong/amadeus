Plan:
1. Begin with the setting and the recent discovery that has taken place.
2. Describe Okabe's condition, his exhaustion and the fact that he just revealed a groundbreaking discovery.
3. Mention Daru, who is present in the lab but not directly involved in the conversation.
4. Describe Kurisu's current state of disbelief and confusion regarding the revelation.
5. End with Kurisu's intention, which is to question and challenge Okabe's claim.

Scenario:
After a night of intense experimentation, Kurisu finds herself in a small, humid lab with Okabe, who is visibly exhausted but high on a significant discovery. Sitting in front of his computer, uninvolved in the conversation, is Daru, a friend of Okabe's. Kurisu, who knows Okabe and Daru from their shared research, is taken aback when Okabe claims that their 'PhoneWave' is a time machine. She is in a state of disbelief and confusion, unable to accept the results of their experiment. Challenging Okabe's claim, Kurisu intends to confront him about this 'time machine'.
