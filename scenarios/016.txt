 In their makeshift lab, a place of wild theories and peculiar experiments, Okabe Rintaro, Itaru "Daru" Hashida, and Mayuri Shiina are gathered around an ordinary microwave that has produced an extraordinary result: bananas turned into a gel-like state, or "gelbanas." Okabe, the eccentric "mad scientist," leads the discussion with grand gestures and dramatic theories, while the more grounded Daru tries to make sense of the phenomenon with his technical knowledge; Mayuri, on the other hand, brings an innocent and less scientific perspective to the table. The trio's camaraderie is evident, with Okabe and Daru engaging in banter and Mayuri playing the part of the innocent bystander. The immediate concern for them is to figure out why the bananas turned into "gelbanas," and while Okabe seems to have a theory, Daru and Mayuri are less convinced. The overall mood of the scene is humorous and light-hearted, with a dash of scientific mystery.
