 In a modern building called Daibiru, located in the heart of a bustling city, two friends and budding scientists, Okabe and Daru, find themselves escaping the summer heat. Daru, always glued to his phone, is engrossed in the latest online chatter, while Okabe, the more eccentric of the two, is eager to discuss their latest invention, a prototype time machine named the PhoneWave. Okabe and Daru share a complex friendship, mixed with both respect for each other's intellect and frustration at their contrasting personalities. As Okabe attempts to convince Daru about his theories regarding the PhoneWave, they bump into a young woman named Kurisu, whom Okabe had earlier believed to be dead, creating a sense of shock and confusion. In this tense scene, Okabe's immediate goal is to understand how Kurisu is alive and seemingly unscathed, while Daru appears to be indifferent to Okabe's shock, adding to the bewildering circumstances. The overall mood of the scene is tense, filled with surprise and disbelief.
