 In a shared laboratory cluttered with experimental equipment, three scientists, Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru, are in the midst of a heated discussion. Okabe, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist" and Itaru's long-time friend, is in a state of disbelief after witnessing Kurisu, a newly-joined genius scientist, apparently dead earlier, only to see her alive and well now. Okabe is troubled by an email he had sent to Itaru about Kurisu's supposed death, which Itaru received before it was sent, indicating a time anomaly potentially related to their prototype time machine. Amidst this confusion, Okabe is desperately trying to reconcile his memory of Kurisu's death with her apparent survival, while Kurisu is on the defensive, flustered by Okabe's accusations and bizarre behavior. The scene is suspenseful and tense, filled with mystery, disbelief, and an undertone of dark humor.
