They are in a lab where they have spent time together, tinkering with a machine they call the PhoneWave. Kurisu knows Okabe well, having dealt with his peculiarities and outlandish theories on many occasions. Despite Okabe's eccentricity, Kurisu is trying to engage with him, attempting to understand his perspective on the topic they are discussing.
