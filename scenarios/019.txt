At a science event, friends and science enthusiasts Okabe Rintaro and Itaru "Daru" Hashida encounter the young genius scientist Makise Kurisu. Okabe, under the strain of a memory no one else shares, insists that he saw Kurisu dead earlier in the day, while a confused and embarrassed Kurisu denies this. This leads to a tense and confusing discussion, with Okabe trying to reconcile his memory with reality, Kurisu aiming to understand Okabe's strange claim, and Daru hoping to enjoy the scheduled lecture undisturbed. This puzzling interaction takes place in the backdrop of a science lecture that Kurisu, to the surprise of Okabe and Daru, turns out to be delivering. The overall mood of the scene is one of tension and confusion due to the clash between Okabe's memories and everyone else's reality.
