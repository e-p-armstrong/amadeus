This scene appears to be set in the early stages of the Steins;Gate timeline, where Okabe Rintaro and Itaru "Daru" Hashida first encounter the genius scientist Makise Kurisu at a science event. Okabe insists on having seen Kurisu dead, a memory no one else shares, raising questions about his sanity and reality.

First, I will set the location, which is at a science event where a lecture is about to be held. I will identify the main characters present: Okabe, Daru, and Kurisu. I will also note that Okabe and Daru are friends and fellow science enthusiasts, while Kurisu is a stranger to them at this point.

Next, I will describe the relationships and current emotional states of each character. Okabe is confused and anxious due to his inexplicable memory of Kurisu's death. Daru is nonchalant and mostly interested in the event, while Kurisu is surprised and embarrassed by Okabe's strange behavior.

I will then briefly explain the significant events leading up to the scene: Okabe's memory of Kurisu's death, and the confusion this causes when he sees her alive. I will also note that Okabe's insistence on his memory clashes with everyone else's reality, leading to an awkward conversation.

I will then state the characters' goals in the scene: Okabe wants to understand why his memory doesn't match reality, Kurisu wants to clarify the situation, and Daru wants to enjoy the lecture.

Finally, I will describe the overall mood of the scene as tense and confusing due to Okabe's strange memory and the ensuing discussion.

The scene does not seem to contain any specific Steins;Gate terms that need clarification.

Scenario:
At a science event, friends and science enthusiasts Okabe Rintaro and Itaru "Daru" Hashida encounter the young genius scientist Makise Kurisu. Okabe, under the strain of a memory no one else shares, insists that he saw Kurisu dead earlier in the day, while a confused and embarrassed Kurisu denies this. This leads to a tense and confusing discussion, with Okabe trying to reconcile his memory with reality, Kurisu aiming to understand Okabe's strange claim, and Daru hoping to enjoy the scheduled lecture undisturbed. This puzzling interaction takes place in the backdrop of a science lecture that Kurisu, to the surprise of Okabe and Daru, turns out to be delivering. The overall mood of the scene is one of tension and confusion due to the clash between Okabe's memories and everyone else's reality.
