 In the buzzing environment of a scientific seminar, Kurisu, a genius scientist, is delivering an intense and complex lecture about time travel, focusing on theories involving cosmic strings and wormholes. Okabe, a fellow scientist and audience member, listens attentively, his mind racing with questions and doubts. Their relationship is tense and competitive, a battle of wits where each tries to outsmart the other. As Kurisu delves into the intricacies of her theory, touching on concepts of space-time distortion, relativity, and the immense energy required for time travel, she challenges Okabe directly, putting him on the spot. Okabe, feeling the pressure of her challenge but unwilling to back down, prepares to respond, the atmosphere in the room growing thick with anticipation.
