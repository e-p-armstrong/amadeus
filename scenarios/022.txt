At a time travel lecture held in a university auditorium, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist with a curiosity for the unknown, listens attentively to Kurisu, a genius scientist who is the speaker. Despite their contrasting personalities, Okabe's eccentricity and Kurisu's intellectual prowess, they share a mutual respect and curiosity for the subject matter. Okabe, despite his eagerness, struggles to grasp the complex theories Kurisu presents, while Kurisu takes pleasure in enlightening the audience, and subtly teasing Okabe with her superior knowledge. The lecture, a deep dive into the theoretical prospect of time travel, serves as a precursor to the time-altering adventures they will later experience. The scene is intellectually intense, with Okabe striving to understand Kurisu's theories and Kurisu challenging the audience's understanding of time and space, creating a mood of academic rigor laced with a hint of playful banter.
