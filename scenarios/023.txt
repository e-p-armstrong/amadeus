 In an academic seminar room, genius scientist Kurisu, eccentric "mad scientist" Okabe, and an unnamed student find themselves engaged in a deep discussion about the concept of time travel and paradoxes. Their relationship at this point is one of mutual scientific interest, with Kurisu holding a firm stance against the possibility of time travel, a concept that Okabe is fascinated with but doesn't fully grasp. The mood is serious and intellectual, with a hint of tension as Kurisu vehemently explains her understanding of the Grandfather Paradox, a common concept in time travel discussions. While Okabe listens attentively, struggling to follow her logic, an unnamed student engages with the discussion, bringing a sense of curiosity and openness to the otherwise tense conversation. As Kurisu continues to disprove the feasibility of time travel, Okabe is left grappling with these new insights, his fascination with the subject only deepening.
