In the mid-afternoon heat outside a main building, Okabe finds himself in the company of two of his close friends: the effeminate Luka, dressed in traditional miko attire, and the cheerful Mayuri. Okabe, known for his eccentric behavior and love for dramatic narratives, shares a unique rapport with both Luka and Mayuri, often roping them into his wild imaginings. At this moment, Okabe is engaging in a playful conversation with Luka about the Demon Sword Samidare - a cheap imitation sword he had previously gifted to Luka, now imbued with fabricated tales of power and purpose. As Luka responds timidly to Okabe's questions about his 'practice' with the sword, Mayuri watches on, her innocent curiosity adding to the light-hearted atmosphere. The goal here is simple - Okabe wishes to continue his imaginative narrative, pushing Luka to engage more with his story, while Mayuri observes, often chiming in with her own comments. The overall mood of the scene is upbeat and playful, a moment of respite in the midst of their time-travel adventures.
