Plan:
1. Describe the setting - Kurisu and Okabe are at a shrine trying to move a heavy computer.
2. Describe the other characters present - Luka, a friend of Okabe and Kurisu.
3. Describe Kurisu's interaction with Okabe - they are arguing about how to transport the computer.
4. Conclude with Kurisu's intention - she's trying to convince Okabe to share the load with her.

Scenario:
After a day of scavenging for parts, Kurisu and Okabe find themselves in a shrine, tasked with the challenge of moving a heavy computer back to their lab. Luka, a timid and gentle friend of theirs, is also present at the shrine, offering his help. Kurisu, known for her sharp intellect but not for her physical strength, tries to lift the heavy box, but fails, leading to an argument with Okabe about the best way to transport it. Determined not to leave the task solely to Okabe, Kurisu attempts to convince him to share the load so they can carry the computer back to their lab together.
