Kurisu, Okabe, and Suzuha are in the midst of moving a heavy box, presumably containing important equipment, outside a workshop where Suzuha is a part-time worker. Kurisu knows Okabe well, having interacted with him on numerous occasions and developed an understanding of his eccentric character. However, her familiarity with Suzuha is non-existent, with this being the first time they cross paths. At the start of the scene, Kurisu is mainly preoccupied with assisting Okabe in carefully moving the heavy box without causing any damage.
