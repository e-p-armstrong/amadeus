 
In a tranquil shrine, childhood friends Okabe and Mayuri are having a casual conversation, joined by their friend Luka who resides within the shrine grounds. Mayuri, a cheerful high school girl, checks the time on her treasured pocket watch before announcing her departure for work, leaving Okabe and Luka alone. Okabe, who earlier in the day heard a man scream—an event that Mayuri does not recall—calls for an exorcism to be performed by Luka, claiming that an 'evil spirit' resides in his arm. While Mayuri is set on her daily routine, Okabe is determined to uncover the mystery behind the scream and rid his arm of the 'evil spirit', putting Luka in the unexpected role of exorcist. The overall mood of the scene is light-hearted and humorous, as the seriousness of an exorcism is juxtaposed with the everyday normality of the characters' lives.
