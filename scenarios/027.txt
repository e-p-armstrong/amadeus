Okabe and Luka, a timid young man he's familiar with, are at the base of a precarious building, in need of help to move a heavy object upstairs. Kurisu, who knows both Okabe and Luka, is waiting in the lab on the second floor. After Okabe calls out for assistance, Kurisu, irritated by his antics and his failure to answer his phone, decides to confront him about his lack of communication.
