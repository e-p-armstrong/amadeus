Scenario:
In the lab where Okabe and his friends conduct their experiments, Luka attempts to help Okabe alleviate an ailment of unknown origin, wielding an oonusa—or a Shinto wand—to drive away an "evil spirit." Okabe, appreciating Luka's concern, plays along with the ritual, further deepening their friendly bond. After the ritual, Okabe must deal with a broken TV, which leads him to the Braun Tube Workshop owned by Tennouji. Okabe and Tennouji share a more business-like relationship, with Okabe relying on Tennouji for technical help. The scene shifts from concern and reassurance between Okabe and Luka, to friendly and casual banter between Okabe and Tennouji, illustrating the different dynamics Okabe shares with those around him.
