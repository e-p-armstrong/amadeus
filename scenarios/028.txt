Kurisu finds herself at the Yanabayashi Shrine, a traditional Shinto shrine, along with Okabe, Mayuri, and Luka, her acquaintances from the Future Gadget Laboratory. They are there because Okabe has managed to acquire a piece of vintage computing equipment, the IBN 5100. During the course of their task, they encounter Suzuha, a part-time worker at a nearby shop, who Kurisu is meeting for the first time. As the group works to transport the bulky equipment to their lab, Kurisu is trying to figure out why Okabe needed this equipment and what he intends to do with it.
