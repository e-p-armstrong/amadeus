 In Tennouji's TV repair shop, eccentric "mad scientist" Okabe and pragmatic shop owner Tennouji encounter a new character, Suzuha, who seeks employment at the shop due to her love for CRTs. As Tennouji's tenant and frequent customer, Okabe often indulges in his wild fantasies about an imaginary enemy he calls the "Organization", much to Tennouji's exasperation. Amidst the cluttered shop, Suzuha is hired on the spot by Tennouji, after which she earnestly offers her help to Okabe against his fictional "Organization", revealing a surprising sincerity beneath her naïveté. Despite the casual setting, a spark of intrigue is kindled as Suzuha's earnestness and Okabe's eccentricity collide, each assessing the other in their unique ways. The scene carries an upbeat and humorous tone, as the characters navigate their introduction under the guise of a hiring interview.
