In the heart of Akihabara, at a popular maid café known as MayQueen+Nyan², Itaru, a laid-back tech wizard, finds himself engaged in a phone call with his friend, Okabe, an eccentric self-proclaimed mad scientist. Despite their shared love for scientific experiments, their current environments couldn't be more different; Itaru is immersed in the whimsical world of maid cafes while Okabe navigates the somber confines of their shared laboratory. Okabe, who has just discovered the surprising return of John Titor, a time traveler they've had dealings with in the past, urgently wants to discuss this with Itaru. Over the phone, Okabe, serious and a bit hush-hush, asks Itaru, who is relaxed and enjoying his time at the café, to stay put until he arrives. The contrast between Okabe's intense secrecy and Itaru's casual demeanor sets a scene that is both serious and lightly humorous.
