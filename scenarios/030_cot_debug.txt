Plan:
1. Describe the setting - a casual gathering of friends sharing drinks and discussing their latest intrigue.
2. Clarify the characters present in the scene - Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru (Daru) - and how well Kurisu knows them.
3. Mention the ongoing discussion about SERN, LHC, and the IBN 5100, which is the topic that Kurisu is diving into.
4. End by stating Kurisu's objective - to seek proof of Okabe's claims about SERN's secret research.

Scenario:
In a relaxed atmosphere, Kurisu is sharing a drink with Okabe and his close friend Itaru, also known as Daru, whom she has recently become acquainted with. The conversation revolves around Okabe and Daru's discoveries about SERN's secret activities, including their use of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for undisclosed time travel research and the mysterious involvement of a device called the IBN 5100. Despite being relatively new to the group, Kurisu, a highly intelligent young scientist herself, is intrigued by these revelations. As the conversation progresses, she seeks to challenge Okabe's claims, aiming to uncover substantial evidence that supports his audacious allegations about SERN's covert operations.
