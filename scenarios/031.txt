In an unspecified public place, Okabe finds himself in a frustrating conversation with the mysterious Moeka. Despite their shared history, they struggle to connect, their conversation punctuated by a persistent issue with a phone transfer that refuses to complete. Moeka, ever aloof and distant, only adds to the tension with her cool demeanor. Leaving the bewildering interaction behind, Okabe seeks the comfort of familiarity at the MayQueen+NyanÂ² maid cafe, where he is a regular customer. The cheerful greetings from his friends Mayuri and Faris, both employees there, provide a stark contrast to his earlier encounter. As Okabe settles into the warm atmosphere, he hopes to finally relax, while Mayuri and Faris aim to keep the mood light and welcoming. The scene transitions from initial tension and frustration to a more light-hearted and comforting environment.
