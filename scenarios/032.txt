 In a bustling cafe, Okabe is caught in a playful, if somewhat frustrating, conversation with Faris, a cat-eared maid who works there. His friend Daru, infatuated with Faris, is nearby, engrossed in reading her public blog. Mayuri, another friend, is listening in, confused but interested. Faris is spinning a tale about a fictitious organization, a secret technique, and a mystical sanctuary, trying to draw Okabe and Mayuri into her fantasy. Okabe, despite his initial reluctance, finds himself playing along, while also trying to steer the conversation away from the fantastical and back to reality. Meanwhile, Daru just enjoys Faris's presence and Mayuri is curious about Faris's story. The atmosphere is light and whimsical, filled with the light-hearted banter and humor of friends hanging out.
