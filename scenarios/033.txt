 At the bustling MayQueen+Nyan², a popular maid cafe in Akihabara, Okabe, the eccentric "mad scientist," finds himself amidst his childhood friend Mayuri, the playful maid Faris, and the disgruntled hacker Daru. The cafe is known for its cat-themed costumes and playful dialect, which adds to the chaotic but light-hearted atmosphere. Okabe, bemused by the antics of Faris, seeks to move to their table and initiate their discussion, while Mayuri, oblivious and cheerful as always, guides him through the cafe. Meanwhile, Daru, feeling left out, eagerly anticipates the details of Okabe's conversation with Faris. Amidst the playful banter and the whimsical atmosphere of the cafe, the friends are yet to realize the gravity of their recent discovery — a microwave that can send messages to the past.
