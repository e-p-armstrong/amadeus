In a lab late at night, Kurisu, Okabe, and their fellow researcher, Hashida, are working on an intricate experiment. Kurisu knows both Okabe and Hashida well as they have been working together on the same project for some time. Amidst the intensity of their research, Kurisu's hunger pangs surface, leading her to reluctantly take a break. She's not only trying to figure out the variables of their experiment, but also deciding on what to eat from the lab's limited food supply.
