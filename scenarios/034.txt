 
In a casual cafe setting, Okabe Rintaro, the eccentric 'mad scientist', is engaged in a lively conversation with his close friends - the laid-back, tech-savvy Itaru "Daru" Hashida and the cheerful Mayuri, who is working as a waitress. They share a bond built over countless hours spent together in their shared laboratory and their camaraderie shines through their playful banter. Okabe, with his characteristic bravado, is trying to steer the conversation towards John Titor, a supposed time traveler and the IBN 5100, an old computer model supposedly crucial for time travel. The mood is light and fun, but beneath Okabe's jesting lies a serious quest for knowledge. Okabe's goal is to acquire information about these two subjects, and perhaps even convince Daru of their importance, while Daru and Mayuri are simply enjoying their time in the cafe, unaware of the gravity of Okabe's inquiries.
