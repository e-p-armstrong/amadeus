 In a casual, yet secretive setting, Okabe, the eccentric and somewhat paranoid leader of the Future Gadget Laboratory, is engaged in a deep discussion with his tech-savvy friend, Daru, about a vintage computer, the IBN 5100. Simultaneously, he's dealing with an unexpected email from a mysterious woman he met recently, which causes him to oscillate between intrigue and concern. As Okabe and Daru delve into internet rumours and underground shops, their playful acquaintance, Faris, unaware of the gravity of their conversation, chimes in with her cat-inspired lingo. Okabe is torn between his urge to share information about the computer with the mysterious woman and his paranoia about her intentions. The overall mood is a mix of curiosity, suspicion, and light-hearted banter, with each character absorbed in their own thoughts and agendas.
