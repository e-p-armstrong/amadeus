Simultaneously, he's dealing with an unexpected email from a mysterious woman he met recently, which causes him to oscillate between intrigue and concern. As Okabe and Daru delve into internet rumours and underground shops, their playful acquaintance, Faris, unaware of the gravity of their conversation, chimes in with her cat-inspired lingo.
