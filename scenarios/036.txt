In a small, cluttered lab, Kurisu, Okabe, and Itaru, three colleagues, are huddled around a computer screen examining a document of great importance. Kurisu, a genius scientist, and Itaru, a skilled hacker, are both well acquainted with Okabe, an eccentric individual who often spouts conspiracy theories. Despite Okabe's oddities, Kurisu respects his determination and passion for scientific discovery. As Kurisu reads aloud the contents of the document, filled with technical jargon and hints of a major scientific breakthrough, she finds herself caught between disbelief and intrigue. Kurisu is trying to decipher the meaning of the document and validate Okabe's wild theories.
