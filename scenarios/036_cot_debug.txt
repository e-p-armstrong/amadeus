The current scene appears to take place in the timeline where Okabe, Faris, and Itaru are all alive and well. They are not actively working on their time travel experiments. Instead, they seem to be enjoying a casual day at Faris's café. The atmosphere is light-hearted, with playful banter and mock-competition between friends. However, there are hints of deeper emotions as they discuss a past event connected to a game they all enjoy. 

The main Steins;Gate-specific term that appears in this scene is "RaiNet", which is a game that the characters have a shared interest in. The term "Faris Cup" also appears, which seems to be a tournament related to the game.

Now, I will write the scenario.

Scenario:
Inside a cozy and lively café, Okabe, Faris, and Itaru share a table, engaged in light-hearted banter and casual dining. Faris, the bubbly cafe owner, serves Okabe his meal with a playful twist, while Itaru, a close friend and fellow enthusiast, reacts with amusement. Their relationship is marked by playful competition and shared interests, particularly in a game called RaiNet. The conversation steers towards a tournament - the "Faris Cup", which Faris is organizing around the game RaiNet. Despite the relaxed setting, Okabe's mood dampens as he recalls a former champion of the game, hinting at a past event that still holds significance. The scene oscillates between playful banter and nostalgia, giving it a feel of bittersweet reminiscence. Okabe's goal is to enjoy his meal and navigate the conversation without delving too deep into the past, while Faris and Itaru engage him in the tournament talk, aiming to lighten the mood and encourage participation.
