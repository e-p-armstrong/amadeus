 In a cluttered lab filled with electronic equipment, two friends and co-inventors, Okabe and Itaru, are puzzling over a bizarre result from an experiment with their modified microwave, the PhoneWave, which has unexpectedly shown the ability to send messages back in time. Having started as a fun project, the PhoneWave has taken a serious turn when a test involving a banana resulted in the fruit being altered at a molecular level, a phenomenon they've termed "gelification." As Okabe, the more theatrical of the two, hypothesizes about the potential implications, Itaru, the pragmatic one, provides grounding counterpoints to his friend's dramatic theories. Their immediate goal is to understand the science behind the gelification and to figure out what to do next with their accidental time machine. The atmosphere is a blend of excitement and tension, a mix of the thrill of discovery with a growing realization of the potential consequences of their work.
