 Set in a makeshift lab, eccentric scientist Okabe and his pragmatic friend Itaru are conducting an experiment with their modified microwave, known as the PhoneWave, which has the unusual ability to turn bananas into a gel-like state. These bananas were bought by their close friend Mayuri, who is not present but is mentioned as the source of their experimental materials. Okabe, driven by scientific curiosity, is eager to push the boundaries of their experiment, even at the risk of using all the bananas, while Itaru is more concerned about the practical implications such as upsetting Mayuri. Their interactions are filled with playful banter and light-hearted humor, highlighting the strong bond between them. Okabe's goal is to uncover the true potential of the PhoneWave, while Itaru aims to keep their experiments sustainable without causing unnecessary problems. Despite the seemingly mundane setting, the room is filled with a sense of excitement and discovery.
