Kurisu is in the midst of an intense scientific discussion with Okabe and Itaru, her fellow lab members, in their makeshift laboratory. Okabe, eccentric and passionate about science, is trying to grasp the intricacies of a complex theory, while Itaru, a computer hacker and generally playful guy, is struggling to understand the scientific jargon. Having spent considerable time with both, Kurisu is familiar with their distinct personalities and quirks. With patience and a hint of exasperation, Kurisu is attempting to explain the complex scientific theory in simple, relatable terms, hoping to make the concept clearer to her friends.
