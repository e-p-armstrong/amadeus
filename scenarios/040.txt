In the cluttered, peculiarly endearing Future Gadget Lab, self-proclaimed mad scientist Okabe Rintaro and his loyal friend, the hacker Itaru "Daru" Hashida, are engrossed in their latest experiment with their homemade microwave apparatus, dubbed the "PhoneWave". The two share a camaraderie built on shared experiences and a mutual passion for the unorthodox and the fantastical. Okabe, ever the dramatic, is in the middle of a spirited discourse on the virtues of inspiration, while Itaru, more pragmatic, is operating the PhoneWave, trying to gelify a banana. But their routine experiment takes a bizarre turn when the banana they were supposed to gelify inexplicably disappears from the closed microwave. With Okabe's flair for the dramatic and Daru's bewildered panic setting the tone, the pair embarks on a quest to uncover the truth behind this mysterious occurrence, tiptoeing into the realms of the extraordinary, and perhaps, the terrifying. The overall mood of the scene is a chaotic blend of suspense, curiosity, and an underlying comedic undertone, as the duo grapples with the unexpected results of their 'ordinary' experiment.
