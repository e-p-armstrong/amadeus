 Okabe Rintaro and his friend Itaru "Daru" Hashida are in their makeshift lab, examining a strange phenomenon â€” a banana seeming to teleport back to its bunch after being placed in their modified microwave, the "PhoneWave." Okabe, the eccentric and imaginative one, is excitedly theorizing about their accidental invention of a teleporter, while Daru, his more grounded friend, is uncertain but willing to go along. Suddenly, Kurisu Makise, a brilliant scientist who Okabe views as a rival and a threat, appears unexpectedly, sparking surprise and suspicion in Okabe. Okabe is defensive, accusing Kurisu of being an enemy agent and Daru of betrayal, while Daru remains calm and Kurisu tries to explain her presence. Okabe's goal is to protect his discovery and friends from perceived threats, Daru aims to maintain peace in the lab, and Kurisu is trying to build a rapport with Okabe and join their group. The scene is tense, filled with suspicion, excitement, and a hint of danger.
