The scene is most likely set in the earlier part of the story, where Okabe and his friend Daru have just discovered the strange phenomenon with their microwave and the banana, which they believe might be a teleportation event. With the sudden appearance of Kurisu, who Okabe seems to have a complicated relationship with, tensions rise. The characters in the scene are Okabe, Daru, and Kurisu. Okabe is the eccentric "mad scientist" who believes that he and Daru have invented a teleporter with their modified microwave; Daru is his right-hand man and friend who is more grounded but goes along with Okabe's theories; Kurisu is the genius scientist who Okabe has a conflicting relationship with, seeing her as an adversary but also being intrigued by her intelligence. The Steins;Gate-specific term here is "PhoneWave", which can be explained as a prototype time machine they've been experimenting with, using a microwave and a cell phone.

Scenario: Okabe Rintaro and his friend Itaru "Daru" Hashida are in their makeshift lab, examining a strange phenomenon â€” a banana seeming to teleport back to its bunch after being placed in their modified microwave, the "PhoneWave." Okabe, the eccentric and imaginative one, is excitedly theorizing about their accidental invention of a teleporter, while Daru, his more grounded friend, is uncertain but willing to go along. Suddenly, Kurisu Makise, a brilliant scientist who Okabe views as a rival and a threat, appears unexpectedly, sparking surprise and suspicion in Okabe. Okabe is defensive, accusing Kurisu of being an enemy agent and Daru of betrayal, while Daru remains calm and Kurisu tries to explain her presence. Okabe's goal is to protect his discovery and friends from perceived threats, Daru aims to maintain peace in the lab, and Kurisu is trying to build a rapport with Okabe and join their group. The scene is tense, filled with suspicion, excitement, and a hint of danger.
