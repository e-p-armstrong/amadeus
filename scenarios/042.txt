 
In the cluttered confines of a makeshift laboratory, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, finds himself alone with Kurisu, a genius scientist who has recently joined his crew. Their relationship is tenuous; misunderstandings and cultural differences fueling a sense of mistrust. Okabe is on the defensive, worried about a tarnished reputation, while Kurisu is there to confront him about an incident where he claimed to have seen her die and then reappear, and his actions afterward. She accuses him of using the situation as an excuse for inappropriate behavior, and he desperately tries to explain the truth of the situation. The atmosphere is tense, filled with clumsy attempts at humor and awkward exchanges, and the scene is set for a showdown of explanations and apologies.
