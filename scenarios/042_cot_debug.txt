Plan:
1. Define the setting - Kurisu, Okabe, and Itaru are in a lab discussing their ongoing project.
2. Describe the relationship between Kurisu, Okabe, and Itaru - they are colleagues working together on a project.
3. Mention the main issue at hand - they are trying to solve a problem related to time and space travel.
4. State Kurisu's action at the start of the scene - she is explaining the complexities of space and time travel with Okabe and Itaru.
5. Mention Kurisu's aim - to help Okabe understand the complexity of their project and the challenges they face against a more established organization.

Scenario:
In a small, cluttered lab filled with a mix of second-hand equipment and high-tech devices, Kurisu, Okabe, and Itaru are engrossed in an intense discussion about their ongoing project involving time and space travel. Okabe and Itaru are Kurisu's colleagues who, despite not being as well-versed in the complexities of the subject, genuinely share the same passion. The trio faces an uphill battle against a well-funded organization, and they are trying to figure out how they can outsmart them. At this point, Kurisu is breaking down the complexities of time and space travel to Okabe and Itaru, explaining why their task is not as simple as they might think. Kurisu's aim is to make Okabe understand the massive challenge they face, hoping to inspire new ways to overcome the obstacles in their path.
