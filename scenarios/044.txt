In the cluttered, gadget-filled Future Gadget Laboratory, eccentric scientist Okabe Rintaro, his laid-back friend Itaru Hashida, and the newly-arrived genius scientist Makise Kurisu are discussing a peculiar microwave. Their rapport is a mix of friendly banter and intellectual rivalry, particularly between Okabe and Kurisu. Okabe, wary yet intrigued by Kurisu's intellect, is reluctant to reveal the secrets of their microwave - a contraption capable of sending text messages to the past, dubbed the "PhoneWave". Prior to this, Okabe and Itaru discovered the PhoneWave's unique abilities, a revelation that now stirs Kurisu's scientific curiosity. As the conversation unfolds, Okabe attempts to maintain the secrecy of the PhoneWave while considering the benefits of Kurisu's involvement, and Kurisu, in her pursuit of knowledge, negotiates her role in the team. Amidst the clash of wits and personalities, the lab buzzes with a tense yet comically charged atmosphere.
