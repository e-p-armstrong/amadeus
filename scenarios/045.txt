 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, eccentric scientist Okabe Rintaro, genius scientist Kurisu Makise, and skilled hacker Itaru "Daru" Hashida are engaged in a discussion about their latest experiment. Okabe and Daru have been working on a device, a modified microwave they call the 'Phone Microwave', which they discovered can send text messages to the past. Kurisu, initially skeptical, has now decided to join them and apply her scientific knowledge to their endeavors. The trio engage in playful banter while discussing the scientific implications and possibilities of their device, with Okabe, the enthusiastic leader, pushing to explore its limits, Kurisu, the newly committed member, seeking to witness the experiment firsthand, and Daru, the voice of reason, occasionally refusing to partake in their activities. The overall mood is upbeat, filled with a mix of excitement, curiosity, and friendly teasing.
