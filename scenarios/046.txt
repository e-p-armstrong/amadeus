In a science lab filled with the constant hum of machinery, three passionate scientists, Okabe, Itaru, and Kurisu, are deeply engrossed in an experiment. Okabe and Itaru, old friends with a shared enthusiasm for invention, are joined by the brilliant, yet skeptical, Kurisu. Okabe, brimming with anticipation, is keen on proving the capabilities of their latest invention, the PhoneWave - a microwave-like device that has recently shown signs of anomalous behavior. Previously, the group had observed the PhoneWave teleport a banana, a phenomenon they are now desperately trying to replicate and understand. As they debate the device's potential and limitations, the atmosphere in the room is a complex blend of excitement, tension, and curiosity.
