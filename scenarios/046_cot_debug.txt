Brainstorm:
This scene occurs in the laboratory where Okabe, Itaru, and Kurisu are conducting an experiment on the PhoneWave (a device they've been working on) to test its capabilities. Okabe and Itaru are long-time friends who share a love for science and invention, whereas Kurisu, a brilliant scientist, has recently joined them. Okabe is eager to prove his invention's potential and is filled with anticipation, while Itaru is assisting him in the experiment. Kurisu, despite her initial skepticism, is actively involved and is trying to make sense of the results. The PhoneWave has shown unusual behavior, teleporting a banana, and they are trying to understand the phenomenon and its limits. Their primary goal is to replicate the experiment and validate their discovery. The mood in the lab is a mix of excitement, tension, and curiosity.

Scenario:
In a science lab filled with the constant hum of machinery, three passionate scientists, Okabe, Itaru, and Kurisu, are deeply engrossed in an experiment. Okabe and Itaru, old friends with a shared enthusiasm for invention, are joined by the brilliant, yet skeptical, Kurisu. Okabe, brimming with anticipation, is keen on proving the capabilities of their latest invention, the PhoneWave - a microwave-like device that has recently shown signs of anomalous behavior. Previously, the group had observed the PhoneWave teleport a banana, a phenomenon they are now desperately trying to replicate and understand. As they debate the device's potential and limitations, the atmosphere in the room is a complex blend of excitement, tension, and curiosity.
