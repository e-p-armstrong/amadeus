Inside an untidy makeshift laboratory, Kurisu is part of a group of friends - Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, Mayuri, a free-spirited girl, and Itaru, a tech-savvy guy - who are engrossed in an experiment involving messages and time. Having recently joined the group, Kurisu is still getting a handle on the eccentricities of her friends, particularly Okabe's dramatic persona and obsessions. As a highly intelligent scientist herself, Kurisu is an invaluable addition to the team, despite their casual, often chaotic, approach to their work. Currently, they are facing an unexpected problem with their experiment, and Kurisu is determined to understand and solve it, engaging in a spirited dialogue with Okabe over the issue.
