 In a cluttered lab filled with odd devices and a sense of uncontrolled scientific curiosity, eccentric scientist Okabe, his loyal friend and lab partner Daru, and the newly joined, cautious yet curious Kurisu, are trying to puzzle out an unusual event. They've been experimenting with a modified microwave, which unbeknownst to them, has become a rudimentary time machine. An odd discharge occurred during one of their experiments, an event Daru witnessed alone, causing a fluorescent light to fill the lab. Adding to the intrigue, Okabe's recollection of attending a certain presentation by the controversial Doctor Nakabachi - a man accused of stealing a time travel theory - appears to conflict with Daru and Kurisu's memory of the event. The trio is trying to untangle the mystery of the discharge event and the discrepancy in their memories, unknowingly teetering on the edge of a groundbreaking discovery. The overall mood is a mix of confusion, curiosity, and a tinge of escalating excitement.
