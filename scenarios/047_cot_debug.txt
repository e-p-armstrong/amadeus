The scene likely occurs relatively early in the Steins;Gate timeline. This is because the characters are discussing an unusual event that occurred with their experimental device, which later turns out to be a rudimentary time machine. It's also clear that Okabe's memory of events differs from that of the others, hinting at his unique ability to remember different timelines, which is a key aspect of the plot. The characters mentioned are Okabe, Itaru (often referred to as Daru), and Kurisu. They are in a lab, discussing an experiment. 

The Steins;Gate specific terms to define are the PhoneWave (a microwave that has been accidentally transformed into a time machine) and Doctor Nakabachi (a character who steals a time travel theory). 

Okabe and Daru are close friends and lab partners, with Okabe often taking on the role of the eccentric leader and Daru the loyal follower. Kurisu is a new addition to the lab, a genius scientist who initially clashes with Okabe but then becomes a valuable member of the team and a close friend.

Planning Phase:
1. The location is likely the lab where Okabe, Daru, and Kurisu work on their experiments. 
2. Okabe and Daru are close friends and lab partners, with Kurisu being a newer addition to the lab team.
3. Okabe is in a state of confusion and excitement, Daru is somewhat bemused, and Kurisu is curious and cautious.
4. The characters are discussing an unusual discharge event that occurred with their experimental device, which is a microwave that has accidentally been transformed into a time machine. Okabe's memory of recent events differs from that of the others, hinting at his unique ability to remember different timelines, a key aspect of the plot.
5. The characters are trying to understand what caused the unusual discharge event and why Okabe's memory of recent events differs from theirs.
6. The mood is one of confusion, curiosity, and excitement.

Scenario: In a cluttered lab filled with odd devices and a sense of uncontrolled scientific curiosity, eccentric scientist Okabe, his loyal friend and lab partner Daru, and the newly joined, cautious yet curious Kurisu, are trying to puzzle out an unusual event. They've been experimenting with a modified microwave, which unbeknownst to them, has become a rudimentary time machine. An odd discharge occurred during one of their experiments, an event Daru witnessed alone, causing a fluorescent light to fill the lab. Adding to the intrigue, Okabe's recollection of attending a certain presentation by the controversial Doctor Nakabachi - a man accused of stealing a time travel theory - appears to conflict with Daru and Kurisu's memory of the event. The trio is trying to untangle the mystery of the discharge event and the discrepancy in their memories, unknowingly teetering on the edge of a groundbreaking discovery. The overall mood is a mix of confusion, curiosity, and a tinge of escalating excitement.
