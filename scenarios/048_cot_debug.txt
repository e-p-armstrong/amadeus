Brainstorm:
1. The scene likely takes place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, the main setting of the series.
2. Okabe, Kurisu, Daru, and Mayuri are present. Okabe and Daru are long-time friends, while Kurisu is new to their circle and Mayuri is Okabe's childhood friend.
3. Okabe is in an excited, investigative state, while Kurisu is skeptical and a bit exasperated, but intrigued. Daru is amused while Mayuri remains blissfully unbothered.
4. They are attempting to understand an anomaly that occurred with their modified microwave (the PhoneWave), which sent an email with a strange timestamp and caused an electrical discharge. The PhoneWave is a microwave that can be controlled remotely via mobile phone, which they are testing.
5. Okabe's goal is to reproduce the anomaly and solve the mystery, while Kurisu is there to lend her expertise, albeit reluctantly. Daru is providing technical support, and Mayuri is there to provide a comforting presence.
6. The overall mood of the scene is a mix of tension and curiosity, with a hint of humor.

Scenario:
In the cluttered, tech-filled confines of their makeshift lab, Okabe, the eccentric self-proclaimed mad scientist, is in the middle of a heated discussion with his skeptical new recruit, the genius scientist Kurisu. His long-time friend and accomplice, Daru, is assisting with the technical aspects, while Mayuri, Okabe's endearing childhood friend, walks in, lightening the atmosphere with her innocent charm. The group is engrossed in a peculiar situation: their custom-modified microwave, the PhoneWave, which they've rigged to be controlled via mobile phone, has caused an electrical discharge and sent an email with a strange timestamp. Now, Okabe is driven to reproduce this anomaly and solve the mystery behind it, pushing Kurisu to help despite her initial reluctance. The tension is palpable as they delve deeper into the mystery, their curiosity piqued, creating an atmosphere of electrifying intrigue.
