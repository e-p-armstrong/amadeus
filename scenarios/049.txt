 Okabe, Kurisu, Daru, and Mayuri are gathered in their shared lab, a place of unconventional scientific exploration. As friends and colleagues, Okabe and Kurisu often spar verbally, their playful rivalry fostering an atmosphere of tension and curiosity. Daru obediently follows Okabe's instructions, while Mayuri, an innocent bystander, frets over her food being used in their experiments. They're embarking on another trial with the PhoneWave, a microwave-turned-time machine they've discovered can send texts to the past. As Okabe pushes to further their knowledge, Kurisu seeks to understand more about the PhoneWave, and Daru complies with Okabe's commands, Mayuri is left worried and confused. The atmosphere is charged, reflecting both the playful banter and the underlying tension of their risky experimentation.
