Brainstorming:
1. Location and characters: They are in their shared lab, a place of scientific discovery and camaraderie. Okabe, Kurisu, Itaru (Daru), and Mayuri are present.
2. Relationships: Okabe is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, and Kurisu, Daru, and Mayuri are his friends and lab members. Okabe and Kurisu share a playful rivalry. Daru is a loyal friend and Mayuri is a kind, innocent soul.
3. Emotional states: Okabe is assertive and eccentric, Kurisu is defensive but playful, Daru is complacent, and Mayuri is innocent and slightly bewildered.
4. Significant events: They are experimenting with a device (the PhoneWave, essentially a time machine), which they previously discovered can send texts to the past. They're about to experience an unexpected electrical discharge.
5. Goals: Okabe wants to push the boundaries of their experiments, Kurisu wants to understand more about the PhoneWave, Daru is following Okabe's instructions, and Mayuri is concerned about her food being used in the experiments.
6. Mood: The scene's mood is playful but with a tension underlying due to the unknown outcome of the experiment.
7. Terms: PhoneWave is a microwave that can send texts to the past.

Scenario: Okabe, Kurisu, Daru, and Mayuri are gathered in their shared lab, a place of unconventional scientific exploration. As friends and colleagues, Okabe and Kurisu often spar verbally, their playful rivalry fostering an atmosphere of tension and curiosity. Daru obediently follows Okabe's instructions, while Mayuri, an innocent bystander, frets over her food being used in their experiments. They're embarking on another trial with the PhoneWave, a microwave-turned-time machine they've discovered can send texts to the past. As Okabe pushes to further their knowledge, Kurisu seeks to understand more about the PhoneWave, and Daru complies with Okabe's commands, Mayuri is left worried and confused. The atmosphere is charged, reflecting both the playful banter and the underlying tension of their risky experimentation.
