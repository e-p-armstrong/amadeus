Kurisu finds herself in a cluttered room, engrossed in a complex discussion about a domestic appliance that seems to have inexplicable capabilities. In the room with her are Okabe, Mayuri, and Itaru, her friends and fellow enthusiasts of the strange and unknown. Kurisu, a genius scientist, knows them well as they all share a common interest in the bizarre properties of the so-called PhoneWave. Amidst this brainstorming session, Kurisu is trying to articulate her theory about the PhoneWave's unexplained phenomena, hoping to convince Okabe and the others about her perspective.
