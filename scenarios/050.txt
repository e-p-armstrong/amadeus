In a small, cluttered lab, eccentric scientist Okabe, pragmatic Itaru, sweet-natured Mayuri, and analytical Kurisu witness an unexpected scientific phenomenon unfold. This diverse group, united by their shared interest in the mysteries of time, work together on a device they have named the "PhoneWave," a modified microwave they believe can send text messages to the past. As the experiment concludes, Okabe is overcome with excitement, certain that what they've just witnessed is a breakthrough, while Kurisu remains skeptical and analytical, eager to understand the science behind the event. Itaru, the practical tech expert, is concerned about ventilation in the lab, and Mayuri mourns a chicken ruined in the experiment. In the midst of this chaotic and exciting scene, each character strives for different goals: Okabe wants to prove the success of his experiment, Kurisu seeks to understand it, Itaru addresses practical concerns, and Mayuri deals with a personal loss. The scene is a blend of excitement, curiosity, and a touch of chaos as they all confront the unexpected results of their experiment.
