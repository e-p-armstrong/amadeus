 In a cluttered lab, Okabe and Kurisu, two scientists with a shared passion but contrasting views, are engaged in an intense debate. Okabe, with his characteristic bravado, is trying to convince a skeptical Kurisu of their microwave device's newfound ability to send text messages to the past - a claim Kurisu finds hard to believe. The atmosphere is charged, heavy with the weight of potential scientific breakthrough and the friction between the two. As Okabe passionately lays out the evidence, Kurisu, despite her reservations, is pushed to grapple with the implications of such a discovery. Their immediate goal is to either validate or disprove this astonishing claim, their interaction a volatile mix of scientific fervor and personal tension.
