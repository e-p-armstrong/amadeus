Amidst a passionate discussion at the Future Gadget Laboratory, a frequent gathering spot, Okabe, an eccentric self-proclaimed scientist, and his friends, Itaru, a computer whiz, and Mayuri, a kind-hearted cosplayer, are excitedly debating the unexpected findings of their latest invention. Kurisu, a genius young scientist who recently joined them, is also present, listening intently to their claims about the discovery of a potential time machine. She's familiar with the enthusiastic group but often finds herself acting as the voice of reason amidst their wild theories. Despite her initial skepticism, Kurisu is intrigued by the group's findings and is considering a deeper investigation into what they believe to be a time-travel mechanism.
