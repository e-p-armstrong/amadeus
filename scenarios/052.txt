Okabe Rintaro and Itaru "Daru" Hashida are in their shared lab, a place where they spend much of their time conducting experiments and discussing scientific theories. The two of them are not just colleagues but also close friends, each complementing the other with their unique skills and knowledge. As Itaru lethargically browses through images on his computer, Okabe grows increasingly curious about what's captured his friend's interest. Itaru is engrossed in images of the Large Hadron Collider, a particle accelerator used by the research organization SERN for their experiments. Intrigued by recent predictions made by the self-proclaimed time traveler John Titor about SERN's role in future time travel, Okabe's goal is to understand more about the Large Hadron Collider and its relevance to Titor's predictions. The overall mood of the scene is a mix of casual banter and growing curiosity.
