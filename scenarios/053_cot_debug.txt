Brainstorming:

This scene takes place in the lab where Okabe and Itaru, also known as Daru, are working on their time machine invention, the "PhoneWave". The dialogue suggests that they are in the early stages of their experimentation, as they are discussing the possibility of investigating SERN, a renowned scientific research institution. Okabe, the passionate and curious "mad scientist", is intrigued by the potential connections between their work and SERN's research. Daru, an avid computer hacker and otaku, is more than willing to delve into the details about SERN. The mood of the scene, driven by Okabe's renewed vigor and curiosity, is simultaneously serious and slightly humorous, due to Daru's otaku references. The main goal of the characters in the scene is to gather as much information about SERN as possible.

Scenario:

In the cluttered, tech-filled lab, Okabe and Itaru, two aspiring scientists, find themselves engrossed in a discussion about their invention, a time machine they've named the "PhoneWave". Okabe, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist", is driven by an insatiable curiosity and a fervor for the unknown, while Itaru, a computer genius with an otaku lifestyle, is his reliable and equally enthusiastic counterpart. Recently, their work on the "PhoneWave" has encountered some difficulties, leading Okabe to propose a new directionâ€”investigating SERN, a global leader in particle physics research. As Okabe pushes for more information, Itaru enthusiastically dives into his extensive knowledge about SERN, sharing about its various research areas and its potential connection to the creation of mini black holes, an aspect that deeply intrigues Okabe given its relevance to their time machine project. The scene is a blend of intense scientific discussion and lighthearted humor, as both characters strive to forge their path into the uncharted territories of time travel.
