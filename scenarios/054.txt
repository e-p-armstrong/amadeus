Following a bizarre occurrence involving a machine they've been developing, Kurisu finds herself in a laboratory amongst a group of eccentric individuals, including Okabe, the group's leader, and Suzuha, a part-time worker from downstairs who's intrigued by their activities. Kurisu, despite being relatively new to the group, has already established a contentious relationship with Okabe, who insists on calling her an assistant. There's also Moeka, a quiet woman who seems to be observing the situation. In the midst of this, Kurisu engages in their discussion, trying to make sense of the machine's strange behavior and Okabe's unconventional methods of operation.
