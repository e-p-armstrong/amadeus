The scene likely takes place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, where Okabe and Daru have been working on their time machine. This particular interaction seems to occur after Okabe and his friends have discovered the ability to send D-mails, but before the lab is raided by SERN. Okabe and Daru are close friends and lab mates, with their relationship being characterized by Okabe's eccentricity and Daru's exasperation with it. Okabe, the self-proclaimed mad scientist, has a tendency to be dramatic and vague, which often frustrates Daru, the more practical and grounded hacker of the group. The scene begins with Okabe having a cryptic conversation with Daru, who is initially unresponsive and disinterested, but eventually gets excited and agrees to help Okabe. The Steins;Gate-specific terms that need to be defined are: PhoneWave, a prototype time machine that can send texts to the past; SERN, an organization that becomes a threat to Okabe and his friends; and super hacka, a term Okabe uses to refer to Daru's hacking skills.

Scenario: Okabe Rintaro and his friend Itaru Hashida, more commonly known as Daru, are in their makeshift lab, surrounded by a jumble of electronic equipment and half-eaten snacks. They share a unique friendship, characterized by Okabe's theatrical declarations and Daru's pithy comebacks. Okabe, ever the eccentric scientist, is trying to make Daru understand his latest plan while Daru, the grounded hacker, is trying to decipher Okabe's cryptic words. They've recently discovered that their invention, a microwave-turned-prototype time machine, can send messages to the past. Now, Okabe is trying to convince a skeptical Daru to hack into a powerful organization named SERN, hoping to uncover information about their rumored time machine research. The mood of the scene is a mix of tension and excitement as Okabe tries to rally Daru for their daring mission.
