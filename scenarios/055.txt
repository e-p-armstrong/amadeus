In the cluttered and tech-filled space of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is engrossed in a heated online debate, while his close friend and fellow scientist Daru is deeply focused on an undisclosed task. Their usual routine is interrupted by the arrival of Suzuha, a casual acquaintance from the Braun Tube Workshop. The atmosphere, initially relaxed, takes a sudden turn when Suzuha, who initially came to announce the repair of a TV, starts questioning about their secretive activities, revealing her accidental discovery of their lab's name and its mission against a shadowy organization known as SERN. Despite his initial surprise and suspicion, Okabe decides to share a brief explanation, warning Suzuha to keep their activities a secret. As the conversation unfolds, the tension rises, turning the once casual chat into a game of secrecy and unanticipated revelations.
