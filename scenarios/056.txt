 

At the Braun Tube Workshop, a small electronics store, Okabe, a frequent customer, finds himself in conversation with Suzuha, an employee known for her formal, almost secretive speech. Their relationship is casual, filled with playful sarcasm and banter. Okabe arrives to collect a TV he previously left for repair, while internally wrestling with suspicion and tension. Unbeknownst to Okabe, he and his friends' discussions about SERN, a potentially threatening organization interested in time travel, were overheard by Suzuha. As Okabe grapples with the realization of their carelessness, he attempts to ensure Suzuha remains tight-lipped about the information. Meanwhile, Suzuha balances her duties as a shop employee with her newfound knowledge, assuring Okabe of her discretion. This scene is a blend of light-hearted banter and underlying tension, as humorous interactions intertwine with the potential threat of leaked secrets.
