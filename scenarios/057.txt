Kurisu finds herself amongst a group of friends, including the eccentric Okabe, the quiet Mayuri, and the tech-savvy Itaru, in the midst of a peculiar discussion about sending messages to the past with their newly developed technology. Mayuri is a longtime friend of Okabe and a fellow lab member, and Itaru is Okabe's right-hand man in all things technological. Kurisu, a genius scientist who has recently joined Okabe's lab, knows them well and has a friendly, though occasionally exasperated, relationship with them. In the conversation, Kurisu is trying to understand the implications of their time-altering technology by discussing the potential outcomes and issues that could arise from using it, such as the believability of a message from the future.
