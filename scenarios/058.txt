Amid a lively discussion about the potential winnings of a contest, Kurisu finds herself in the company of Okabe, the eccentric, paranoia-ridden leader of their group, Itaru, a tech-savvy friend, and Mayuri, a sweet and naive companion. Kurisu, a genius scientist, is intimately familiar with all of them, sharing both camaraderie and intellectual pursuits. Okabe's constant fear of being discovered by an imagined "Organization" influences their decision-making process, leading to the suggestion of aiming for a lesser prize to avoid unwanted attention. Kurisu, skeptical of Okabe's reasoning, aims to question his logic and decisions, revealing her concerns about potential risks.
