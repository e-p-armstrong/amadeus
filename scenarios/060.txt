Inside the cluttered yet cozy Future Gadget Lab, Okabe, Mayuri, and Itaru share their evening. Okabe and Mayuri, close friends for a long time, engage in an easy, comfortable conversation about food preferences and Mayuri's recent purchases as Itaru, their skilled hacker friend, works tirelessly on his computer. The atmosphere is tense as Itaru attempts to infiltrate the system of a powerful, shadowy organization known as SERN, all while Okabe watches with a mix of exhaustion and anticipation. Despite the weighty task at hand, threads of warmth and camaraderie intertwine the scene as Mayuri, ever-caring and cheerful, tries to lighten the mood with her thoughtful food offerings and playful banter. As Okabe encourages Itaru's hacking endeavor, aiming to expose SERN's secret wrongdoings, Mayuri expresses her worry over the morality of their actions, setting the stage for a debate over the ethics of their mission amidst the backdrop of their friendly, homey lab.
