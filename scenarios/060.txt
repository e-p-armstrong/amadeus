After spending some time together, Kurisu finds herself in a casual conversation with Okabe and Mayuri, Okabe's long-time friend, in a relaxed setting. Mayuri, who Kurisu knows as a cheerful and carefree girl, is also present. Okabe, an eccentric young man prone to bouts of peculiar language and conspiratorial thinking, often puzzles Kurisu with his unique phrases. Unfamiliar with Okabe's jargon and intrigued by his cryptic catchphrase, Kurisu attempts to question him about the meaning of "Steins Gate".
