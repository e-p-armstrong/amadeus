In a cluttered, gadget-filled room that serves as their base of operations, Okabe, Mayuri, and Daru are engaged in everyday activities that mask their extraordinary pursuits. Okabe and Mayuri, close friends whose bond is underscored by their lighthearted bickering over food, engage in a playful trade-off, while Daru, a talented hacker, immerses himself in the complex task of infiltrating a database. The database belongs to a powerful research organization (referred to as SERN), holding potential answers to the mysteries they've been investigating. As Okabe eagerly awaits the results of Daru's hacking, he can't help but feel a mix of anticipation and anxiety, knowing that the information they uncover could change everything. The room buzzes with a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose, a light-hearted mood underpinning the serious undertones of their mission.
