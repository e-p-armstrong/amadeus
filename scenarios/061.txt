 
Kurisu finds herself in the lab with Okabe and his friends, who are embroiled in an experiment involving sending messages into the past. Okabe is a fellow scientist and the orchestrator of this experiment; Mayuri is a sweet, naive friend and lab member; Itaru, another lab member, is a tech-savvy friend; and Moeka, a somewhat mysterious and quiet character, is a recent addition to their circle. Though Kurisu is well-acquainted with everyone, she's particularly close to Okabe, often finding herself in debates with him. In the midst of the experiment, Kurisu is trying to make sense of Okabe's erratic behavior and maintain harmony within the group.
