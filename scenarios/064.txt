Their shared fascination with the mysteries of time travel, intensified by their recent discovery of a method to send text messages to the past, has led them to this point. Okabe, driven by curiosity and a thirst for truth, pushes Daru to hack further into SERN's database, despite Daru's growing concern about their safety. As they navigate the digital labyrinth, they stumble upon shocking revelations about SERN's secret experiments, including the creation of mini black holes and a mysterious document referred to as "Jellyman's Report". The air in the lab grows thick with tension and suspense as Okabe urges Daru to uncover more, while Daru grapples with the potential dangers of their daring investigation.
