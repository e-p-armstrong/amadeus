After a series of unusual events, Kurisu finds herself alone in a lab with Okabe, a fellow researcher with a knack for eccentricity. Earlier, their friends Mayuri, Daru, Lukako, and Moeka had left the lab, all of whom Kurisu is acquainted with through her association with Okabe. Okabe, usually flamboyant, is uncharacteristically gloomy, and Kurisu, intrigued by his behavior, decides to stay back despite Okabe's prodding about going back to her hotel. Feeling that Okabe might be in need of a conversation, Kurisu is determined to offer him advice, hoping that as an outsider she might provide a fresh perspective on his troubles.
