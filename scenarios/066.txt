 
Kurisu finds herself in a quiet room absorbed in a book, with Okabe, an eccentric young man prone to wild theories. Okabe is pondering whether to discuss with her a matter of time alteration he believes he has achieved, hoping that her genius mind might comprehend this better than their mutual acquaintances, Mayuri and Daru. Kurisu knows Okabe, Daru, and Mayuri fairly well by this time, tolerating their quirks while often finding herself drawn into their strange theories and experiments. As Okabe starts to share his theory of having altered the past, Kurisu finds herself intrigued, yet skeptical, keen to scrutinize and challenge his claim.
