 

In the confines of the Future Gadget Laboratory, a trio of friends are engrossed in an intense discussion. Okabe, the self-proclaimed leader and mad scientist, is in deep conversation with Itaru, the group's expert hacker, while Mayuri, a close friend, is engrossed in her sewing, seemingly indifferent to the tension in the room. The group has recently discovered a hidden function in a vintage computer, the IBN 5100, which can decipher an obsolete programming language, a piece of information revealed to them by a supposed time traveler. This discovery has sparked a flame in Okabe, who is eager to use this knowledge to challenge SERN, a scientific institute they believe is conducting illicit research. Itaru, on the other hand, is attempting to understand the implications of this revelation, while Mayuri remains detached. The overall mood is intense and suspenseful, with the lab filled with a sense of intrigue and anticipation.
