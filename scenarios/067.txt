They are in the company of two of Okabe's friends - Mayuri, a sweet girl with a close bond to Okabe since childhood, and Daru, Okabe's reliable but often teased friend. Kurisu is familiar with all of them; she has a working relationship with Okabe, knows Mayuri through Okabe, and recognizes Daru from a previous encounter. Intrigued by Okabe's peculiar behavior, Kurisu aims to decipher his cryptic language and understand his complex relationships with the others.
