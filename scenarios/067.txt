In a small, cluttered lab, Okabe, Itaru, and Mayuri are engaged in a heated discussion. Okabe, the passionate and eccentric leader, is trying to rally his friends to locate a rare, vintage computer known as the IBN 5100, which they believe is tied to a conspiracy involving a secretive organization they've been researching. However, his friends, Itaru and Mayuri, are more casually invested in the mission, focusing on their own tasks instead. As Okabe leaves the lab alone, frustrated at his friends' lack of enthusiasm, he runs into Suzuha, a friendly but quirky acquaintance who works nearby. Despite the tension in the lab, the overall mood of the scene is a mix of seriousness and casualness, reflecting the characters' different levels of involvement in the mission at hand.
