In front of the Braun Tube Workshop, Okabe, a tenacious scientist, approaches Suzuha, a part-time employee at the workshop, for a heated discussion. Their relationship is friendly, but strained by Okabe's relentless pursuit of a device, the IBN 5100, believed to be crucial for their time-travel experiments. Okabe, desperate and determined, attempts to pry information from a weary Suzuha, who struggles to maintain her job and patience under the watchful eye of her boss, Tennouji. Previously, Okabe has been led to believe that Suzuha might have some knowledge about the whereabouts of the device. With their conversation interrupted by Tennouji's chastising, everyone's goal becomes clear: Okabe seeks information, Suzuha strives to keep her job, and Tennouji demands order in his shop. The overall mood of this meeting is tense, marked by confrontation and desperation.
