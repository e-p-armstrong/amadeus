In the bustling city streets near a local store, Okabe Rintaro, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, engages in conversation with Suzuha, an energetic part-time worker at the store. They share a camaraderie built on shared experiences and the anticipation of an impending battle against a powerful organization (SERN) that they oppose. Okabe, in his characteristic dramatic flair, refers to this battle as "Ragnarok," a term he uses to colorfully describe their final stand against SERN. Meanwhile, Mayuri, a high school girl and friend of Okabe, arrives at the scene, blissfully unaffected by the serious conversation and more interested in her lunch choices. As the scene unfolds, Okabe seeks to inspire Suzuha for the upcoming "Ragnarok," Suzuha expresses her readiness to join the battle, and Mayuri remains focused on choosing her meal. The overall mood of the scene is a mix of light-hearted banter, camaraderie, and a tinge of anticipation for the challenges that lie ahead.
