Kurisu finds herself in a lab with her friends, Okabe and Itaru, experimenting with a device they believe can send texts to the past. Kurisu is a valued member of this team, respected for her genius and known for her persistence. However, she is currently in a state of skepticism, questioning Okabe on his unique ability to remember different timelines - an anomaly she's trying to understand. As Okabe teases and challenges her on her reluctance to change the past, Kurisu is driven by a desire to reconcile with her own beliefs and understand the implications of their groundbreaking experiment.
