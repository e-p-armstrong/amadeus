 
In the middle of a bustling city street, Okabe finds himself observing his friend Mayuri, who has developed a peculiar habit of reaching out to the sky at random times. Okabe, who has known Mayuri for quite some time, is both amused and concerned about this unusual behavior. Mayuri, on the other hand, seems to be in a dreamlike state, oblivious to her surroundings and engrossed in her own world. This behavior has been escalating recently, with Mayuri now reaching out to the sky even during their casual outings. Okabe's goal in this scene is to gently remind Mayuri of the dangers of her actions and to bring her back to reality, while Mayuri seems to be content in her own little world, contemplating the unseen stars and deciding on what to have for lunch. The overall mood of the scene is light-hearted, with a slight touch of concern.
