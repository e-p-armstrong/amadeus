Kurisu finds herself in a laboratory alongside her fellow researchers, Okabe and Daru, attempting to conduct a time-altering experiment. Having worked closely with Okabe and Daru for some time, Kurisu is well-acquainted with both of them and their shared aspirations. The experiment they are attempting involves sending a message to the past, which, to their disappointment, fails to change the outcome of a past event. In response to this failure, Kurisu steps in, offering her expertise to help Okabe and Daru understand why their experiment didn't yield the expected results.
