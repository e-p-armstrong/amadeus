 Okabe Rintaro, a self-proclaimed 'mad scientist', and Kurisu, a young genius, are engaged in a tense but humorous conversation in their shared laboratory. They are both invested in a shared experiment involving a device they call the PhoneWave, which they suspect may have time-altering properties. Okabe, caught up in his conspiracy theories about shadowy organizations ruling the world, tries to convince the skeptical Kurisu of his ideas. Kurisu, despite her exasperation with Okabe's eccentricities, is genuinely interested in the progress of their experiment and wants to understand its implications. The air is thick with tension as Okabe struggles to explain his theories and the status of their experiment while dealing with a deluge of emails from a persistent contact, and Kurisu grapples with her skepticism and her growing curiosity about the PhoneWave's potential.
