Plan:
1. Start by describing the current setting - a research lab, where Okabe and Kurisu, along with other lab members, are conducting an experiment.
2. Identify the other characters present in the scene and establish Kurisu's relationship with them.
3. Describe Kurisu's current state - tired and fed-up with the chaotic environment of the lab.
4. Conclude by stating Kurisu's immediate plan - to return to her hotel and leave a task for Okabe.

Scenario:
After spending hours in a cluttered research lab attempting to solve a scientific problem, Kurisu, along with Okabe and a few other lab members, are nearing the end of their experimentation for the day. Kurisu is familiar with everyone present, having worked with them for a while now, although she finds their chaotic working style exasperating. With the lab in disarray and fatigued from the day's work, Kurisu decides she's had enough and announces her intent to leave. Before departing, she reminds Okabe to write a report, hoping he'll get some productive work done in her absence.
