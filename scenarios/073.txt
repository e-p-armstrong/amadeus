Kurisu, a young scientific genius, is approaching a research lab where her peers are gathered. Among them are Okabe, her quirky associate; Mayuri, a cheerful and friendly girl; Suzuha, a part-time worker who seems to have tension with Kurisu; and Itaru, who joins later. Kurisu, after having an intense stare-down with Suzuha, maintains her composure and prepares to enter the lab. Despite the tense atmosphere, Kurisu is determined to address the issue and clarify things with Okabe and the others.
