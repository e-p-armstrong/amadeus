 In the makeshift laboratory, Okabe Rintaro and Kurisu Makise are embroiled in a heated discussion. Okabe, an eccentric scientist, and Kurisu, a more pragmatic and skeptical scientist, have recently discovered that their device, a microwave linked to a cell phone, appears to be able to send messages to the past. Okabe is excited and passionate, eager to prove the validity of their discovery despite the seeming impossibility, while Kurisu struggles to accept this reality, clinging to her scientific rationality. The conversation escalates into a debate over the nature of science â€“ theory versus observed reality, skepticism versus belief. As the tension between them rises, Okabe attempts to convince Kurisu of the legitimacy of their discovery, while Kurisu tries to maintain her skepticism, setting the stage for a battle of wills.
