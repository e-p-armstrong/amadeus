The scene most likely falls after the discovery of the PhoneWave's ability to send messages to the past. The characters present are Okabe Rintaro, the passionate and eccentric scientist who is the driving force behind the lab's research, and Kurisu Makise, a genius scientist who is skeptical about the discovery. Their relationship is one of mutual respect despite frequent arguments, with Okabe's fervor often clashing with Kurisu's rationality.

The current emotional and mental states of each character at the start of the scene would be Okabe's excitement and frustration, eager to prove his discovery but frustrated with Kurisu's skepticism. Kurisu, on the other hand, is doubtful and resistant, refusing to believe their makeshift device could achieve time travel.

Significant events leading up to this scene include the discovery of their device's ability to send messages to the past. This scene appears to be a heated debate between Okabe and Kurisu, arguing over the validity of their discovery and the nature of scientific theory versus observed reality.

Steins;Gate-specific terms that may need some explaining: The "PhoneWave" is a microwave linked to a cell phone, discovered to have the ability to send messages to the past.

Okabe's goal in this scene would be to convince Kurisu of the legitimacy of their discovery, while Kurisu is trying to maintain her skepticism and rationality in the face of a seemingly impossible phenomenon. 

The overall mood of the scene is tense and argumentative, with the conflict between belief and skepticism at its heart.

Scenario: In the makeshift laboratory, Okabe Rintaro and Kurisu Makise are embroiled in a heated discussion. Okabe, an eccentric scientist, and Kurisu, a more pragmatic and skeptical scientist, have recently discovered that their device, a microwave linked to a cell phone, appears to be able to send messages to the past. Okabe is excited and passionate, eager to prove the validity of their discovery despite the seeming impossibility, while Kurisu struggles to accept this reality, clinging to her scientific rationality. The conversation escalates into a debate over the nature of science â€“ theory versus observed reality, skepticism versus belief. As the tension between them rises, Okabe attempts to convince Kurisu of the legitimacy of their discovery, while Kurisu tries to maintain her skepticism, setting the stage for a battle of wills.
