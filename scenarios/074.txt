 In a research lab, Okabe and Kurisu, two colleagues, are deep in discussion about their latest finding, a phenomenon that supposedly allows them to send emails to the past. Their personalities clash; Okabe, the passionate and eager scientist, and Kurisu, the serious and cautious one, who hesitates to embark on this research because of her father's downfall due to his obsession with time travel. A device called the "PhoneWave," presumably used for this time-altering communication, is a point of contention between them. Okabe wants to explore this phenomenon further, whereas Kurisu is adamant about staying away from it, fearing the consequences that befell her father. The atmosphere is thick with tension as Okabe tries to sway Kurisu, and she stands her ground, leading to a heated debate about the future of their research.
