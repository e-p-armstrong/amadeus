Plan:
1. Describe the setting: a casual gathering at a lab, where Kurisu, Okabe, and Mayuri are present. The group is in the process of experimenting with a device that can send messages to the past.
2. Mention the relationships between Kurisu, Okabe, and Mayuri. Kurisu is new to the group and unfamiliar with Mayuri's personality, while Okabe is an old friend of Mayuri's and used to her quirks.
3. Describe what they are trying to do: The group is brainstorming ideas for a simple past event that they can change using their device. Kurisu is actively participating in the brainstorming.
4. Indicate Kurisu's feelings: She is intrigued by the experiment but also slightly bemused by Mayuri's eccentricities.

Scenario:
In a cluttered lab, Kurisu finds herself amidst an unusual brainstorming session. She's joined by Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, and Mayuri, a carefree and somewhat ditzy girl who's a longtime friend of Okabe's. The trio is trying to come up with a simple past event to alter using their experimental device that can send messages to the past. Kurisu, still new to the group and somewhat perplexed by Mayuri's whimsical attitude, is actively participating in the discussion, aiming to guide the team towards a practical experiment.
