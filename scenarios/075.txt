Kurisu finds herself in the midst of a planned experiment, where they intend to send a message back in time, at their shared laboratory. Along with her are Okabe, a fellow scientist with a peculiar personality, Mayuri, a cheerful and kind-hearted friend, Itaru, a tech genius also known as Daru, and Moeka, a shy woman who is a new member of their lab. Kurisu knows all of them well, having spent considerable time working together on time-travel experiments. As they prepare for the experiment, Kurisu takes up the role of ensuring the content of the message sent back is safe and won't cause any paradoxes, a task that involves convincing Okabe and the others about the potential risks.
