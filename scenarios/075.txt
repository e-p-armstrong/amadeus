 In the midst of their shared lab space, Okabe, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist", finds himself deep in conversation with Kurisu, a genius scientist who has been working alongside him. Despite their frequent banter, their bond is undeniable, forged in the crucible of shared experiences and the discovery of their makeshift time machine, the "Phone Microwave". Okabe is clearly unsettled, his mind plagued by a disturbing hallucination of Kurisu's death, which he is unable to shake off. The tension between them is palpable as they discuss this vision; Okabe seeking understanding, while Kurisu, in her usual curt manner, tries to offer logical explanations and reassurances. The atmosphere is thick with confusion and concern, as they grapple with the inexplicable and its possible implications.
