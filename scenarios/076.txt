Kurisu, Okabe, and their friends are in a makeshift laboratory, experimenting with a device that they believe can alter timelines. With them are Daru, a skilled hacker; Mayuri, Okabe's childhood friend; and Moeka, a quiet, introverted woman who Okabe calls 'Shining Finger'. Kurisu knows these people well, as they're all members of the same research group. The group is attempting to send a message to Moeka's phone in the past, a risky experiment with the potential to change reality. Kurisu, as the most experienced scientist among them, is trying to ensure that everything goes according to plan, and is keeping a close eye on Okabe as he begins the process.
