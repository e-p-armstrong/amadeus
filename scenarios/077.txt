In the bustling café known as MayQueen, Okabe, a determined young man, finds himself trying to extract a crucial piece of information from his whimsical friend, Mayuri, who works there as a maid. Despite their contrasting personalities—Okabe's serious nature against Mayuri's carefree demeanor—they share a strong bond of friendship. Okabe, currently on a mission to locate an old computer model known as the IBN 5100, is desperate for any leads, while Mayuri, blissfully unaware of his urgency, is excited to share a piece of news with him. As Okabe grapples with his impatience, Mayuri, donning her maid uniform, teases him about the surprise she has in store, placing her work duties on the back burner. In this tense yet playful exchange, Okabe is striving to push forward in his research and Mayuri is aiming to lighten his burden, setting the scene for a mixture of urgency and lightheartedness.
