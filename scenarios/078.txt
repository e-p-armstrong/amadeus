In a local eatery, lab members and friends Okabe and Mayuri are sharing a meal, discussing their ongoing experiment with a homemade device that can send messages to the past. Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is desperately seeking information about a vintage computer, the IBN 5100, which can help them with their experiments. Mayuri, his childhood friend and lab member, casually suggests that Faris, a mutual friend and retro PC enthusiast, might know something. Faris is a spirited young woman who works as a waitress at MayQueen, a local maid café. 

As Mayuri munches on her chicken, somewhat distressed that Okabe took two pieces, Okabe decides to make contact with Faris, despite his initial hesitation. He gives Mayuri instructions on what to do if he doesn't return, indicating the severity of their situation, and leaves for the café. The atmosphere is a mix of tension and humor, reflecting Okabe's seriousness about his mission and Mayuri's light-hearted nature. The scene transitions to the bustling MayQueen café, where Faris greets Okabe with her usual flamboyance, oblivious to his mission's gravity. 

The goal of the scene is for Okabe to acquire information about the IBN 5100 from Faris, while Mayuri stays back at the eatery, continuing her meal. The overall mood of the scene is a blend of suspense, humor, and intrigue.
