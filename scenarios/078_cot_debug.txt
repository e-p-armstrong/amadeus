Brainstorm:
The scene likely falls somewhere in the middle of the timeline, after Okabe and his friends have discovered the potential of the "Phone Microwave" (a prototype time machine that sends texts to the past), but before SERN's raid. The characters present in the scene are Okabe, Mayuri, and Faris. Okabe is seeking information about the IBN 5100, a retro PC that holds significance to their time travel experiments. Mayuri, Okabe's childhood friend and a member of his lab, gives him a lead, suggesting that Faris might know something. Faris is a friend who is also a retro PC enthusiast and a waitress at the local maid cafe, MayQueen.

The relationships between the characters are friendly, but Okabe's interaction with Faris is marked with a sense of caution and intrigue. Okabe is in a desperate quest for knowledge and is ready to take risks while Mayuri is more laid back and concerned about her chicken. Faris, on the other hand, is playful and nonchalant.

The mood of the scene is tense, with an undertone of humor and intrigue.

Scenario:
In a local eatery, lab members and friends Okabe and Mayuri are sharing a meal, discussing their ongoing experiment with a homemade device that can send messages to the past. Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is desperately seeking information about a vintage computer, the IBN 5100, which can help them with their experiments. Mayuri, his childhood friend and lab member, casually suggests that Faris, a mutual friend and retro PC enthusiast, might know something. Faris is a spirited young woman who works as a waitress at MayQueen, a local maid café. 

As Mayuri munches on her chicken, somewhat distressed that Okabe took two pieces, Okabe decides to make contact with Faris, despite his initial hesitation. He gives Mayuri instructions on what to do if he doesn't return, indicating the severity of their situation, and leaves for the café. The atmosphere is a mix of tension and humor, reflecting Okabe's seriousness about his mission and Mayuri's light-hearted nature. The scene transitions to the bustling MayQueen café, where Faris greets Okabe with her usual flamboyance, oblivious to his mission's gravity. 

The goal of the scene is for Okabe to acquire information about the IBN 5100 from Faris, while Mayuri stays back at the eatery, continuing her meal. The overall mood of the scene is a blend of suspense, humor, and intrigue.
