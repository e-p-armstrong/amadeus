In a bustling room filled with enthusiastic participants and spectators, a strategic game tournament - reminiscent of chess- is in full swing. The main characters, Okabe, Daru, Mayuri, and Faris, are all present, engaged in friendly but competitive banter. Faris, a renowned player, swiftly moves from table to table, dominating her opponents, while Okabe and Daru watch her in awe and a hint of rivalry. Mayuri, on the other hand, is more interested in the game's popular mascot character, Upa, and the global popularity of the game. As Faris continues to triumph, Okabe and Mayuri discuss the game's appeal and Faris's unmatched skill. The mood is upbeat but charged with competition and unspoken challenges.
