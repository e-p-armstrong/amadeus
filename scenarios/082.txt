In Faris's bustling cafe, a spirited game tournament is in full swing, with the participants being Okabe, a self-proclaimed 'mad scientist', his supportive friends Mayuri and Itaru, and the cafe owner, Faris. Okabe, typically confident and theatrical, has entered this game of strategy he's unfamiliar with, intending to use it as a tool rather than a challenge to win. His friends, Itaru and Mayuri, cheer him on, their hope and excitement palpable in the charged atmosphere. The cafe's owner, Faris, is not just their host but their formidable opponent, her playful competitiveness adding to the tension. Amidst the game's high stakes, Okabe's true goal is to coax Faris into sharing some valuable information, a victory that doesn't require him to master the game. The scene is a lively mix of tension, excitement, and friendly rivalry, as Okabe's unorthodox strategy unfolds.
