In a casual gathering at their shared workspace, Okabe, Kurisu, and friends are discussing the use and secrecy of an important invention, the PhoneWave. Luka, a shy and introverted friend, and Mayuri, a cheerful and enthusiastic companion, are both keen to become part of this inventive team. Kurisu, who is already a member of this group, has a good understanding of these individuals, their idiosyncrasies, and their shared passion for invention. However, feeling exhausted from her involvement in the lab's activities, Kurisu tries to pass her responsibilities to Luka, in a bid to step back from this intense inventive environment.
