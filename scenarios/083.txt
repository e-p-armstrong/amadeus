At a social gathering, Okabe, the eccentric scientist, is in deep conversation with Faris, a charismatic figure with a penchant for role-playing as a catgirl. Faris, surrounded by her adoring fans, is playing coy about her knowledge of a vintage computer, the IBN 5100, which Okabe is desperately trying to locate. Okabe's friends, Mayuri and Itaru, are also present, their innocent remarks unintentionally complicating the situation. The atmosphere is fraught with tension as Okabe, using a mix of intimidation and theatrics, attempts to pry information from Faris. Meanwhile, Faris, seemingly enjoying the power she holds over the situation, uses her popularity to maintain her upper hand, leaving Okabe on the defensive. The overall mood of the scene is intense and dramatic, with an undercurrent of humor due to the eccentricities of the characters involved.
