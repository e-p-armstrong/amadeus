 
In the tech-centric district of Akihabara, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is engaged in a fruitless search for an elusive piece of vintage technology, an IBN 5100, with the reticent Moeka. Moeka, known for her constant texting, is one of the lab members of Okabe's Future Gadget Laboratory, but her lack of useful information about the IBN 5100 is causing Okabe's patience to wear thin. Okabe, in his eccentric alter-ego, Hououin Kyouma, promises to find the PC, hoping to instill some confidence in Moeka. Amidst this quest, Okabe receives a call from the cheerful Mayuri, another lab member, and good-natured Itaru, who reveal a promising lead about the IBN 5100's location. The overall mood of the scene is a blend of frustration and hope: Okabe's frustration with the ongoing, seemingly fruitless search, and the newfound hope from the potential lead on the IBN 5100's whereabouts.
