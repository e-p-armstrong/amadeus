The scene unfolds in the bustling city of Akihabara, where Okabe Rintarou, a scientist driven by curiosity and ambition, finds himself on the trail of a coveted piece of technology â€” an old computer model known as the IBN 5100. His close friend and fellow scientist, Hashida Itaru or 'Daru', is currently at a gaming event, the Faris Cup, where a common acquaintance, Faris, is present. Faris had once donated a similar computer to a local shrine, making her the key to locating the device. As Okabe plans to investigate the shrines in the area, he receives an unexpected call that triggers his paranoia, leading him to suspect that he's being targeted by a secretive organization that might be threatened by his work. The scene is laden with anticipation as Okabe prepares to follow this promising lead, while also dealing with the tension of possible external threats. Meanwhile, Kurisu Makise, another scientist who often finds herself in the whirlwind of Okabe's ambitious projects, makes a surprise entry into the scene through a phone call, adding another layer of complexity to the unfolding situation.
