 Okabe, a suspicious and eccentric individual, finds himself at Yanabayashi Shrine, confronted by Kurisu - a genius scientist who he's reluctantly taken under his wing - and Luka, a gentle soul dressed in traditional garb. Kurisu, frustrated yet intrigued by Okabe's eccentricities, has followed him here after a recent discussion about a rare computer, the IBN 5100, and a powerful organization, SERN, allegedly conducting unethical time travel research. Okabe is on the hunt for this computer, his defensive and paranoid nature keeping him on edge, wary of Kurisu whom he suspects of being a spy. Kurisu, on the other hand, is trying to understand Okabe's wild allegations and their implications, driven by her scientific curiosity. The scene is charged with tension, a brewing storm of confrontation and revelation.
