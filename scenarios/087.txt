 
In a laboratory, Kurisu and Okabe have just completed an experiment with a machine they've built. Also present in the lab are Mayuri and Lukako, who are both friends with Kurisu but not directly involved in the scientific work. Kurisu, a young genius scientist, and Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, have a complex relationship marked by frequent clashes in personality and approach to their research. After the experiment, Kurisu is puzzled and slightly irritated by Okabe's unexpected reaction. She is trying to figure out what Okabe is referring to when he mentions the experiment not working as planned.
