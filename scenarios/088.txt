 At the traditional Urushibara Shrine, Okabe and Kurisu, two passionate scientists, are visiting Luka, a young shrine assistant. Their relationship is one of camaraderie and playful banter, with a layer of respect for their scientific pursuits. Okabe, typically eccentric, is trying to pique Luka's interest in an imagined threat while Kurisu, pragmatic and assertive, demands a proper introduction. Luka, innocent and polite, is caught in their lively debate, slightly flustered by the confrontation. Okabe's goal is to discuss an important matter with Luka's father, while Kurisu is trying to establish her presence and identity. The overall mood of the scene is light-hearted with an undertone of urgency, as Okabe prepares to discuss something he labels as grave, concerning the future of mankind.
