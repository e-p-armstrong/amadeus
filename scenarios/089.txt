 

In the tranquil setting of Yanabayashi Shrine, eccentric scientist Okabe, his brilliant but exasperated colleague Kurisu, and the gentle shrine maiden Luka, find themselves in a lively exchange with Luka's father. Okabe's relationship with the others is characterized by his eccentric behavior, to which Kurisu responds with a mix of annoyance and concern, while Luka looks on nervously. Okabe is actively seeking a piece of vintage technology, known as the IBN 5100, crucial to their research, while Kurisu supports him despite her reservations. Amidst the playful banter and misunderstandings, Luka's father reveals that the coveted technology was indeed entrusted to the shrine years ago. Okabe's goal is to secure this crucial piece of technology, while Kurisu attempts to navigate the situation without causing too much disruption, and Luka's father simply wishes to maintain the peace. The overall mood is light-hearted but underlined by a sense of urgency and tension due to Okabe's mission.
