Kurisu finds herself in a lively debate about time travel technology in a makeshift lab filled with passionate, if somewhat eccentric, young individuals. Among them are Okabe, the self-proclaimed mad scientist and leader of the group, Mayuri, a cheerful girl with a fondness for cosplay, and Itaru, a genius hacker and reliable source of comic relief. Despite their contrasting personalities, Kurisu, a highly intelligent and serious researcher, has built a bond with them through their shared interest in the mysteries of time. In this discussion, Kurisu is trying to inject a dose of reality into their dreams of innovation, highlighting the need for resources and expertise beyond what they currently possess, in order to progress their time travel project.
