In a dusty alleyway behind an electronics store, Okabe and Kurisu, two colleagues who share a playful yet argumentative relationship, are struggling to carry an antique computer, known as the IBN 5100, up to their lab. This device is a major breakthrough in their time-traveling research due to its rare computing capabilities. As they haul their valuable find, they debate with familiar bickering, Okabe often exaggerating his physical discomfort to lighten the mood. Suddenly, Suzuha, an acquaintance who works part-time at the electronics store, stumbles upon them and becomes curious about their find. The scene starts off light-hearted, but the mood drastically shifts when Suzuha, for unknown reasons, confronts Kurisu with a suspicious glare, leaving an air of tension hanging between them.
