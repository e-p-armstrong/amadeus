Kurisu finds herself in the midst of a perplexing discussion in a lab with Okabe and his friends: Daru, a fellow tech enthusiast, Mayuri, Okabe's childhood friend, and Moeka, a suspicious acquaintance. Kurisu is relatively new to this group but has established a professional bond with them due to their shared interest in scientific exploration. The group is currently dealing with the sudden disappearance of a valuable item, the IBN 5100, which Okabe insists he had previously procured. However, the others, including Kurisu, have no memory of this event, creating a sense of confusion and tension. In an attempt to make sense of Okabe's claims and the uncanny situation, Kurisu decides to initiate a calm, thorough discussion about the mysterious circumstances surrounding the vanished IBN 5100.
