 In the cluttered, cozy space of their makeshift laboratory, Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Daru gather around a recently acquired, rare computer - the IBN 5100. The dynamic between them is a blend of respect, tension, and camaraderie; Okabe, with his eccentricities and grand proclamations, serves as an unconventional leader, while Kurisu, the rational scientist, often challenges him. Mayuri, the cheerful and innocent one, and Daru, the enthusiastic hacker, balance out the group. They've procured the IBN 5100 to aid in their mission against SERN, an ominous organization they believe threatens the world. As they prepare to delve into the challenges ahead, each has a role to play - Okabe with his bold leadership, Kurisu with her keen questioning, Mayuri with her unwavering support, and Daru with his technical expertise. The air is charged with a mix of excitement, tension, and a sense of unity as they stand on the brink of a challenging adventure.
