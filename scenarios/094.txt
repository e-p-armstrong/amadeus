In the tranquil setting of a shrine's courtyard, Okabe, a dedicated researcher, encounters Luka, a timid boy known for his unusual attire of traditional female garments, who is busy sweeping the courtyard. Okabe, who often guides Luka, advises him about a weapon he should always carry while he also prepares to discuss a serious matter with Luka's father. Prior to this meeting, Okabe has been on a mission to find an old computer, crucial for his secretive research plans. As Luka rushes to fetch his father, Okabe's goal becomes clear: he needs to convince Luka's father to lend him an old computer entrusted to the shrine, without revealing his plans of hacking into a powerful, mysterious organization. The scene is a blend of seriousness, underscored by Okabe's intent, and light-hearted humor, brought about by Luka's naive reactions and Okabe's eccentric persona.
