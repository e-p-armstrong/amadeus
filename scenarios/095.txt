In a quiet shrine not far from their lab, the eccentric scientist Okabe and his timid friend Luka find themselves tasked with the arduous job of transporting a heavy, vintage computer, the IBM 5100. Okabe, the determined yet exasperated leader, and Luka, a shy follower, share a bond built on shared adventures and a common goal. Okabe, despite suffering from an unexpected wrist pain, is eager to get the computer to the lab, while Luka, anxious and self-doubting, is worried about his ability to help. The IBM 5100, a crucial component for their time travel experiments, is bulky and heavy, presenting a physical challenge that adds to their mental stress. Their goal is to transport this valuable equipment to their lab without causing any damage, navigating physical pain and self-doubt. The mood is tense, with a touch of humor, as they bicker and boost each other's spirits, struggling with the weight of their task, both literally and metaphorically.
