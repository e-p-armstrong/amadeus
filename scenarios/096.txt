In the dimly lit science lab, eccentric leader Okabe Rintaro and his shy protégé Luka arrive, exhausted from a gruelling journey to retrieve a mysterious object from a shrine. They are greeted by the waiting members of their team: Kurisu, Okabe's intellectual rival whose curiosity is piqued by their arrival; Mayuri, Okabe's cheerful childhood friend; and Suzuha, a focused ally who is intrigued by their mission but concerned about the noise they're making. Okabe and Luka have just returned from a long journey to retrieve a crucial object for their mission, a mysterious piece of technology known as the "IBN 5100." Okabe seeks help in carrying the heavy item upstairs, Luka is eager to continue serving Okabe, Kurisu desires to understand their purpose, Mayuri is excited to be part of the group, and Suzuha wants to maintain a low profile while investigating the item. The overall mood is a blend of exhaustion, triumph, curiosity, and mild irritation as the team regroups to tackle their next challenge.
