 Okabe, Kurisu, Suzuha, Mayuri, Luka, and Daru find themselves in the Future Gadget Laboratory, a humble abode filled with discarded tech and dreams of time travel. Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Daru form the core of this makeshift lab, their bond solidified through shared experiences and a shared sense of curiosity. As Okabe announces his acquisition of the vintage computer, the IBM 5100, Suzuha, a part-time worker at a nearby workshop, reacts unexpectedly, her gaze locked onto Kurisu with an unsettling intensity. This moment of tension is quickly dispelled as the team embarks on the physical task of moving the heavy IBM 5100 into the lab, their chatter lighthearted despite the strain. Their goal is simple – get the computer into the lab, a crucial step in their time travel research – but the unspoken tension from Suzuha's reaction, and the underlying fear of a rival entity, SERN, conducting its own time travel research, lends a hint of suspense to the otherwise upbeat scene.
