This scene likely falls somewhere in the middle of the timeline, after Kurisu has joined the lab and the team has begun their experiments with time travel, but before they've attracted the attention of SERN. The characters present are Okabe, Kurisu, Suzuha, Mayuri, Luka, and Daru. Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Daru are part of the Future Gadget Laboratory team, while Suzuha is an outsider who works at the nearby Braun Tube Workshop, and Luka is a friend of Mayuri's. The scene starts with Okabe announcing that he's acquired an IBM 5100, a vintage computer that they hope can help them with their time travel research. Suzuha reacts strangely to their conversation, especially to Kurisu. The significant event leading up to the scene is Okabe's acquisition of the IBM 5100, and the events during the scene are the team's attempts to move the IBM 5100 into the lab, and their subsequent conversation. SERN is a research organization that the team fears may be conducting its own time travel research. The overall mood of the scene is upbeat, with a touch of tension and confusion due to Suzuha's behavior.

Scenario: Okabe, Kurisu, Suzuha, Mayuri, Luka, and Daru find themselves in the Future Gadget Laboratory, a humble abode filled with discarded tech and dreams of time travel. Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Daru form the core of this makeshift lab, their bond solidified through shared experiences and a shared sense of curiosity. As Okabe announces his acquisition of the vintage computer, the IBM 5100, Suzuha, a part-time worker at a nearby workshop, reacts unexpectedly, her gaze locked onto Kurisu with an unsettling intensity. This moment of tension is quickly dispelled as the team embarks on the physical task of moving the heavy IBM 5100 into the lab, their chatter lighthearted despite the strain. Their goal is simple – get the computer into the lab, a crucial step in their time travel research – but the unspoken tension from Suzuha's reaction, and the underlying fear of a rival entity, SERN, conducting its own time travel research, lends a hint of suspense to the otherwise upbeat scene.
