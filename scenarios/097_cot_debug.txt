Plan:
1. Firstly, describe the setting - an experiment involving the PhoneWave is about to commence.
2. Mention the other characters present in the scene - Daru, Faris, and Mayuri - and describe them as Okabe's friends.
3. Describe Kurisu's relationship with the other characters - she knows them well since they are all part of the same group.
4. Convey Kurisu's current state - she is impatiently waiting for Okabe to start the experiment.
5. Conclude by stating what Kurisu is trying to do - get Okabe to start the experiment.

Scenario:
Due to a series of events, Kurisu finds herself in the midst of an experiment involving a peculiar device called the PhoneWave. She is accompanied by Okabe's friends - Daru, a computer enthusiast; Faris, a playful and mysterious girl; and Mayuri, a kind-hearted and naive friend of Okabe. Being part of the same group, Kurisu knows them all well and is familiar with their quirks. As the preparations for the experiment drag on, Kurisu grows increasingly impatient. She's trying to get Okabe to start the experiment, but her attempts are met with Okabe's indecisiveness and distractions.
