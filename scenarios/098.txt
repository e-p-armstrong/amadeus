 

In a lab bustling with activity, Okabe, Kurisu, Itaru, Mayuri, and Luka are gathered around an antiquated device known as the IBN 5100. Okabe, a self-proclaimed 'mad scientist,' is explaining his plan to use the device in a 'war' against SERN, a supposed research institution he believes to be a threat. Kurisu, skeptical of Okabe's insistence about SERN's malevolence, seeks to understand his intentions and the legality of his actions. Itaru, a hacker and a trusted friend of Okabe, is busy trying to operate the IBN 5100 while juggling other tasks as per Okabe's instructions. Meanwhile, Mayuri and Luka, less involved in the scientific aspect, provide moral support and a sense of normalcy amidst the tense atmosphere. The scene is brimming with suspense and urgency as the characters navigate the complexities of their situation, each with their own goals and perspectives.
