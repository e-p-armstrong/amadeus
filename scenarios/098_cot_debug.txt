Plan:
1. Start by describing the setting - a casual gathering at a location where Kurisu and colleagues are having a conversation.
2. Introduce the other characters present at the scene - Mayuri, Lukako, and Okabe - and describe Kurisu's relation to them.
3. Describe the ongoing conversation - they are discussing their plans for the summer and sharing a photo album.
4. State Kurisu's current state - she is disinterested in the ongoing conversation, more interested in her book but is still aware of the discussion around her.
5. Conclude by stating Kurisu's intention - to keep her distance from the conversation but still contribute when necessary.

Scenario:
Kurisu finds herself in the middle of a casual gathering, where her colleagues, Okabe, Mayuri, and Lukako, are eagerly discussing their summer plans and sharing a cosplay photo album. Mayuri and Lukako, whom Kurisu knows quite well from their shared time at the lab, are both high schoolers who share a love for cosplay, while Okabe is the eccentric and argumentative leader of their group. The conversation revolves around the book, cosplay, and potential beach trip, but Kurisu, engrossed in her own English book, remains mostly detached from their enthusiastic chatter. Despite her disinterest, she remains aware of the conversation, occasionally giving curt responses. As the discussion progresses, she intends to maintain this distance but contribute to the conversation when absolutely necessary.
