 In a lab filled with the hum of computers and other scientific equipment, three researchers — Okabe, a self-styled 'mad scientist', his friend and expert hacker Itaru, and the newly-joined genius scientist Kurisu — are deep in a discussion about a potential scientific conspiracy. They've uncovered evidence that SERN, a reputable scientific organization, has been secretly researching time travel using a particle accelerator known as the LHC. Okabe, filled with excitement and a hint of paranoia, is trying to convince the skeptical Kurisu of the conspiracy, while Itaru, confident in his hacking skills, provides the technical details. Amid this intense discussion, Okabe is frequently interrupted by emails on his phone, further raising the tension in the room. Each character is driven by their own goal: Okabe to expose the conspiracy, Kurisu to see solid proof before believing such a claim, and Itaru to delve deeper into SERN's secrets. The mood of the scene is suspenseful, filled with the thrill of unraveling secrets and the looming risk of getting caught.
