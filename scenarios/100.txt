In the aftermath of an event where the past was altered, Kurisu finds herself in a room with Okabe, her eccentric colleague, and their mutual friends, Mayuri and Itaru. Okabe is passionately explaining his ability to perceive changes in time, while the others, including the innocent Mayuri and the tech-savvy Itaru, are trying to understand his theories. Kurisu knows all of them well, having spent a significant amount of time working together in the lab. Finding Okabe's claims hard to digest and his language flamboyant, she remains skeptical and a bit irritated. Kurisu is trying to make Okabe explain his theories logically, without resorting to fantastical terms or grandiose descriptions.
