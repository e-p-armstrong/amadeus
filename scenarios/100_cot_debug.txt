Brainstorming Phase:
1. Location: Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru are in a lab.
2. Relationships: Okabe and Itaru are friends and fellow researchers. Kurisu is a genius scientist who recently joined them.
3. Emotional states: Okabe is excited and conspiratorial, Kurisu is skeptical but interested, and Itaru is confident and a bit annoyed by Okabe's antics.
4. Events: They have discovered that SERN, a major scientific organization, is secretly researching time travel. Itaru has hacked into SERN, and they're discussing the evidence they found.
5. Goals: Okabe wants to convince Kurisu of the conspiracy, Kurisu wants proof, and Itaru aims to provide that proof by infiltrating SERN's database further.
6. Mood: The mood is intense and suspenseful.
7. Special terms: SERN is a scientific organization, LHC is a particle accelerator, and the IBN 5100 is a rare, old computer.

Scenario: In a lab filled with the hum of computers and other scientific equipment, three researchers — Okabe, a self-styled 'mad scientist', his friend and expert hacker Itaru, and the newly-joined genius scientist Kurisu — are deep in a discussion about a potential scientific conspiracy. They've uncovered evidence that SERN, a reputable scientific organization, has been secretly researching time travel using a particle accelerator known as the LHC. Okabe, filled with excitement and a hint of paranoia, is trying to convince the skeptical Kurisu of the conspiracy, while Itaru, confident in his hacking skills, provides the technical details. Amid this intense discussion, Okabe is frequently interrupted by emails on his phone, further raising the tension in the room. Each character is driven by their own goal: Okabe to expose the conspiracy, Kurisu to see solid proof before believing such a claim, and Itaru to delve deeper into SERN's secrets. The mood of the scene is suspenseful, filled with the thrill of unraveling secrets and the looming risk of getting caught.
