In their shared lab space, Kurisu, Okabe, Mayuri, and Luka are holding a strategy meeting about welcoming their friend Suzuha back. Kurisu is familiar with all of them, particularly Okabe, with whom she frequently clashes due to their different views on scientific ethics. She isn't as close with Mayuri or Luka, but treats them with kindness and respect. Currently, she is frustrated with Okabe's proposal to follow Suzuha, considering it an intrusion on Suzuha's privacy. Her objective is to convince Okabe to drop his plan and instead help her and the others prepare a warm welcome for Suzuha.
