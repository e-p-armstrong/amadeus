In the cluttered confines of their makeshift laboratory, Okabe and Kurisu are preparing to conduct an experiment with a modified microwave, which they whimsically refer to as the "PhoneWave." The two scientists, despite their frequent disagreements and differing personalities, are united in their pursuit of understanding the unusual phenomenon they have observed. Okabe, an eccentric and passionate scientist, attempts to lighten the mood with his grandiose statements and odd sense of humor, while Kurisu, a more serious and focused individual, is keen on keeping their work on track. They had previously observed a banana they microwaved seemingly revert to its original state and return to its original location, and are now trying to reproduce this surprising result. The mood is a mix of tension and anticipation, as they attempt to unravel the mysteries of their peculiar appliance.
