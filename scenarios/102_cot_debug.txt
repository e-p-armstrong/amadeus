The scenario most likely takes place early on in the series, after Kurisu has joined Okabe's lab but before their time travel experiments have fully developed. The characters present are Okabe, the eccentric lead, and Kurisu, a new member of the lab and a fellow scientist. Their relationship is somewhat strained, with Okabe's eccentricities often running against Kurisu's more serious demeanor, though a certain camaraderie is still present due to their shared scientific interests. The key event leading up to this scene is Kurisu joining the lab and the two scientists beginning to experiment with a microwave that they suspect may have time-travel capabilities. Here, they are attempting to reproduce a previous phenomenon where a banana they microwaved appeared to change state and return to its original place.

Planning:

1. Location: Okabe's lab, the Future Gadget Laboratory
2. Characters: Okabe Rintaro and Kurisu Makise
3. Relationships: They are both scientists and recent collaborators, though their relationship is somewhat strained due to Okabe's eccentric personality.
4. Emotional state: Okabe is excited and a little over-the-top, Kurisu is serious and focused.
5. Significant events: Kurisu has recently joined the lab, and they are beginning to experiment with a microwave they suspect may be a time machine.
6. Goals: Okabe wishes to prove that the microwave is a time machine, while Kurisu wishes to understand the phenomenon they previously observed.
7. Mood: The scene is somewhat tense but also filled with a sense of scientific excitement and discovery.
8. Special terms: The "PhoneWave" is their name for the microwave they are experimenting with.

Scenario:

In the cluttered confines of their makeshift laboratory, Okabe and Kurisu are preparing to conduct an experiment with a modified microwave, which they whimsically refer to as the "PhoneWave." The two scientists, despite their frequent disagreements and differing personalities, are united in their pursuit of understanding the unusual phenomenon they have observed. Okabe, an eccentric and passionate scientist, attempts to lighten the mood with his grandiose statements and odd sense of humor, while Kurisu, a more serious and focused individual, is keen on keeping their work on track. They had previously observed a banana they microwaved seemingly revert to its original state and return to its original location, and are now trying to reproduce this surprising result. The mood is a mix of tension and anticipation, as they attempt to unravel the mysteries of their peculiar appliance.
