In the lab, Okabe and his friends, Itaru, Mayuri, and Luka, are gathering and preparing something after a canceled meet-up. Kurisu, who has grown close to these lab members, is also present. Itaru is upset over missing an important event due to the gathering, and despite Okabe's attempts to smooth things over, Itaru remains frustrated. Kurisu, wanting to understand the conflict better, engages in the conversation and even offers to help with the preparations, trying to maintain harmony in the group and diffuse Itaru's frustration.
