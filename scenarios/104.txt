 In a small science lab cluttered with equipment, Okabe and Kurisu are working late into the night on a project they call the PhoneWave, a device capable of sending messages into the past. Okabe, the eccentric leader of the lab, and Kurisu, a genius scientist who recently joined the team, share a professional yet friendly relationship, often working together into the late hours. Amidst their work, they take a break to eat and their conversation turns personal, with Okabe probing into Kurisu's living situation and family background. Despite Kurisu's reluctance, Okabe persists, trying to understand and address any personal issues that might be affecting their work. The scene is filled with a sense of curiosity and tension, a quiet moment of personal exchange amidst their intense scientific endeavor.
