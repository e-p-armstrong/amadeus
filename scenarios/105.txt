 In the cramped, cluttered space of a makeshift lab, friends and scientific collaborators Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru (Daru) are neck-deep in an intense investigation. The trio is trying to uncover the secrets of a powerful organization, known as SERN, that is rumored to be conducting illicit research on time travel. The situation is tense, as Kurisu, a genius scientist, is upset with Okabe, the eccentric group leader, for making an insensitive joke about her family issues. Amidst this, Itaru, their skilled hacker, has successfully infiltrated a server, causing a ripple of excitement. As Kurisu battles her emotions, Okabe tries to maintain group morale, and Itaru dives into the newly accessed information, the lab buzzes with a mix of tension, exhilaration, and a shared determination to expose the truth.
