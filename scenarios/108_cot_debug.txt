Scenario: 
In the confines of a makeshift lab, friends and scientific collaborators, Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru, known as Daru, gather around a startling discovery they've made. They've been working on a project related to time travel and recently found out that a reputable organization, referred to as SERN, is also secretly conducting related research. Their excitement quickly morphs into fear and anxiety when they come across a cryptic reference to a "Jellyman’s Report," suggesting possible human experimentation. Okabe, worried for their safety, suggests backing out, especially urging Kurisu, a brilliant scientist with a promising future, to distance herself from the dangerous path they seem to be on. Kurisu, however, is adamant about exposing the truth, while Daru, confident in his hacking skills, is prepared to delve deeper into the mystery. The mood is tense, the air thick with suspense as they stand on the precipice of a reality they might not be prepared for.
