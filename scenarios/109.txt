In the confines of a scientific lab, three friends and researchers - Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru - are about to embark on a mission to uncover the secrets hidden in a mysterious document known as the Jellyman's report. The trio, bound together by their shared interest in science and time travel experiments, are full of nervous anticipation. Okabe, the self-proclaimed mad scientist, initiates the operation, while Itaru, a skilled hacker, breaks through the security layers to access the report. As the tension mounts, the genius scientist Kurisu begins to read out the chilling contents of the report which suggests an experiment involving a human subject who was gelified, a term referring to a failed time travel attempt that turned the subject into a jelly-like state. With every word read, the air in the lab thickens with dread, and the friends find themselves grappling with the harsh realities and potential dangers of their research.
