Plan:
1. Start by describing the setting - Kurisu and Okabe are in a lab discussing the development of a time leap machine.
2. Describe the relationship between Kurisu and Okabe - they are partners in a project with Okabe being the leader and Kurisu handling the technical aspects. 
3. Mention the absence of other characters, Mayuri and Daru, who are members of the same lab and close acquaintances of Kurisu and Okabe.
4. Describe Kurisu's current state - she's deep in thought and worried about the implications of their project.
5. Conclude by stating Kurisu's intention - to discuss her personal issues with Okabe.

Scenario:
After a breakthrough in their project, Kurisu and Okabe find themselves alone in a lab, discussing the development of a time leap machine, a device that could potentially change the course of history. Okabe, the self-proclaimed leader of this scientific endeavor, and Kurisu, the genius responsible for the technical aspects of the project, share a unique partnership. Their close acquaintances, Mayuri and Daru, who are also members of their lab, have left for the day. With a pen twirling in her fingers, Kurisu is lost in thought, contemplating the potential ramifications of their ambitious project. Feeling overwhelmed by the weight of their scientific exploration and personal issues, she decides to confide in Okabe about her strained relationship with her father.
