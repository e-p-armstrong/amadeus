In the cluttered and tech-filled Future Gadget Laboratory, Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru are engrossed in a grim investigation. These three friends, bound by their shared work on a time travel project, have stumbled upon the alarming secrets of a powerful organization, SERN. Okabe, usually boisterous, is shocked and silent, Kurisu is grim and focused, while Itaru hunches over his computer, pulling up disturbing reports. They have discovered the "Jellyman's Report," a series of documents revealing SERN's failed time travel experiments that resulted in human victims being turned into a gel-like substance, known as "Jellymen." As they delve deeper into the horrifying reports, their goal is clear: understand the dark secrets of SERN and the true cost of their time travel experiments. The atmosphere is tense and serious, the gravity of their findings casting a shadow over their usual camaraderie.
