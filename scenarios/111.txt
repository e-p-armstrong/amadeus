In a makeshift laboratory, friends and amateur scientists Okabe, Itaru, and Kurisu are huddled around a computer screen, poring over confidential documents they've illicitly accessed from a powerful organization's (SERN) database. Their bond is one of shared curiosity, intellectual pursuit, and a touch of rebellion. Okabe, the enthusiastic instigator of their group, grapples with a mix of excitement and apprehension, while Itaru, their resident hacker, is engrossed in the technical challenges before him. Kurisu, a brilliant thinker, is absorbed in contemplation, trying to reconcile the group's startling findings with existing scientific theory. They've stumbled upon information suggesting human experimentation with time travel, involving a theoretical concept called a Kerr black hole, hypothesized to allow for time displacement under extreme gravitational forces. As they delve deeper, each is driven by their own mix of fear, curiosity, and the irresistible pull of the unknown, in a tense atmosphere charged with the thrilling realization that the fantastical may be reality.
