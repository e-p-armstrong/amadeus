In their shared lab, a place brimming with scientific equipment and the scent of ongoing experiments, Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru are engrossed in a deep discussion about black holes and time travel. Their relationship is that of fellow researchers, with Kurisu being the more academically inclined genius explaining complex scientific principles to Okabe, a fellow scientist, and Itaru, a hacker friend who assists them. Okabe is grappling with the information, a sense of bewilderment evident in his demeanor, while Kurisu is animated, passionate about her subject. They are discussing the concept of Kerr black holes and the possibility of using them for time travel, an idea that seems to stem from their recent experiments. As Kurisu attempts to elucidate the concept, Okabe strives to comprehend it, and Itaru delves into researching 'lifter', a term from their discussion. The mood is intensely cerebral, punctuated by Itaru's comic struggles to keep up with the scientific jargon (Kurisu had been explaining Kerr black holes using a magical girl analogy earlier in the scene).
