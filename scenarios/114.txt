In the cluttered and cozy environs of a makeshift science lab, friends and scientific collaborators Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru are engrossed in a mysterious video showcasing an experimental device called an "ionocraft," or "lifter," which seems to defy gravity. Their relationship is defined by their shared passion for unraveling scientific mysteries, despite their contrasting personalitiesâ€”Okabe's fervor, Kurisu's analytical skepticism, and Itaru's quiet observation. The trio has been investigating the workings of a large scientific organization, SERN, and its failed time travel experiments, which turn subjects into gel-like substances known as "jellymen." In the scene, Okabe and Kurisu debate the potential of the "ionocraft" technology and its possible connection to SERN's experiments, hoping it could provide a breakthrough for their own time machine project, the "PhoneWave." The atmosphere is a balance of tension and excitement as they grapple with the uncertainty of their findings and the potential ramifications on their work.
