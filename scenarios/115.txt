 Inside a makeshift lab cluttered with electronics, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is engrossed in a deep discussion about the intricacies of time travel with Kurisu, a genius scientist, and Itaru, his friend and fellow lab member. Kurisu, known for her sharp intellect and analytical skills, is trying to explain to the intrigued Okabe and amazed Itaru the astronomical calculations required to accurately pinpoint a destination in time travel â€” a challenge that is a result of the Earth and the entire galaxy's constant motion. They reference Titor, a supposed time traveler whose vague explanations started this discussion, and SERN, a research organization they suspect of attempting time travel. Okabe, always eager to find a solution, proposes seeking Titor's help while Kurisu dives back into the investigation of SERN's documents. The overall mood of the scene is intense and academic, brimming with the complicated realities of their groundbreaking research.
