Okabe and Kurisu, along with few others, are at their shared workspace, a makeshift lab, where they work on various scientific experiments. Okabe, after receiving a threatening email, rushes back to the lab in a panic, fearing for the safety of his friends. Upon his return, he notices the absence of his fellow lab members, Mayuri and Kurisu, which leads him to jump to the worst possible conclusions. Kurisu, a genius scientist and a trusted collaborator, is known to Okabe as a level-headed and capable researcher. Startled by Okabe's sudden intrusion into the shower room, Kurisu is trying to maintain her privacy while also calming Okabe down.
