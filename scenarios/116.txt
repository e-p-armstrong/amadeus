Kurisu is in the small, cramped shower, with other members of the lab, including Mayuri, a fellow lab member whom she knows well. Okabe, another lab member and the self-proclaimed leader of the group, unexpectedly barges into the shower room, catching everyone by surprise.

Her immediate reaction is to express her frustration at Okabe for his unexpected and inappropriate entry.
