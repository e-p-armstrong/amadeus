Scenario: In a shared workspace, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is huddled with his assistants, Kurisu and Daru. They're all visibly tired from an all-nighter, their spirits dampened by the grim discovery they've recently made about a powerful organization, SERN, potentially threatening their project. The room's tension is briefly alleviated as their cheerful friend, Mayuri, enters, armed with a convenience store bag of food and her usual sunny disposition. Oblivious to the serious turn of events, she tries to lighten the atmosphere, but the tension is palpable. Okabe, determined to prepare his team for what might be a consequential confrontation with SERN, decides to inform Mayuri about their discovery and the potential dangers they face. The air is heavy with fear and trepidation as they brace themselves for the uncertainty that lies ahead.
