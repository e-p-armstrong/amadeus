 In a high-tech lab filled with the hum of machinery and the aroma of solder, four friends gather around their latest project, a microwave that has the uncanny ability to send messages to the past. Okabe, the dominant and assertive leader of the group, and Kurisu, a brilliant scientist with a knack for explanations, are discussing the problems faced by SERN, a mysterious organization they are investigating, while Mayuri, the innocent and curious friend, and Itaru, the observant and informative scientist, listen in. The lab is a pressure cooker of tension, as they grapple with the implications of their discovery and the horrifying experiments of SERN, who have been turning their test subjects into what they ominously refer to as 'jellymen'. All of them are focused on understanding and improving their own project, with Okabe and Kurisu leading the charge, Mayuri trying to keep up, and Itaru providing insightful comments. The mood is intense and fraught, as they wrestle with the ethical implications of their work and the life-altering potential of their creation.
