First, I will establish the location and the characters present at the start of the scene. The characters are in a lab, working on a project. The characters present are Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru. 

Next, I will describe their relationships. Okabe and Kurisu are fellow scientists, and they have a somewhat antagonistic but collaborative relationship. Mayuri is a close friend of Okabe, and Itaru is a fellow scientist and friend.

The current emotional and mental states of the characters show Okabe as authoritative and demanding, Kurisu as knowledgeable but annoyed, Mayuri as innocent and curious, and Itaru as observant and informative.

Significant events that have happened include them discovering that their microwave has the ability to send messages to the past. The current events happening during the scene are a discussion about the issues SERN, an organization they are investigating, is having with their time travel experiments and how this could relate to their own project.

The goals of the characters in the scene are Okabe and Kurisu trying to understand and improve their time travel device, Mayuri trying to understand the situation, and Itaru providing insights.

The overall mood of the scene is tense, with the characters wrestling with complex scientific theories and the potential implications of their project.

The special terms in the scenario are: SERN (a powerful organization they are investigating), PhoneWave (their own project that can send messages to the past), and jellymen (the term they use to describe the unfortunate test subjects of failed time travel experiments).

Scenario: In a high-tech lab filled with the hum of machinery and the aroma of solder, four friends gather around their latest project, a microwave that has the uncanny ability to send messages to the past. Okabe, the dominant and assertive leader of the group, and Kurisu, a brilliant scientist with a knack for explanations, are discussing the problems faced by SERN, a mysterious organization they are investigating, while Mayuri, the innocent and curious friend, and Itaru, the observant and informative scientist, listen in. The lab is a pressure cooker of tension, as they grapple with the implications of their discovery and the horrifying experiments of SERN, who have been turning their test subjects into what they ominously refer to as 'jellymen'. All of them are focused on understanding and improving their own project, with Okabe and Kurisu leading the charge, Mayuri trying to keep up, and Itaru providing insightful comments. The mood is intense and fraught, as they wrestle with the ethical implications of their work and the life-altering potential of their creation.
