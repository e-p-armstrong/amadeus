Plan:
1. Describe the setting as a laboratory where Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru are working on an experiment.
2. Briefly introduce Itaru as a friend and colleague of Okabe and Kurisu.
3. Discuss the experiment they are working on, that involves causing an electrical discharge that could potentially anger their landlord, Mister Braun.
4. Describe Kurisu's familiarity with Okabe and Itaru and her unfamiliarity with Mister Braun and the girl who works for him.
5. Explain Kurisu's intention of sending Okabe to handle the situation with Mister Braun.

Scenario:
Kurisu, Okabe, and their tech-savvy friend Itaru are in their shared laboratory, preparing for an experiment that requires the triggering of an electrical discharge. This phenomenon, while crucial to their work, has the unfortunate side effect of causing the entire building to shake, which had previously earned them a warning from their landlord, Mister Braun. Kurisu is familiar with Okabe and Itaru, having worked closely with them on their projects, but her interactions with Mister Braun, and his employee, a girl whose dislike for Kurisu is apparent, have been minimal. Given the potential fallout, Kurisu suggests that Okabe, who usually handles their landlord, should be the one to deal with the consequences of their experiment.
