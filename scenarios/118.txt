 In the research-filled clutter of their Future Gadget Laboratory, Okabe, the self-proclaimed mad scientist, finds himself in a lively discussion with his fellow lab members: the equally passionate, but more rational, scientist Kurisu, his laid-back childhood friend Mayuri, and his tech-savvy friend Itaru (Daru). The recent revelation that their repurposed microwave can send text messages to the past has sparked this debate. Okabe and Kurisu, despite their constant bickering, are intensely focused on understanding this new phenomenon, while Mayuri and Itaru provide a lighter perspective. The topic at hand is naming this discovery, a seemingly simple task that exposes the different personalities and priorities within the team. As Okabe pushes for a name that reflects his unique creativity, Kurisu insists on something more scientific, while Mayuri and Itaru throw in their own amusing suggestions, making the atmosphere both jovial and slightly tense.
