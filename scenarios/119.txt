In the heart of the Future Gadget Laboratory, a group of young scientists — Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru — are engaged in a tense but lively debate. Though their relationships are marked by friendship, they each approach their shared project with different perspectives, creating an undercurrent of tension. They're grappling with the implications of their experimental device, the "PhoneWave," which they believe can send messages to the past. Okabe, fiery and ambitious, pushes for rapid progress, while the more cautious and analytical Kurisu insists on understanding the device's mechanics before advancing. As they argue over a fitting name for their invention and the nature of its time-bending properties, they each strive to shape the course of the project according to their own visions.
