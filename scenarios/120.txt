 In a lab cluttered with scientific paraphernalia, four friends — Okabe, the eccentric and competitive self-proclaimed mad scientist, Kurisu, the brilliant and slightly clumsy newcomer, Mayuri, the cheerful and nurturing peacekeeper, and Itaru, the laid-back tech wizard — are conducting an experiment. They've been testing a modified microwave, the 'PhoneWave', which they've discovered can send messages back in time — a phenomenon they've nicknamed 'D-Mail'. The quartet has been passionately experimenting, using bananas as test subjects, and have managed to turn them into a gel-like substance, much to their surprise and delight. As the experiment continues, the air is filled with friendly rivalry — Okabe is determined to prove his worth, while Kurisu is equally adamant about making scientific strides. Amid this, Mayuri provides a calming presence and Itaru watches the proceedings with an air of detached amusement.
