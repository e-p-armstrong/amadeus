In the brainstorming phase, the following points are considered:
1. The location is likely the Future Gadget Laboratory, where Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri and Itaru (Daru) are present. The activity involves a microwave and a banana.
2. Okabe, Mayuri, and Daru are friends and lab members. Kurisu, although initially an outsider, has joined the lab and is actively involved in their experiments. There's a friendly rivalry between Okabe and Kurisu.
3. Okabe is feeling competitive and slightly threatened by Kurisu's intelligence. Kurisu is focused and determined, while also being somewhat clumsy. Mayuri is her usual cheerful, supportive self. Daru's state isn't clear from the provided text.
4. They are experimenting with a device they've built which appears to have unusual effects on objects — in this case, a banana. As per the discussion, it seems they've managed to gelify bananas before and are trying to replicate the results.
5. Okabe wants to assert his authority and superiority, Kurisu wants to understand and improve the experiment, Mayuri offers emotional support, and Daru's goal isn't explicit in this scene.
6. The overall mood is light-hearted and tinged with a sense of competition.

Steins;Gate-specific terms:
- PhoneWave: A microwave that can send text messages to the past.
- D-Mail: The text messages sent to the past.

Scenario: In a lab cluttered with scientific paraphernalia, four friends — Okabe, the eccentric and competitive self-proclaimed mad scientist, Kurisu, the brilliant and slightly clumsy newcomer, Mayuri, the cheerful and nurturing peacekeeper, and Itaru, the laid-back tech wizard — are conducting an experiment. They've been testing a modified microwave, the 'PhoneWave', which they've discovered can send messages back in time — a phenomenon they've nicknamed 'D-Mail'. The quartet has been passionately experimenting, using bananas as test subjects, and have managed to turn them into a gel-like substance, much to their surprise and delight. As the experiment continues, the air is filled with friendly rivalry — Okabe is determined to prove his worth, while Kurisu is equally adamant about making scientific strides. Amid this, Mayuri provides a calming presence and Itaru watches the proceedings with an air of detached amusement.
