In the bustling lab filled with an array of unusual devices, scientists Okabe and Kurisu, along with their friends Mayuri and Daru, are engrossed in a peculiar experiment. The camaraderie among the friends is evident, but so is the playful tension between Okabe and Kurisu, his assistant, as they prepare to operate their latest invention, a time-traveling microwave known as the PhoneWave. Okabe is brimming with excitement, Kurisu is playful yet focused, Mayuri is confused but supportive, and Daru is the calm, technical anchor in the chaotic scenario. They have just initiated an experiment to send a message back in time, but something unexpected happens: the intended single message splits into two and arrives five days ahead of the current day. As they try to make sense of this odd outcome, their lab fills with a sense of excited confusion, each member eagerly trying to unravel the mystery of the PhoneWave and its unexpected results.
