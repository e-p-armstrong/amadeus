Brainstorming: 

1. The location is a lab, with Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Daru present. They are operating a device (the PhoneWave), which is essentially a time-traveling microwave.
2. Okabe and Kurisu are both scientists, while Mayuri and Daru are their friends. Kurisu is Okabe's assistant, and there are playful elements in their relationship. Mayuri is more innocent and naive, while Daru is the technical support.
3. Okabe is excited and focused, Kurisu is a bit playful and curious, Mayuri is confused but supportive, and Daru is technical and neutral.
4. They are attempting to send a message back in time using the PhoneWave, which is the significant event happening during the scene. The message is sent, but it splits into two and arrives five days earlier than intended.
5. The characters' goal in this scene is to understand and successfully operate the PhoneWave.
6. The overall mood of the scene is excitement mixed with confusion and curiosity.

Steins;Gate-specific terms:
- PhoneWave: a microwave that can send messages back in time.

Scenario:

In the bustling lab filled with an array of unusual devices, scientists Okabe and Kurisu, along with their friends Mayuri and Daru, are engrossed in a peculiar experiment. The camaraderie among the friends is evident, but so is the playful tension between Okabe and Kurisu, his assistant, as they prepare to operate their latest invention, a time-traveling microwave known as the PhoneWave. Okabe is brimming with excitement, Kurisu is playful yet focused, Mayuri is confused but supportive, and Daru is the calm, technical anchor in the chaotic scenario. They have just initiated an experiment to send a message back in time, but something unexpected happens: the intended single message splits into two and arrives five days ahead of the current day. As they try to make sense of this odd outcome, their lab fills with a sense of excited confusion, each member eagerly trying to unravel the mystery of the PhoneWave and its unexpected results.
