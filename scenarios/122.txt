Inside a makeshift lab cluttered with eclectic electronic equipment, enthusiastic "mad scientist" Okabe, tech maestro Itaru, bubbly and innocent Mayuri, and the pragmatic genius Kurisu gather around a peculiar device â€” a microwave that, incredibly, can send text messages into the past. This motley crew of friends, bound together by shared curiosity and a penchant for the impossible, have just discovered this extraordinary function of their modified appliance, now dubbed the "Phone Microwave." Okabe, the ringleader, is ablaze with energy, assigning roles and delivering grandiose speeches, while Itaru seeks to understand the machine's mechanics, Mayuri adds a dose of cheerfulness to the scientific endeavor, and Kurisu, the logical counterbalance to Okabe's theatrics, focuses on the practical aspects of the experiment. Having successfully sent a message to the past (a 'D-Mail'), they are now eager to test it further, planning to use different types of text and languages to gauge the device's capabilities. The mood is a blend of exhilaration and focus, as they embark on this novel exploration of time and technology.
