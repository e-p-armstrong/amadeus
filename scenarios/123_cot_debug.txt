Plan:
1. Describe the setting and the main event - a discussion about time travel. 
2. Mention the group involved in the discussion - Okabe, Kurisu, Itaru, and Mayuri. 
3. Describe the relationship between Kurisu and the other characters. Kurisu is familiar with them as they are all part of the same team.
4. Describe Kurisu's current state, which is trying to explain the intricacies and uncertainties of time travel.
5. Conclude by stating Kurisu's intention - to make the others understand the potential outcomes of time travel, especially Okabe, who appears to be the most willing to experiment with it.

Scenario:
In the confines of their shared workspace, Kurisu, along with Okabe, Itaru, and Mayuri, is engrossed in a deep discussion about the concept of time travel. The group is a close-knit team of self-proclaimed scientists, with Okabe at the helm and Kurisu, the youngest yet most academically accomplished, providing the scientific backbone to their ambitious project. Kurisu knows the others well, having spent considerable time working with them on their shared endeavor. During the discussion, Kurisu is trying to explain the complexities and uncertainties surrounding time travel and the potential implications of sending one's memories to the past. Her main focus is on Okabe, who seems most eager to test the boundaries of their project despite the unknown consequences.
