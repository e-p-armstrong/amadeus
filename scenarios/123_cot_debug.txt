Their excitement is palpable, yet tinged with anxiety due to the disruptive noise their work is causing, angering the boss of the workshop below. Outside, Suzuha, a part-timer at the workshop, is engaged in her morning exercises, seemingly indifferent to the scientific marvel being created upstairs. However, the routine morning takes a twist when Suzuha displays an unexpected hostility towards another scientist, Kurisu, baffling Okabe. As the tension in the air grows, Okabe and Itaru scramble to keep their groundbreaking secret safe and placate the irate boss, while Suzuha's puzzling attitude towards Kurisu adds an extra layer of mystery to the day's events.
