In a run-down building that doubles as their laboratory, Okabe and his team of amateur scientists - Mayuri, Daru, and Kurisu - are conducting experiments with a makeshift time machine they've nicknamed the "Phone Microwave." Their experiments have been causing disturbances, leading to a tense confrontation between Okabe and Tennouji, the building's irate landlord. Despite Tennouji's threats of increasing the rent if the shaking doesn't stop, the team remains focused on their project, unconcerned and even eating lunch amid the chaos. Prior to the scene, they have been sending messages to the past, causing changes in the present, and inadvertently creating disturbances that have drawn Tennouji's ire. Okabe is trying to manage the situation and assure Tennouji that there won't be more disruptions while keeping his team focused on their work. The mood of the scene is tense yet oddly casual, a mix of scientific curiosity, youthful audacity, and the pressing threat of eviction.
