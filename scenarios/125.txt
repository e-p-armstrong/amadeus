 The scene unfolds in a shared lab space where Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru, a group of friends and researchers, are having a casual lunch together. Though they are friends, they are also colleagues, and a friendly banter is interwoven with serious discussions about their ongoing project, a device that can send messages to the past, dubbed "D-Mails." Okabe, the playful instigator, is trying to steer the conversation toward their project, while Kurisu, a focused and serious scientist, is eager to discuss their findings and figure out what they still need to learn. Meanwhile, Mayuri, ever cheerful, and Itaru, the laid-back observer, participate in the conversation as they see fit. The overall mood of the scene is light, yet focused, as they juggle their dual roles as friends and researchers.
