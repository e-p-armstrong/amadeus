Kurisu finds herself in a relaxed social gathering at Okabe's place, alongside a few other acquaintances of his. Among them are Mayuri, a close friend of Okabe's who Kurisu has grown friendly with but doesn't know deeply, and Itaru, another mutual acquaintance. Suzuha, a somewhat unfamiliar face to Kurisu, is also present, and there's a noticeable tension between her and Kurisu. As the gathering progresses, Kurisu gets engaged in a light-hearted conversation about cosplay with Mayuri and Itaru. However, she soon finds herself being confronted by Suzuha, and her immediate intention is to understand why Suzuha is showing hostility towards her.
