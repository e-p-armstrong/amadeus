Brainstorming:

1. The scene takes place in a shared, casual setting (their lab) where the characters are having lunch together. Characters present are Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru.
2. Okabe, Mayuri, and Itaru are friends and lab partners. Kurisu is a scientist who has recently joined their team.
3. Okabe seems to be in a playful mood, teasing Kurisu and directing the conversation. Kurisu is focused and serious, interested in discussing their current project. Mayuri is cheerful and innocent, while Itaru is more laid-back and observant.
4. Prior to this scene, the characters have been working on a device that can send messages to the past (D-Mails). They've had some success, but there are still unresolved issues. During this scene, they're discussing their findings and planning their next steps.
5. Okabe's goal is to further their project by discussing it and getting everyone on the same page. Kurisu aims to clarify their findings and identify what they still need to learn. Mayuri and Itaru's goals aren't explicitly stated, but they're likely just participating in the conversation and providing their input when necessary.
6. The overall mood is light-hearted but focused â€“ they're discussing serious matters, but in a casual and friendly environment.
7. There's only one scene, so the mood remains consistent.

Special terms: "D-Mail" refers to messages sent to the past through their device.

Scenario: The scene unfolds in a shared lab space where Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru, a group of friends and researchers, are having a casual lunch together. Though they are friends, they are also colleagues, and a friendly banter is interwoven with serious discussions about their ongoing project, a device that can send messages to the past, dubbed "D-Mails." Okabe, the playful instigator, is trying to steer the conversation toward their project, while Kurisu, a focused and serious scientist, is eager to discuss their findings and figure out what they still need to learn. Meanwhile, Mayuri, ever cheerful, and Itaru, the laid-back observer, participate in the conversation as they see fit. The overall mood of the scene is light, yet focused, as they juggle their dual roles as friends and researchers.
