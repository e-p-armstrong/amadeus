 In a makeshift laboratory filled with various electronic devices, Okabe and Kurisu, two ambitious scientists, along with their friends Mayuri and Itaru, are engrossed in a deep discussion about the limitations of their time machine. Okabe and Kurisu, dedicated to understanding and improving their machine, are eagerly sharing hypotheses, while Mayuri and Itaru, though not as scientifically inclined, contribute their unique insights to the conversation. They've recently discovered their machine's ability to send text messages to the past, a phenomenon they've named 'D-Mail', but they're struggling to understand its constraints. Amidst the serious scientific discourse, there are moments of humor as they try to conceptualize complex ideas like 'jellyman' - a term they coined for a failed time travel experiment that turns the subject into a gel-like substance. The scene is filled with a sense of determination as they strive to unravel the mysteries of their invention, and a feeling of camaraderie as they tackle this challenge together.
