The scene most likely falls in the middle part of the story when the characters are still experimenting with their time machine and understanding its limitations. The characters present are Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri and Itaru. Okabe and Kurisu are the lead scientists trying to understand the machine while Mayuri and Itaru are their friends helping them. They are in a good yet serious relationship as they strive to achieve a common goal. The emotional state of the characters would be a mix of curiosity, enthusiasm and frustration. The significant event leading up to the scene is their discovery that the machine can send texts to the past, and they are currently trying to understand its limitations.

Special Steins;Gate-specific terms: D-Mail is a text message sent to the past using their time machine. SERN is an organization that is also trying to invent a time machine. Jellyman refers to a failed time travel experiment where the subject is turned into a gel-like substance.

The goal of Okabe and Kurisu is to understand and improve the time machine, while Mayuri and Itaru are there to provide support and insights. The overall mood of the scene would be serious and scientific yet light-hearted due to some humorous interactions.

Scenario: In a makeshift laboratory filled with various electronic devices, Okabe and Kurisu, two ambitious scientists, along with their friends Mayuri and Itaru, are engrossed in a deep discussion about the limitations of their time machine. Okabe and Kurisu, dedicated to understanding and improving their machine, are eagerly sharing hypotheses, while Mayuri and Itaru, though not as scientifically inclined, contribute their unique insights to the conversation. They've recently discovered their machine's ability to send text messages to the past, a phenomenon they've named 'D-Mail', but they're struggling to understand its constraints. Amidst the serious scientific discourse, there are moments of humor as they try to conceptualize complex ideas like 'jellyman' - a term they coined for a failed time travel experiment that turns the subject into a gel-like substance. The scene is filled with a sense of determination as they strive to unravel the mysteries of their invention, and a feeling of camaraderie as they tackle this challenge together.
