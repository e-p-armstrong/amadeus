Plan:
1. Start by explaining the setting and the tension between Okabe and Suzuha, without revealing any future plot points.
2. Briefly introduce Suzuha as a character Kurisu is familiar with but has complicated relations.
3. Describe Kurisu's current state, being caught off guard by the conversation between Okabe and Suzuha.
4. State Kurisu's intention, which is to understand what Okabe and Suzuha are talking about.

Scenario:
Caught in the middle of an intense dispute between Okabe, an eccentric young man she's close to, and Suzuha, a fiery individual with a complex relationship to the group, Kurisu finds herself in a tense situation. The setting is a familiar one, yet the conversation is not. Kurisu knows Suzuha as a well-meaning yet aggressive member of their group, but she's taken aback by the sudden accusation Suzuha throws at her. Despite her surprise, Kurisu tries to understand the situation, and specifically, Okabe's and Suzuha's conversation she walked into.
