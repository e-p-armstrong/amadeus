Based on the dialogue, this scene likely occurs after the discovery of the capability of the "Phone Microwave" to send messages to the past, but before the realization that these messages' consequences can be dire. The key players are Kurisu, Okabe, Itaru, and Mayuri, who are all part of the same friend group and research team. They are in a discussion about the mechanics behind their makeshift time machine. The mood of the scene is a mix of curiosity, confusion, and slight tension.

The special terms are: 
1. SERN: a scientific research organization that has been conducting time travel experiments.
2. PhoneWave: the accidental time machine created by the group, which can send messages (D-mails) back in time.
3. The ring singularity, event horizon, and lifter: components of a black hole; in this context, they are being used to explain the mechanics of time travel.
4. Jellymen: the failed human time travel experiments by SERN, resulting in gelified humans.

Now, let's write the scenario.

Scenario: In a cluttered lab filled with makeshift scientific equipment, Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru are engrossed in a heated discussion about the mechanics of their accidental invention, the PhoneWave, which they've discovered can send messages to the past. They all share a deep bond from their joint venture, although their relationships are colored by their distinct personalities: Okabe with his eccentricity, Kurisu's objective brilliance, Mayuri's naive charm, and Itaru's dry wit. The mood is tense, yet buzzing with the thrill of scientific discovery, as each character grapples with their understanding of the phenomenon. They are trying to understand the intricacies of what their device does, referencing complex terms such as 'ring singularity', 'event horizon', and 'lifter', all while trying to avoid the gruesome fate of SERN's failed 'jellymen' experiments. The goal for each character is to contribute their understanding and further the group's knowledge, whether through logical hypothesis, simple metaphors, or light-hearted banter. The overall mood of the scene is a balanced mix of intellectual curiosity and the underlying anxiety of venturing into the unknown.
