 In a cluttered laboratory, the eccentric Okabe Rintaro, his childhood friend Mayuri Shiina, the computer whiz Itaru Hashida, and the brilliant scientist Kurisu Makise have gathered. United by their shared involvement in inventing, the group's dynamics are a mix of Okabe's wild enthusiasm, Kurisu's scientific rigor, Itaru's tech expertise, and Mayuri's domestic care. Amidst the littered gadgets, the group has recently stumbled upon an unexpected potential in one of their inventions, the "PhoneWave", which appears to behave like a time machine. Okabe, buzzing with excitement, is determined to proclaim their accidental discovery as a groundbreaking achievement, while Kurisu and Itaru caution the need for further investigation to validate this "time travel", and Mayuri tries to maintain some semblance of order. The air is charged with a mixture of exhilaration, skepticism, and a hint of exhaustion as they navigate through the implications of their discovery.
