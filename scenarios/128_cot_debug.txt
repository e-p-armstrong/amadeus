Scenario:
In the heart of Akihabara, a tense encounter unfolds between Okabe, Kurisu, and a mysterious woman named Moeka. Moeka is a stranger to them, having just emerged with a dangerous proposition and a frightening show of force. Kurisu, an accomplished scientist, is well-acquainted with Okabe, but she has no knowledge of or past with Moeka. Overcome with confusion and fear due to the sudden threat, she remains silent, anxiously observing the unfolding situation. Finally, unable to bear the uncertainty, Kurisu breaks her silence, trying to understand why they are being specifically targeted by Moeka.
