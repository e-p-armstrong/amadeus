In the cluttered confines of a makeshift lab, Okabe, the eccentric self-proclaimed scientist, is having a tense encounter with Moeka, a socially awkward woman fixated on acquiring the IBN 5100 â€” a piece of technology that Okabe is determined to protect. There's an undercurrent of mistrust between them, heightened by Okabe's internal musings about potential scenarios that could lead to the loss of the device. Okabe is also wrestling with a sense of impending doom, the weight of the world seemingly on his shoulders as he refers to himself as "Hououin Kyouma", his alter ego. The tension is broken by the arrival of Itaru, commonly known as Daru, who lightens the mood with his comedic comments and obliviousness to the seriousness of Okabe's thoughts. Okabe is intent on maintaining control over the IBN 5100, while Moeka is determined to acquire it, setting the stage for a potential conflict. The overall mood of the scene oscillates between tension and levity, reflecting the dynamics of the characters present.
