In the lab, Okabe and his fellow scientist Itaru, also known as Daru, are discussing potential upgrades to their prototype time machine - a device they've been using to send emails, or "D-mails", to the past. The usually jovial Daru is serious about the project, while the more focused Okabe is trying to navigate the awkward social dynamic with Moeka, a new but distant acquaintance who seems more interested in her phone than their conversation. They've been experimenting with their machine, now trying to make it more user-friendly, but the atmosphere is tense as Moeka's unusual behavior continues to bewilder them. As Okabe and Daru plan to simplify the process of sending D-mails, Moeka's sudden focus on Okabe disrupts the flow of their work. The scene is a blend of focused scientific endeavor and awkward social interaction, as the trio navigates the complexities of their project and their evolving relationships.
