Plan:
1. Start by describing the setting - a tense situation in the development room.
2. Briefly introduce the other characters present in the scene, explaining Kurisu's relation to them.
3. Describe the current state of affairs - Mayuri's death and the urgency to use the Time Leap Machine.
4. Conclude by stating Kurisu's intention - to be the one to risk using the Time Leap Machine to prevent Mayuri's death.

Scenario:
Kurisu finds herself in a high-stress situation in a technology development room, tense with urgency, alongside Okabe and their companions, Suzuha and Moeka, both of whom she knows well from their shared experiences. The group faces a dire predicament: their friend Mayuri has just been fatally shot and one of their adversaries is stirring, threatening to end their desperate plan prematurely. Amidst this chaos, an idea sparks - the controversial Time Leap Machine, a device they've been working on that could change the past, but at the risk of frying the user's brain. Despite the high stakes and imminent danger, Kurisu, driven by her scientific curiosity and the desire to save Mayuri, bravely volunteers to take the risk and use the machine herself.
