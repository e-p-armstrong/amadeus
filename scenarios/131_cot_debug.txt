Brainstorming:
This conversation takes place during the time when the group is experimenting with the PhoneWave, a machine they've discovered can send messages to the past. Okabe is talking to Moeka, who knows about the PhoneWave and is suspected of intending to leak its information. Okabe's friend, Daru, interrupts the conversation, inadvertently revealing to Moeka that the PhoneWave is a time machine. The characters present are Okabe, Moeka, Daru, and briefly Mayuri. The relationship between Okabe and Moeka is tense, as he suspects her of being a threat to their secret, while Daru seems oblivious to the gravity of the situation. Okabe is anxious and desperate, Moeka is curious but unreadable, Daru is casual, and Mayuri is cheerful yet clueless. The overall mood of the scene is tense and chaotic.

Scenario:
In the midst of their shared lab, Okabe confronts Moeka, a reticent woman who's discovered their secret experiment: a device named "PhoneWave" that can send messages into the past. Okabe's always been paranoid about outside threats, and he views Moeka as one such potential danger. Meanwhile, his friend Daru is unaware of the brewing storm and continues to work on the machine. Okabe is trying to intimidate Moeka into keeping their secret, while Moeka remains enigmatic, her intentions unclear. Suddenly, the tension spikes as Daru unknowingly reveals the true nature of the PhoneWave to Moeka: it's a time machine. The scene is fraught with anxiety and a sense of impending doom, as Okabe struggles to contain the situation he feels is spiraling out of control.
