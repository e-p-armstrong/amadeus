In the cluttered laboratory of a group of young, ambitious scientists, Okabe, Itaru, Kurisu, and Mayuri are planning to resume their clandestine experiments that trigger noticeable tremors in the building. Their dynamic is a mix of camaraderie and playful teasing, with Okabe often being the butt of jokes for his eccentricities. As they prep their apparatus, they are concerned about their strict landlord, Mister Braun, who has previously chided them for the shaking. Outside the building, Suzuha, a part-time worker at a nearby shop, is polishing her bike in the company of Tennouji Nae, the landlord's daughter. Okabe is under pressure to negotiate with Mister Braun so they can continue their experiments, while also trying to maintain the group's morale. The atmosphere is one of suspense and anticipation, with a sprinkling of humor.
