Because of a shared interest in scientific exploration, Kurisu finds herself in a casual gathering at a lab, along with Okabe, Daru, Mayuri, and Suzuha. Okabe, Mayuri, and Daru are close friends, while Suzuha is a recent acquaintance, like Kurisu. Kurisu knows Mayuri well and they are on friendly terms, while her relationship with Suzuha is tense, due to an unexplained hostility from Suzuha. In the midst of their friendly banter about cosplay and school uniforms, Kurisu is trying to understand and address the inexplicable tension between her and Suzuha.
