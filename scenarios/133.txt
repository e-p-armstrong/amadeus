" In a cluttered room filled with gadgets and gizmos, a group of friends gather around a peculiar device, a makeshift time machine capable of sending messages into the past. Okabe, the eccentric self-proclaimed mad scientist, spearheads the operation, his friends Itaru, Mayuri, Kurisu, and Moeka at his side, each with their respective roles and contributions. Okabe, with his dramatic flair, is eager to proceed with the experiment now that they have the lab to themselves. Kurisu, the scientific genius of the group, attempts to keep things grounded, her frustration evident as she deals with the others' antics. Amidst this, Moeka, the introverted photographer, silently observes, her interest piqued by the potential of the time machine. As the group prepares to take a monumental step into the unknown, the atmosphere is a mix of tense anticipation and playful bickering, a testament to their shared journey thus far.
