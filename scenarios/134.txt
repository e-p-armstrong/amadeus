 
In a bustling lab filled with electronic equipment and a handful of passionate minds, Okabe, an eccentric scientist, calls for a meeting with his team: Kurisu, a sharp-witted assistant, Mayuri, a cheerful friend, Itaru, a laid-back hacker, and Moeka, an intense newcomer. Outside, Suzuha, a bystander, is trying to decipher the mysterious activities inside from the strange lights and vibrations. While the team shares a collective fascination with the boundary-pushing work they're doing, tension arises when Okabe announces his intention to experiment with their latest discovery: a method they've devised to send messages, which they call D-Mails, back in time, limited to only 36 characters. Kurisu, ever the voice of reason, immediately voices her concern about the potential danger of altering the past. As Okabe pushes forward with his audacious plan, each member grapples with the implications of their work, setting the stage for a debate charged with excitement, skepticism, and curiosity.
