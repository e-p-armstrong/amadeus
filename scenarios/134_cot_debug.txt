Brainstorming:
1. Location and characters present: The scene is set in a scientific lab filled with a diverse group of characters - Okabe, the eccentric scientist, Kurisu, his sharp-tongued assistant, Mayuri, the innocent and friendly girl, Itaru, the laid back hacker, and Moeka, a quiet but intense woman. Suzuha, another character, is outside the lab.
2. Relationships: Okabe and Kurisu share a complex relationship filled with banter and debate, while Mayuri is Okabe's long-time friend. Itaru is Okabe's collaborator, and Moeka is a recent addition to the group. Suzuha is an outsider looking in.
3. Emotional states: Okabe is excited and a bit reckless, Kurisu is skeptical and concerned, Mayuri is curious and innocent, Itaru is carefree and dismissive, Moeka is silent and observant, Suzuha is perplexed.
4. Significant events: The group has discovered a way to send messages (D-Mails) to the past, and they're about to explore its potential uses. They've found that the number of characters they can send is limited.
5. Goals: Okabe wants to advance his time-altering experiments. Kurisu wants to ensure safety and reason. Mayuri and Itaru seem more interested in being part of the fun, while Moeka is quietly observing. Suzuha is trying to understand what's happening in the lab.
6. Overall mood: The mood is a mix of excitement, skepticism, curiosity, and concern.
7. Special terms: D-Mail - short for DeLorean mail, a way to send messages to the past.

Scenario: 
In a bustling lab filled with electronic equipment and a handful of passionate minds, Okabe, an eccentric scientist, calls for a meeting with his team: Kurisu, a sharp-witted assistant, Mayuri, a cheerful friend, Itaru, a laid-back hacker, and Moeka, an intense newcomer. Outside, Suzuha, a bystander, is trying to decipher the mysterious activities inside from the strange lights and vibrations. While the team shares a collective fascination with the boundary-pushing work they're doing, tension arises when Okabe announces his intention to experiment with their latest discovery: a method they've devised to send messages, which they call D-Mails, back in time, limited to only 36 characters. Kurisu, ever the voice of reason, immediately voices her concern about the potential danger of altering the past. As Okabe pushes forward with his audacious plan, each member grapples with the implications of their work, setting the stage for a debate charged with excitement, skepticism, and curiosity.
