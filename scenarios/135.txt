 This interaction takes place in the lab, where Okabe, Kurisu, Daru, and Mayuri are gathered around the PhoneWave, a microwave oven they've discovered has an unusual ability to send messages to the past. Okabe and Kurisu, both scientists, are locked in a heated debate about the ethical implications and potential ramifications of changing the past, while Daru, Okabe's best friend and fellow researcher, interjects with his own understanding of the subject. Mayuri, Okabe's good-natured and somewhat oblivious childhood friend, is also present, though she struggles to keep up with the complex scientific discussion. The argument intensifies as Kurisu raises concerns about the Butterfly Effect, a theory suggesting that small changes in the past could significantly alter the future, while Okabe, driven by curiosity and excitement, argues for experimentation. As they navigate this moral and scientific quandary, each character reveals their own perspective: Okabe, eager to push the boundaries of their discovery; Kurisu, concerned about potential consequences; Daru, attempting to mediate and understand; and Mayuri, lost but willing to participate. The overall mood is a tense blend of excitement and fear as they grapple with the potential of their newfound power.
