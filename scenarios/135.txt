In the aftermath of a tragic accident, Okabe finds himself in immediate danger, with unknown assailants closing in on him. Despite his injuries, he manages to escape and reaches the safety of their usual meeting spot - the lab - which is surprisingly empty of his colleagues, Kurisu, and Daru. In a desperate bid to change the past and save a dear friend, Okabe, injured and alone, decides to utilize a device they've developed that potentially allows him to leap back in time. Kurisu, who has been working closely with Okabe on this device, enters the lab just as Okabe activates the machine, catching her off guard and leaving her in a state of confusion about Okabe's abrupt and frantic actions.
