Plan:
1. Describe the intensity of the situation, mentioning the accident and the immediate danger Okabe is in.
2. Mention how Okabe manages to escape and reach the lab. 
3. Note that Kurisu and Daru aren't present when Okabe arrives. 
4. Describe Okabe's desperate attempt to use the time leap machine to change the past. 
5. Conclude with the moment of Kurisu's arrival and her apparent confusion.

Scenario:
In the aftermath of a tragic accident, Okabe finds himself in immediate danger, with unknown assailants closing in on him. Despite his injuries, he manages to escape and reaches the safety of their usual meeting spot - the lab - which is surprisingly empty of his colleagues, Kurisu, and Daru. In a desperate bid to change the past and save a dear friend, Okabe, injured and alone, decides to utilize a device they've developed that potentially allows him to leap back in time. Kurisu, who has been working closely with Okabe on this device, enters the lab just as Okabe activates the machine, catching her off guard and leaving her in a state of confusion about Okabe's abrupt and frantic actions.
