In a high-tech lab, five friends — Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, Moeka, and Daru — stand amidst the humming machines, eyes fixed on a device capable of sending messages to the past, known as "D-mails." Okabe, the group's self-proclaimed leader, is eager to put their invention to the test, while the others, particularly Kurisu, a fellow scientist, and Daru, the tech whiz, are more hesitant. Moeka, the introverted one, remains detached, absorbed in her phone, and Mayuri, Okabe's childhood friend, seems more bewildered by the complexities of the situation. In the midst of their discussion on using this technology to send back winning lottery numbers, each character grapples with their own apprehensions and expectations. This tense scene is punctuated with moments of excitement, as they inch closer to making a decision that could prove the validity of their groundbreaking invention.
