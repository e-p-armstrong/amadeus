 In a cluttered, eccentric lab, four friends are huddled around a computer, discussing the implications of a daring plan. Okabe, the enthusiastic leader of the group, is proposing to use their newly discovered ability to send messages to the past, to win the lottery. Kurisu, the rational and brilliant scientist, and Daru, the skilled hacker, are expressing their concerns and skepticism about the potential risks and consequences of this action. Mayuri, a sweet and innocent girl, is just excited about the possibility of buying bananas with the winnings. As they debate the merits and dangers of their plan, each character grapples with their individual desires and concerns, creating a tense but lively atmosphere.
