Plan:
1. Describe the setting and event leading to the scene - the aftermath of a decision not to conduct an experiment with a machine, where Okabe has a breakdown and leaves.
2. Introduce the relationship between Kurisu and Okabe - she is a close friend and collaborator in Okabe's scientific endeavors.
3. Describe Okabe's state, visibly distressed and Kurisu's concern for him.
4. End by stating Kurisu's intention - to understand what's wrong with Okabe and help him.

Scenario:
In a research lab, the aftermath of a heated decision not to proceed with a potentially dangerous experiment takes place. Okabe, a close friend and collaborator of Kurisu's, reacts negatively to the decision, showing signs of distress before leaving abruptly. Kurisu, concerned about Okabe's well-being and puzzled by his strange behavior, decides to follow him. Finding Okabe in a state of despair on a pedestrian overpass in the city, Kurisu attempts to engage him, trying to understand what's troubling him and how she can help.
