 In a makeshift laboratory, self-proclaimed mad scientist Okabe, genius scientist Kurisu, expert hacker Itaru, friendly Mayuri, and email-savvy Moeka are preparing for an experiment. This group, bound by their shared curiosity and friendship, is about to conduct a daring trial: to send a message to the past using their homemade device, the PhoneWave. The atmosphere is tense, as Okabe tasks the introverted Moeka with crafting the critical email that will convince a past version of himself to alter a key decision. As they input data into their homemade device, each character is focused on their role â€” Moeka composes the email, Kurisu and Itaru manage the technical details, Mayuri provides moral support, and Okabe, the leader, oversees the process. The overall mood is one of heightened anticipation as they edge closer to potentially changing the past.
