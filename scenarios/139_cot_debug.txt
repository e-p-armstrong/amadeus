Plan:
1. Start by mentioning the state of Okabe - he's distressed because of his actions that led to a tragic outcome.
2. Introduce the other characters as Okabe's friends and fellow lab members, and Kurisu's relation to them.
3. Describe Kurisu's current state - she's concerned about Okabe and trying to understand his situation.
4. State the location and the situation they are in - Okabe and Kurisu are in the lab, discussing the consequences of Okabe's actions.
5. End by stating Kurisu's intention - to give Okabe advice and help him with his problem.

Scenario:
Okabe, distressed by the consequences of his past actions, finds himself in a lab alongside his friends Daru, Moeka, and Mayuri, who are also lab members. Kurisu, a close associate and friend of Okabe, also knows these lab members well. She is concerned about Okabe's desperate state and is trying to understand the full depth of his dilemmas. In the midst of their intense discussion about the risks of time travel and its impact on their lives, Kurisu is attempting to rationalize Okabe's fears and offer him advice on how to proceed.
