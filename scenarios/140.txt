In a humble lab cluttered with technology, Okabe, an eccentric mad scientist, stands clutching his phone after sending a message into the past through their newly discovered time machine, a modified microwave. His childhood friend Mayuri shows concern for his wellbeing while the tech expert of the group, Daru, is more interested in his computer than his friend's unease. Kurisu, a genius scientist who's recently joined them, is engrossed in a technical book, seemingly undisturbed by the strange happenings around her. Moeka, a timid woman with a keen interest in their experiments, watches from the periphery of the room. Okabe, disoriented with a sense of vertigo, is anxious to see if his experiment of sending a message to his past self about a lottery win has worked. This scene is tense and chaotic, filled with a sense of unease as Okabe grapples with the disorienting effects of meddling with time.
