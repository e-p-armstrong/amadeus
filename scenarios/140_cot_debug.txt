Brainstorming:
This scene appears to take place early in the series after Okabe and the team have discovered the ability to send messages into the past, but are still experimenting with it. The characters present are Okabe, Mayuri, Daru, Kurisu, and Moeka. Okabe is the one who has just sent a message to the past and is experiencing the effects of it, while Mayuri, his childhood friend, is concerned about his wellbeing. Daru, the tech whiz of the group, is casually using the computer, unconcerned by Okabe's actions. Kurisu, a genius scientist who recently joined the lab, is reading a book on the sofa. Moeka, a shy woman with a strong interest in the labâ€™s activities, is standing at the edge of the room. The PhoneWave is a microwave they've discovered can send messages to the past. The term LOTO SIX refers to a lottery.

Scenario:
In a humble lab cluttered with technology, Okabe, an eccentric mad scientist, stands clutching his phone after sending a message into the past through their newly discovered time machine, a modified microwave. His childhood friend Mayuri shows concern for his wellbeing while the tech expert of the group, Daru, is more interested in his computer than his friend's unease. Kurisu, a genius scientist who's recently joined them, is engrossed in a technical book, seemingly undisturbed by the strange happenings around her. Moeka, a timid woman with a keen interest in their experiments, watches from the periphery of the room. Okabe, disoriented with a sense of vertigo, is anxious to see if his experiment of sending a message to his past self about a lottery win has worked. This scene is tense and chaotic, filled with a sense of unease as Okabe grapples with the disorienting effects of meddling with time.
