 
In a small, bustling lab, Kurisu is working alongside Okabe, her unpredictable and often eccentric lab partner, as well as Mayuri and Daru, her close friends and fellow lab members. Kurisu knows all of them well; they are her allies in their shared endeavor to push the boundaries of science. She is preparing to test a time leap machine, a groundbreaking invention that could alter the course of their lives. At this moment, Kurisu is trying to ensure the safety and success of this endeavor by giving Okabe precise instructions on his actions and behavior after he leaps back in time.
