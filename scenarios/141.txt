In their shared laboratory, Okabe stands agitated among his friends - the calm genius Kurisu, the laid-back Daru, the cheerful Mayuri, and the quiet Moeka. Closest to Kurisu due to their shared scientific pursuits, and having a long-standing friendship with the others, Okabe is normally at ease in these surroundings. However, he is currently in a state of confusion and frustration, having just sent a message to his past self with winning lottery numbers - a message that his friends seem to have no memory of. This suggests a change in the timeline, a concept they've been experimenting with via these 'D-mails' under their ongoing 'Operation Urd'. As Okabe struggles to make sense of the situation, his friends launch into a casual discussion about what message they should send to the past, oblivious to Okabe's distress. The overall mood is a chaotic blend of Okabe's tension and the others' relaxed chatter, with an undercurrent of mystery as they navigate the uncharted waters of time manipulation.
