The scene likely falls after Okabe and his friends have discovered the ability to send messages to the past but before the serious consequences of their actions begin to occur. Okabe has just sent a message to his past self with winning lottery numbers, but his friends don't seem to remember this event, suggesting a timeline shift.

Steins;Gate-specific terms:
- D-mails are messages sent to the past
- Operation Urd is their ongoing experiment with D-mails

Brainstorm:
1. The scene takes place in their shared lab, where Okabe, Kurisu, Daru, Mayuri, and Moeka are present.
2. Okabe is friends with everyone present. He and Kurisu share a closer bond due to their shared interest in science and time travel, and Mayuri is his oldest friend.
3. Okabe is confused and frustrated, Kurisu and Daru are relaxed but curious, Mayuri is cheerful and oblivious, and Moeka is quiet and reserved.
4. Okabe has just sent a D-mail with winning lottery numbers, yet his friends don't seem to remember, suggesting a timeline shift.
5. Okabe is trying to make sense of what's happening, while the others are discussing what message they should send to the past.
6. The mood is tense and chaotic, as Okabe's confusion clashes with the others' casual conversation.
7. The scene remains in the same location, but the emotion changes from confusion and tension to light-heartedness when Luka enters.

Scenario:
In their shared laboratory, Okabe stands agitated among his friends - the calm genius Kurisu, the laid-back Daru, the cheerful Mayuri, and the quiet Moeka. Closest to Kurisu due to their shared scientific pursuits, and having a long-standing friendship with the others, Okabe is normally at ease in these surroundings. However, he is currently in a state of confusion and frustration, having just sent a message to his past self with winning lottery numbers - a message that his friends seem to have no memory of. This suggests a change in the timeline, a concept they've been experimenting with via these 'D-mails' under their ongoing 'Operation Urd'. As Okabe struggles to make sense of the situation, his friends launch into a casual discussion about what message they should send to the past, oblivious to Okabe's distress. The overall mood is a chaotic blend of Okabe's tension and the others' relaxed chatter, with an undercurrent of mystery as they navigate the uncharted waters of time manipulation.
