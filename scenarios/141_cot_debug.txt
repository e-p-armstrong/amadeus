Plan:
1. Start by describing the setting, which is a lab where Kurisu and others are working on a time travel project.
2. Introduce the other characters present in this scene: Okabe, Mayuri, and Daru, and explain their relationship with Kurisu.
3. Describe Kurisu's current situation, which is that she is preparing to test a time leap machine.
4. Conclude by stating Kurisu's intention in this scene, which is to instruct Okabe on what he should do after the time leap.

Scenario: 
In a small, bustling lab, Kurisu is working alongside Okabe, her unpredictable and often eccentric lab partner, as well as Mayuri and Daru, her close friends and fellow lab members. Kurisu knows all of them well; they are her allies in their shared endeavor to push the boundaries of science. She is preparing to test a time leap machine, a groundbreaking invention that could alter the course of their lives. At this moment, Kurisu is trying to ensure the safety and success of this endeavor by giving Okabe precise instructions on his actions and behavior after he leaps back in time.
