Kurisu and Okabe, close friends and fellow experimenters, are engaged in a deep discussion about a time travel experiment they've been working on. In the midst of this discussion, Okabe makes a startling claim - he says he has traveled from five hours in the future, a claim Kurisu is skeptical of. Despite her skepticism, she is deeply invested in their experiments and trusts Okabe. Kurisu's primary goal is to understand Okabe's experience and use it to help navigate the complex issues they are facing with their time travel experiments.
