In a lab bustling with scientific equipment, the mad scientist Okabe converses with his friends Luka, Mayuri, Kurisu, and Itaru. As they engage in their usual experiments, Luka, a timid friend, reveals a lottery ticket, causing a ripple of surprise and confusion. Okabe, known for his eccentric behavior, becomes fixated on the ticket, recognizing it from a past experiment where they used a device — a hybrid microwave-cellphone — to send messages back in time, altering past events. As Okabe tries to piece together the mystery of the lottery ticket, his friends navigate their own reactions — Luka, apologetic for an unknown mistake; Mayuri, trying to keep the peace; Kurisu and Itaru, attempting to make sense of Okabe's strange behavior. Amid the confusion and chaos, they all grapple with the implications of the past-altering power they've stumbled upon.
