In a tense and desperate situation, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is grappling with his repeated failures to save his friend Mayuri from a series of tragic deaths. Alongside him is Kurisu, a young genius who has been a key member in Okabe's lab and a close collaborator in their time-travel experiments. Although Kurisu has not experienced these horrific events firsthand due to Okabe's unique ability to retain memories across time leaps, she is well aware of Okabe's struggles and the heavy emotional toll they have taken on him. In an effort to help Okabe understand the situation better, Kurisu attempts to explain the intricate nature of causality and the limitations of their time-travel machine.
