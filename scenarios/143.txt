At a local electronics shop, Okabe, a self-styled mad scientist, steps outside to clear his mind after noticing that a message he previously sent to the past - a "D-Mail" as they call it - has mysteriously disappeared from his send history. Suzuha, a part-time worker at the shop with a playful personality and a mysterious past, is polishing her bicycle nearby, accompanied by Nae, the young and innocent daughter of the shop's owner. Despite the camaraderie among them, Okabe is grappling with his anxious thoughts, while Suzuha, aware of his distress, decides to lighten the mood. In a teasing attempt to help Okabe, she performs a faux examination on him to check if he has been brainwashed by the "Organization," a nebulous entity often referred to in Okabe's delusions. As Okabe tries to figure out the mystery of his missing D-Mail, Suzuha aims to ease his worry through humor and shared camaraderie, while Nae observes their interaction with a mix of curiosity and caution. The atmosphere of the scene is light-hearted and playful, yet underscored by a sense of concern and intrigue.
