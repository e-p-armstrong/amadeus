Plan:
1. Describe the immediate situation - Okabe is in a state of distress over repeated failures to save Mayuri from death.
2. Mention the characters involved in this conversation - Okabe and Kurisu. Kurisu is trying to help Okabe understand the situation better.
3. Describe Kurisu's knowledge of the situation and her relationship with Okabe and the other characters mentioned - She is a member of Okabe's lab and has been working closely with him, but she is unaware of the events Okabe has experienced because of his ability to retain memories across time leaps.
4. Establish Kurisu's intentions in this conversation - She's trying to explain the limitations of their time machine and the complexities of causality to Okabe.

Scenario:
In a tense and desperate situation, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is grappling with his repeated failures to save his friend Mayuri from a series of tragic deaths. Alongside him is Kurisu, a young genius who has been a key member in Okabe's lab and a close collaborator in their time-travel experiments. Although Kurisu has not experienced these horrific events firsthand due to Okabe's unique ability to retain memories across time leaps, she is well aware of Okabe's struggles and the heavy emotional toll they have taken on him. In an effort to help Okabe understand the situation better, Kurisu attempts to explain the intricate nature of causality and the limitations of their time-travel machine.
