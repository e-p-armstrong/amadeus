Kurisu is in a lab alongside Okabe, a fellow researcher, and Mayuri, a friend to both of them. As Okabe grows increasingly frantic over an imminent threat to Mayuri, Kurisu, who knows Mayuri well and has positive feelings towards her, struggles to comprehend the situation. Outside the lab, Suzuha, a slightly enigmatic acquaintance who has shown hostility toward Kurisu in the past, attracts Okabe's attention. Feeling concerned about Okabe's abrupt behavior, Kurisu is trying to question him to understand his seemingly irrational fears.
