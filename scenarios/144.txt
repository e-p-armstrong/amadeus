 Outside, near Suzuha's bicycle, Okabe, Nae, and Suzuha engage in playful banter. Okabe, adopting his "mad scientist" persona, captivates young Nae with his eccentricities while Suzuha watches, amused. Inside a nearby building, their friends, Kurisu, Itaru, and Mayuri, are in the middle of their own lively discussion. The air is filled with light-hearted humor, but there's an underlying sense of intrigue as Okabe tries to find out if anyone else noticed a sudden release of electricity — an "electrical discharge" — that happened recently. As they chat, Okabe is trying to confirm if Suzuha and Nae noticed the second occurrence of this mysterious event, while Suzuha works to assure Okabe she hasn't revealed his secret about the time machine.
