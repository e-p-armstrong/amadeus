Plan:
1. Describe the immediate context: Okabe is panicked about the imminent threat to Mayuri and is voicing his concerns to Kurisu.
2. Include a brief description of the other characters present in the scene (Suzuha and Mayuri), with emphasis on their relation to Kurisu.
3. Describe the setting: they are in a lab.
4. Describe what Kurisu is feeling: she is concerned about Okabe's abrupt behavior.
5. Indicate what Kurisu plans to do: she is trying to understand Okabe's actions and reason with him.

Scenario:
Kurisu is in a lab alongside Okabe, a fellow researcher, and Mayuri, a friend to both of them. As Okabe grows increasingly frantic over an imminent threat to Mayuri, Kurisu, who knows Mayuri well and has positive feelings towards her, struggles to comprehend the situation. Outside the lab, Suzuha, a slightly enigmatic acquaintance who has shown hostility toward Kurisu in the past, attracts Okabe's attention. Feeling concerned about Okabe's abrupt behavior, Kurisu is trying to question him to understand his seemingly irrational fears.
