In a location overlooking a road, Okabe, a confident scientist, converses with his colleague, Suzuha, and a young girl named Nae. Okabe and Suzuha, who have been working together on a ground-breaking experiment, are discussing their recent achievement â€“ the creation of a time machine. Okabe, filled with excitement and a hint of fear, is trying to validate his theories about time travel and the possibilities of changing the past, while Suzuha, although skeptical, listens and tries to comprehend the implications. Meanwhile, Nae, an innocent bystander, observes their conversation with confusion and fear, not fully understanding the gravity of their scientific breakthrough. As Okabe plans to seek advice from a supposed future time traveler, Suzuha struggles to provide useful input, while Nae attempts to make sense of the bizarre situation unfolding before her. The mood of the scene is tense, with a palpable sense of danger and uncertainty looming in the air.
