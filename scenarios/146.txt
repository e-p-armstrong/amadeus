Kurisu finds herself in a tense discussion among her friends, Okabe, Mayuri, and Daru, along with a stranger named Suzuha, who has just claimed to be a time traveler from the future. Okabe is a fellow researcher, Mayuri is a close friend, and Daru is a fellow scientist; Kurisu knows these three very well. The stranger, Suzuha, is a new acquaintance, having just confessed her startling origin. Amidst the confusion and disbelief, Kurisu attempts to question Suzuha's claim about SERN, a scientific institution, ruling the future, which contradicts what Kurisu knows and has previously explained online.
