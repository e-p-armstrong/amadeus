In a small electronics shop in Akihabara, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, finds himself in a tense exchange with Tennouji, the stern shop owner and his landlord. Okabe has recently witnessed a strange event - the sudden disappearance of everyone in the bustling district, and is eager to find answers. Leaving the shop and its confrontational atmosphere behind, Okabe retreats to his lab, a space filled with his friends and fellow scientists. As he arrives, the worried expressions of his friends meet him; Mayuri, a caring friend, tries to cheer him up with a plush toy, while Kurisu, a genius scientist with whom Okabe shares a complicated yet close relationship, remains in the lab, seemingly deep in thought. As Okabe grapples with his anxiety, his immediate goal is to contact a person named Titor for answers, while Kurisu, in the calm and introspective atmosphere of the lab, seems ready to engage in a thoughtful conversation with him.
