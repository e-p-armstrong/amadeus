Plan:
1. Begin with a description of the setting - a discussion between friends about a surprising revelation.
2. Introduce the other characters present in the conversation and their relation to Kurisu.
3. Describe the revelation that has been made and how it has impacted Kurisu and the group.
4. Conclude with Kurisu's intention to clarify a claim made during the discussion.

Scenario:
Kurisu finds herself in a tense discussion among her friends, Okabe, Mayuri, and Daru, along with a stranger named Suzuha, who has just claimed to be a time traveler from the future. Okabe is a fellow researcher, Mayuri is a close friend, and Daru is a fellow scientist; Kurisu knows these three very well. The stranger, Suzuha, is a new acquaintance, having just confessed her startling origin. Amidst the confusion and disbelief, Kurisu attempts to question Suzuha's claim about SERN, a scientific institution, ruling the future, which contradicts what Kurisu knows and has previously explained online.
