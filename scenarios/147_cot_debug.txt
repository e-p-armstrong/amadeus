Given the dialogue and the unspoken lines, it seems this scene is set in a lab where Okabe and Kurisu are together. The conversation indicates Okabe is about to send some emails and is worried about some unexpected changes. This could be after the discovery of their ability to send messages to the past and seeing its effects. The scene also indicates that Okabe is the only one who remembers changes in the timeline. This scene seems to be set after they have made multiple leaps, but Okabe feels out of place because only he remembers the changes. He is about to contact Titor, a character who helped them in the past, possibly about an issue related to their time travel experiments. 

The characters present are Okabe and Kurisu. They are colleagues and friends, with Okabe often giving Kurisu silly nicknames, which she dislikes. Despite their banter, they have a deep mutual respect and trust. Okabe is worried and confused about the changes in the timeline that only he seems to remember. Kurisu, on the other hand, is unaware of these changes and is engrossed in her book, seemingly relaxed.

The significant event leading to this scene would be their discovery of the ability to send messages to the past and the changes it has caused. During the scene, Okabe is about to contact Titor, seeking advice on their time travel anomalies. In Steins;Gate, Titor is a character who has previously helped them with a time machine issue. 

Okabe's goal in this scene is to get some answers and guidance from Titor and possibly to share his concerns with Kurisu. Kurisu's immediate goal seems to be to read her book, but her later responses indicate her readiness to listen to Okabe's concerns. 

The overall mood of the scene is tense and uneasy, as Okabe struggles with his memories of different timelines and his fear of further unexpected changes.

In this tense and uneasy atmosphere, Okabe seeks answers while Kurisu offers her quiet, supportive presence.
