Plan:
1. Start by explaining the tense situation they are in - a discussion about the future and their roles in it.
2. Briefly introduce the other characters in the scene, Itaru and Suzuha, as friends who are involved in the time-travel discussion.
3. Describe Kurisu's relation to the other characters - she knows them well as they work together.
4. Mention Kurisu's current state - she is surprised and in disbelief about what she hears about her future self.
5. Conclude with Kurisu's intention - she wants to understand and challenge the future description of her.

Scenario:
In a serious discussion about time travel and its implications, Kurisu finds herself in the company of her friends, Okabe, Itaru, and Suzuha. Itaru, a fellow scientist, and Suzuha, a known time traveler, are well known to Kurisu as they all work in the same research group. In the midst of the conversation, Suzuha shares predictions about their future selves, painting a disturbing picture of Kurisu's involvement in unethical experiments. Kurisu is taken aback by these revelations, unable to believe that she could be part of something so cruel in the future. Determined to get to the bottom of this, Kurisu challenges Suzuha's assertions and seeks to understand the circumstances leading to her future actions.
