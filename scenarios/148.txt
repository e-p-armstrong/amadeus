 Okabe and Kurisu are in their lab, a place of scientific discovery and invention, where they've been experimenting with a technology they refer to as D-mail, a concept that allows them to send messages to the past. They share a relationship of intellectual equals, but their dynamic is strained due to differing beliefs about the reality of their experiments. Okabe, who believes he alone has the ability to remember changes in the timeline - a phenomenon he's termed 'Reading Steiner' - is trying to convince a skeptical Kurisu of his experiences. Amidst their tense discussion, Okabe receives a lighthearted call from a friend, Itaru, who is at a local hangout spot called MayQueen, and has forgotten his wallet at the lab. Okabe, frustrated by Kurisu's skepticism and Itaru's trivialities, is attempting to maintain his self-proclaimed 'mad scientist' persona, while trying to understand the implications of their experiments. The overall mood of the scene oscillates between tense and frustrated, as Okabe deals with skepticism from his colleagues and unexpected interruptions.
