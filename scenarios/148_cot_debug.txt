Brainstorming: The scene seems to take place after Okabe has experienced changes in the timeline due to the D-mail but before everyone fully understands or believes in the concept. Okabe is trying to explain his experience to Kurisu, who remains skeptical. There's a shift in the scene when Okabe receives a call from Itaru, who is at a location called MayQueen, needing his wallet. The conversation then switches to Mayuri, who is with Itaru. Okabe seems to be in a frustrated state, while Kurisu is skeptical and Itaru and Mayuri are in lighter moods. Steins;Gate-specific terms include D-mail (a message that can be sent to the past), Reading Steiner (the ability to remember changes in timelines), and PhoneWave (the machine used to send D-mails). 

Scenario: Okabe and Kurisu are in their lab, a place of scientific discovery and invention, where they've been experimenting with a technology they refer to as D-mail, a concept that allows them to send messages to the past. They share a relationship of intellectual equals, but their dynamic is strained due to differing beliefs about the reality of their experiments. Okabe, who believes he alone has the ability to remember changes in the timeline - a phenomenon he's termed 'Reading Steiner' - is trying to convince a skeptical Kurisu of his experiences. Amidst their tense discussion, Okabe receives a lighthearted call from a friend, Itaru, who is at a local hangout spot called MayQueen, and has forgotten his wallet at the lab. Okabe, frustrated by Kurisu's skepticism and Itaru's trivialities, is attempting to maintain his self-proclaimed 'mad scientist' persona, while trying to understand the implications of their experiments. The overall mood of the scene oscillates between tense and frustrated, as Okabe deals with skepticism from his colleagues and unexpected interruptions.
