Within the cluttered confines of their makeshift laboratory, eccentric scientist Okabe, his intellectual sparring partner Kurisu, and his dutiful friend Itaru convene amidst a rising tension. Okabe has been engaged in an online correspondence with a supposed time traveler, John Titor, a conversation that has left him agitated and suspicious. As Okabe wrestles with his phone, Kurisu tries to make sense of his fluctuating moods, her confusion betrayed by her reddening ears and her intense focus on her book. Meanwhile, Itaru watches the scene, bemused and slightly concerned, as Okabe's behavior grows increasingly erratic. The trio stands on the precipice of a scientific breakthrough, their experimental device - the PhoneWave - which they believe can send messages to the past, serving as the backdrop to this unfolding drama. Okabe is desperate to unmask Titor as a fraud and test out the PhoneWave's capabilities, while Kurisu and Itaru strive to understand his sudden outburst. The atmosphere in the lab is electric, a charged mix of confusion, tension, and anticipation.
