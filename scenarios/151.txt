In a cramped lab filled with an amalgamation of high-tech equipment and ordinary household items, three friends and fellow scientists, Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru, huddle around their most ambitious creation: a device capable of sending messages to the past, the "PhoneWave". Okabe, a passionate and intense individual, is wrestling with a strange phenomenon â€” his ability to remember the original timeline when the past is altered, a trait he dubs the "Reading Steiner". Kurisu, pragmatic and weary, is skeptical about altering the past, despite her initial enthusiasm for their groundbreaking research. Itaru, on the other hand, is eager and ready to embrace the potential of their time-altering machine. The air in the lab is thick with tension, uncertainty, and hints of excitement as Okabe pushes for a repetition of their experiment to confirm his unique experience, Kurisu resists, and Itaru toes the line between caution and curiosity.
