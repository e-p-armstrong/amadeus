Brainstorming:
This scene takes place in the lab where Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru are gathered around their experimental time-travel device, the "PhoneWave". Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru are friends and fellow scientists, each with their unique perspectives on their ongoing research. Okabe is introspective, wrestling with the implications of their experiments and his unique ability to retain his memories when the past is altered, which he's named "Reading Steiner". Kurisu is pragmatic, seeming to be against the idea of changing the past despite her initial enthusiasm. Itaru is the most light-hearted of the three, seemingly ready to embrace the opportunity to change his past. Prior to this scene, the group has used the PhoneWave to send a message to the past, altering reality, and Okabe is the only one who remembers the original timeline. Okabe's goal in this scene is to convince the others to repeat the experiment to verify his experience, while Kurisu is wary and Itaru is eager. The overall mood is one of tension and uncertainty, with a hint of excitement.

Scenario:
In a cramped lab filled with an amalgamation of high-tech equipment and ordinary household items, three friends and fellow scientists, Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru, huddle around their most ambitious creation: a device capable of sending messages to the past, the "PhoneWave". Okabe, a passionate and intense individual, is wrestling with a strange phenomenon â€” his ability to remember the original timeline when the past is altered, a trait he dubs the "Reading Steiner". Kurisu, pragmatic and weary, is skeptical about altering the past, despite her initial enthusiasm for their groundbreaking research. Itaru, on the other hand, is eager and ready to embrace the potential of their time-altering machine. The air in the lab is thick with tension, uncertainty, and hints of excitement as Okabe pushes for a repetition of their experiment to confirm his unique experience, Kurisu resists, and Itaru toes the line between caution and curiosity.
