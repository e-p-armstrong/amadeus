Plan:
1. Start by explaining the situation in a generic way: the group has a damaged time machine and needs a certain computer to prevent a grim future.
2. Describe the setting as the lab where Kurisu and the others are gathered.
3. Mention the other characters in the scene and Kurisu's relation to them: Suzuha, the time traveler with the damaged machine; Itaru, another lab member; and Okabe, the group's leader.
4. Conclude with Kurisu's intention: to suggest using their own time leap machine to solve the problem.

Scenario:
Because of a damaged time machine that a group of friends has discovered, Kurisu is in their shared lab along with Okabe, the group's leader; Suzuha, who arrived from the future with the damaged machine; and Itaru, another member of their lab. Kurisu knows Suzuha as a time traveler, Itaru as a fellow lab member, and Okabe as a close ally. Despite the tension in the room, she's trying to find a solution to their problem by suggesting the use of another device they have: a time leap machine, which could allow them to avoid the damage to Suzuha's time machine.
