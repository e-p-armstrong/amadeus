 In a makeshift lab cluttered with electronic devices, three close friends and fellow scientists, Okabe, Itaru, and Kurisu, are in the midst of their time travel experiment. They are planning to send a D-Mail, a text message to the past, using their makeshift time machine, dubbed the 'PhoneWave'. Okabe, ever excited and confident, is ready to proceed with the experiment, while Itaru, brimming with anticipation, prepares to send the D-Mail. Meanwhile, Kurisu, known for her serious demeanor and analytical mind, questions Okabe about his unique ability to remember alternate timelines, expressing her reservations about altering the past. As they delve deeper into their experiment, the lab fills with a palpable tension, a mix of excitement for the unknown and worry over the ethical implications of their actions.
