 In a small, cluttered lab, friends and fellow scientists Okabe, Itaru, and Kurisu are testing their latest discovery - the ability to send messages to the past. Okabe, the group's eccentric leader, is grappling with an anomaly; he alone seems to remember these messages when they alter the timeline. Itaru, a skilled hacker and unabashed otaku, has just sent a message to his past self in an attempt to win a card game, but to his disappointment, the past seems unchanged. Kurisu, a pragmatic and brilliant scientist, is trying to make sense of the unfolding events and their implications. As confusion and frustration fill the room, each of them is striving to understand the rules and limitations of their groundbreaking discovery.
