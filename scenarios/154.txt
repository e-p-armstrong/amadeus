 In a makeshift lab, three friends - eccentric Okabe, eager Itaru, and genius scientist Kurisu - are working on a peculiar device they've nicknamed the 'PhoneWave', which has shown the ability to send messages to the past, or 'D-Mails'. Okabe and Itaru have been friends for a while, with Itaru often providing comic relief to the group, while Kurisu is a recent addition, her brilliant mind adding a new dynamic to their research. Itaru is desperate to use the PhoneWave to ensure his victory in a cooking competition, whereas Kurisu is intrigued by the science behind the device, even though her frustration with the makeshift lab's conditions is palpable. Okabe is trying to maintain a balance between Itaru's antics and Kurisu's scientific curiosity, all while grappling with the enigma of the PhoneWave himself. The atmosphere is a unique blend of light-hearted banter and serious scientific discovery, as they navigate the uncharted waters of their invention.
