Brainstorming: 
1. The scene takes place in a lab, where Okabe, Itaru, and Kurisu are present.
2. Okabe and Itaru are friends, and Kurisu is a genius scientist who recently joined their team. 
3. Okabe seems to be in a state of deep thought, Itaru is eager to win a cooking competition, and Kurisu is curious and slightly annoyed.
4. Leading up to this scene, the group has been experimenting with a device (PhoneWave) that can send messages to the past. They've done it successfully before but are now struggling to replicate the results.
5. Itaru's goal is to send a message to his past self that will ensure his victory in the competition, Kurisu is trying to understand how the PhoneWave works, and Okabe is moderating the situation while also trying to figure out the workings of the device.
6. The overall mood of the scene is a mix of frustration, curiosity, and levity.
7. The lines cover one scene only.

Steins;Gate-specific terms: 
1. PhoneWave: a device they've invented that can send messages to the past.
2. SERN: a research organization that has been mentioned in the context of creating black holes.
3. D-Mail: the messages they send to the past.

Scenario: In a makeshift lab, three friends - eccentric Okabe, eager Itaru, and genius scientist Kurisu - are working on a peculiar device they've nicknamed the 'PhoneWave', which has shown the ability to send messages to the past, or 'D-Mails'. Okabe and Itaru have been friends for a while, with Itaru often providing comic relief to the group, while Kurisu is a recent addition, her brilliant mind adding a new dynamic to their research. Itaru is desperate to use the PhoneWave to ensure his victory in a cooking competition, whereas Kurisu is intrigued by the science behind the device, even though her frustration with the makeshift lab's conditions is palpable. Okabe is trying to maintain a balance between Itaru's antics and Kurisu's scientific curiosity, all while grappling with the enigma of the PhoneWave himself. The atmosphere is a unique blend of light-hearted banter and serious scientific discovery, as they navigate the uncharted waters of their invention.
