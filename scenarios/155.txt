 It's a sunny morning near the Braun Tube Workshop, a quaint electronics store owned by Tennouji. Okabe, an eccentric character with a flair for theatrics, is engaged in a playful debate with Tennouji's young daughter, Nae, insisting she addresses him by the persona 'Kyouma.' Meanwhile, the kind-hearted Mayuri joins them, carrying a bag of convenience store food, her friendly demeanor bringing warmth to the scene. The group is waiting for others to arrive, hinting at a sort of gathering or experiment related to their makeshift time machine, the 'PhoneWave'. As they wait, Okabe is focused on maintaining his eccentric image, Mayuri continues to spread cheer with her food, and Nae tries to comprehend the adult's strange dynamics, setting a light-hearted and casual atmosphere.
