In a lab filled with the hum of machinery and the air of scientific pursuit, Okabe Rintaro and Shiina Mayuri are joined by Amane Suzuha, a part-time worker from a neighboring shop who shares their interest in the mysteries of time. Okabe and Mayuri, close friends bound by shared experiences, find their casual conversation interrupted by Suzuha's intense questioning about their online communication with an anonymous advisor, "Titor." As Mayuri tries to foster a friendly atmosphere, Okabe attempts to deflect Suzuha's probing questions. This scene unfolds under the shadow of their recent experiments with sending messages to the past, a venture that has resulted in unexpected consequences and led them to seek advice from the elusive Titor. As they navigate this delicate conversation, the arrival of another lab member, Makise Kurisu, introduces a new tension, as a yet unexplained animosity between her and Suzuha adds an undercurrent of hostility to the otherwise curious and tense atmosphere.
