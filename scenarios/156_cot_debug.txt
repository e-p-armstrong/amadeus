Plan:
1. Begin by explaining what is happening - Kurisu, Okabe, and Suzuha are working on a time machine.
2. Describe Kurisu's relation to the other characters - she works with Okabe and has just met Suzuha.
3. Discuss the reasons they are working on the time machine - they are trying to help Suzuha find her father.
4. End by stating Kurisu's intention - to reassure Okabe that she is not feeling conflicted about the task at hand and to continue working on the machine.

Scenario:
In a makeshift lab, Kurisu, Okabe, and Suzuha, a time traveler they've recently met, are engrossed in the task of building a time machine. Kurisu collaborates closely with Okabe on scientific matters, but she has only recently met Suzuha, who has come from the future with a broken time machine. The group's current task is driven by the need to repair Suzuha's time machine and to help her find her father. In the midst of their complex and challenging work, Kurisu decides to open up to Okabe about her views on time travel, aiming to assure him that she doesn't feel conflicted about their current project.
