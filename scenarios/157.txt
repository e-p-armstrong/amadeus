In a cluttered laboratory bustling with activity, Okabe, a lead scientist, is working alongside his colleagues Kurisu and Daru, and his childhood friend Mayuri. Engaged in a shared mission, they are trying to alter past events through a machine that allows them to send messages to the past, coined as "D-Mails". Their recent attempts at changing significant events have failed, leading to a tangible sense of frustration and determination in the room. In the present moment, Okabe proposes an experiment: Mayuri is to send a D-Mail to her past self, suggesting a different choice of canned food. The hope is that this minor alteration would be easier to manipulate and observe. As they prepare for the experiment, the room fills with an amalgamation of hope, anticipation, and tension, as they wait to see if their efforts will finally bear fruit.
