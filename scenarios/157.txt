In a secluded lab, Kurisu, Okabe, and their friend Suzuha have just completed the construction of a complex machine designed for time manipulation. Suzuha, a time traveler herself, gazes in awe at the device, while Okabe, who possesses the unique ability to remember events across different timelines, prepares for another experiment. Kurisu, a fellow scientist, and a close ally of Okabe, knows both Okabe and Suzuha well, having worked alongside them for a considerable duration. Currently, Kurisu is trying to understand the intricacies of Okabe's ability, known as 'Reading Steiner', and how it interacts with the time manipulation machine they've just built.
