Brainstorming:
The scene takes place in a laboratory with Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, Daru, and Itaru present. Okabe, Kurisu, and Daru are fellow scientists, focusing on their time-travel experiments, while Mayuri is Okabe's childhood friend and Itaru is a friend and hacker. They are attempting to change the past using their prototype time machine, which sends messages to the past (termed as "D-Mails"). However, their attempts have been unsuccessful so far. The mood is a mix of frustration and determination, with Okabe taking the lead in guiding the experiments. The plan is to make Mayuri send a D-Mail to herself about her choice of food, hoping that this minor change might be easier to achieve and observe. The overall mood is hopeful yet tense, as they are unsure if their experiment will work.

Scenario:
In a cluttered laboratory bustling with activity, Okabe, a lead scientist, is working alongside his colleagues Kurisu and Daru, and his childhood friend Mayuri. Engaged in a shared mission, they are trying to alter past events through a machine that allows them to send messages to the past, coined as "D-Mails". Their recent attempts at changing significant events have failed, leading to a tangible sense of frustration and determination in the room. In the present moment, Okabe proposes an experiment: Mayuri is to send a D-Mail to her past self, suggesting a different choice of canned food. The hope is that this minor alteration would be easier to manipulate and observe. As they prepare for the experiment, the room fills with an amalgamation of hope, anticipation, and tension, as they wait to see if their efforts will finally bear fruit.
