 In a makeshift laboratory, Okabe Rintaro, Kurisu Makise, Itaru Hashida, and Mayuri Shiina are huddled together, tweaking the settings of their experimental machine designed to send messages to the past. Okabe, a self-styled mad scientist, is leading this group of friends, grappling with frustration over the intricate process, while Kurisu, brilliant and skeptical, questions the basis of Itaru's suggestions for the machine's settings. Meanwhile, Mayuri, in her innocent and unique way, suggests altering the memory of what she ate the previous night, a suggestion that leaves the group both surprised and impressed. In the middle of their brainstorming session, Okabe receives numerous emails from Moeka Kiryu, a shy but persistent acquaintance who wants to take part in their experiments. As the group grapples with the heavy concept of changing the past and potential time paradoxes, Okabe contemplates whether to allow Moeka to participate, in hope of a breakthrough. The scene is a blend of tension and absurdity, as these friends navigate the complex world of time travel while dealing with mundane distractions.
