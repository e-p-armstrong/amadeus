 In the lab, a space filled with the energy of invention and discovery, Okabe Rintaro, Kurisu, Daru, Mayuri, and Moeka gather around their makeshift time machine—a modified microwave capable of sending text messages into the past. The dynamic between the characters is complex—Okabe shares a rivalry and mutual respect with Kurisu, while Daru is his best friend, Mayuri is like a sister to him, and Moeka is the new, quiet member they're still getting to know. As Okabe returns from an exchange with Moeka about her personal situation, they all engage in a discussion about an experiment involving sending a 'D-mail'. Okabe is intent on keeping the experiment focused and systematic, Kurisu advocates for the priority of data collection, while Mayuri and Daru offer a blend of moral support and humor. The scene is a cocktail of tension and camaraderie, as they navigate the serious implications of their work while cherishing the human connection they share.
