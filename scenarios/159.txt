Kurisu finds herself in an event hall with her group of friends, consisting of the eccentric Okabe, the friendly and innocent Mayuri, the laid-back Itaru, and a somewhat more distant acquaintance, Suzuha. Together, they are engaged in a playful conversation, started by Mayuri's outlandish claim that Itaru, despite his seemingly unlikely prospects, is Suzuha's father. Although Kurisu is well-acquainted with all present, she doesn't share the same close bond with Suzuha as the rest of the group. Undeterred by Mayuri's certainty, Kurisu, in true form, prepares to logically dispute the theory, believing it to be fundamentally flawed.
