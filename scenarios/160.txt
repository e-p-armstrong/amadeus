In a cluttered laboratory, a group of friends - Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, Itaru, and Moeka - gather around a unique device capable of sending messages back in time, known as 'D-mails'. This motley crew, led by the eccentric Okabe and tempered by the calm and astute Kurisu, are discussing the implications and possible uses of their groundbreaking discovery. Okabe, bubbling with excitement, is eager to push the boundaries of their invention, while Kurisu advocates for a more cautious approach. Meanwhile, Mayuri, ever the gentle soul, is more concerned about the welfare of her friends, especially the quiet and seemingly detached Moeka, who appears to have an idea she wants to share. Amidst the tense yet thrilling atmosphere, they collectively wrestle with the moral and practical challenges of their discovery, each hoping to guide its use in a way that aligns with their own principles and beliefs.
