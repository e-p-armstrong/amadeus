Kurisu finds herself in a lively discussion with her friends in a safe, private environment. Among them are Daru, a skilled hacker; Mayuri, a cheerful but non-technical member of the group; and Suzuha, a newcomer whose past and abilities are a mystery to everyone except Kurisu and Okabe. They're discussing the identity of a person from the future who has been interacting with them. Kurisu, who is well-acquainted with everyone present, listens attentively as Mayuri presents a theory that this person might be Daru. As Kurisu finds this theory plausible, she is trying to further explore this possibility with the group.
