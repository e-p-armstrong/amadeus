" In a cluttered, buzzing laboratory, three scientists - Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru - are preparing to execute an experiment that can send messages to the past, using a device they've been engineering. Okabe and Kurisu have a complex relationship, marked by banter and intellectual rivalry, while Itaru, the tech wizard, looks up to Okabe. As they set up the experiment, Okabe, the self-proclaimed mad scientist, is trying to keep the mood light with his eccentric bravado, despite the underlying tension. Kurisu, the genius scientist, is focused and pragmatic, pushing them to start. Itaru, caught between admiration for Okabe and concern for the consequences, provides a reality check. The goal of the experiment is to send a message, referred to as a "D-Mail", to the past from a woman named Moekaâ€™s phone. As they activate the device, the atmosphere in the room changes dramatically - a physical and emotional upheaval occurs, hinting at a successful transmission, but when the chaos subsides, Moeka has vanished. The scene is filled with a mix of scientific excitement and looming dread.
