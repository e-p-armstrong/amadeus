Kurisu is gathered at their usual hangout with Okabe and their mutual friends, Mayuri, Daru, and Suzuha. They are engrossed in a lively conversation about the identity of Suzuha's father. Mayuri, an endearing, often oblivious friend, and Daru, a talented hacker with a knack for puns, are both closely connected to Kurisu through shared scientific endeavors. Suzuha is a new addition to their group, her origins and identity still a mystery to them. In this situation, Kurisu is actively participating in the conversation, trying to make sense of the clues and help uncover the truth about Suzuha's parentage.
