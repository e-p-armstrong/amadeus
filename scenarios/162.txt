In the cluttered, gadget-filled space of their makeshift laboratory, Okabe, a passionate yet eccentric scientist, shares the room with his fellow researchers, the rational and sharp-minded Kurisu and the tech-savvy Itaru, along with his caring childhood friend Mayuri. Having spent considerable time together working on a series of time-bending experiments, the team shares a strong bond, albeit often tested by the unexpected and alarming consequences of their breakthroughs. Okabe, unusually frantic and pale, is wrestling with the fear that he has erased the existence of Moeka, a friend, through one such experiment involving messages sent to the past, known as D-Mails. As Okabe's unique ability to retain memories across altered timelines—the so-called "Reading Steiner"—kicks in, he desperately tries to contact Moeka, while his colleagues, puzzled and concerned, grapple with the sudden revelation. The atmosphere is heavy with tension and uncertainty, as Okabe fights to refute the horrifying possibility of his actions, and his friends strive to comprehend the inexplicable situation.
