Brainstorming:

1. The scene likely takes place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, as that is where most of the experiments and discussions about time travel occur.
2. The characters present are Okabe, Kurisu, Itaru (Daru), and Mayuri. Okabe, Kurisu, and Daru are fellow scientists who have been working together on time travel experiments. Mayuri is Okabe's childhood friend who often hangs out at the lab.
3. Okabe seems panicked and desperate, as he believes he might have erased Moeka from existence. The others, unaware of Moeka's existence, are confused and concerned about Okabe's state.
4. D-Mails are messages sent to the past. Okabe and his team have been using them to change past events, but Okabe is the only one who remembers the original timeline due to his special ability, which he calls "Reading Steiner". In this scene, Okabe has just sent a D-mail on behalf of Moeka, a friend, and is now realizing that no one else remembers her.
5. Okabe's goal is to confirm that Moeka still exists, while the others are trying to understand what's going on.
6. The mood is tense and anxious, as Okabe struggles with the potential consequences of their experiments.

Scenario:

In the cluttered, gadget-filled space of their makeshift laboratory, Okabe, a passionate yet eccentric scientist, shares the room with his fellow researchers, the rational and sharp-minded Kurisu and the tech-savvy Itaru, along with his caring childhood friend Mayuri. Having spent considerable time together working on a series of time-bending experiments, the team shares a strong bond, albeit often tested by the unexpected and alarming consequences of their breakthroughs. Okabe, unusually frantic and pale, is wrestling with the fear that he has erased the existence of Moeka, a friend, through one such experiment involving messages sent to the past, known as D-Mails. As Okabe's unique ability to retain memories across altered timelines—the so-called "Reading Steiner"—kicks in, he desperately tries to contact Moeka, while his colleagues, puzzled and concerned, grapple with the sudden revelation. The atmosphere is heavy with tension and uncertainty, as Okabe fights to refute the horrifying possibility of his actions, and his friends strive to comprehend the inexplicable situation.
