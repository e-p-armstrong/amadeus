Plan:
1. Set up the context of the scene with everyone in the lab watching as Suzuha leaves in her time machine.
2. Mention that Kurisu, along with Okabe and Daru, has just been entrusted with a mission to change the future by Suzuha.
3. Describe the sense of urgency felt by Kurisu and others due to an impending attack.
4. Conclude with what Kurisu is attempting to do - escape unnoticed and quickly return to the lab.

Scenario:
In a tense atmosphere, Kurisu, Okabe, and their friend Daru watch as their time-travelling companion, Suzuha, departs for her mission. The trio has just been entrusted with the task of changing the future, a mission passed on to them by Suzuha. They stand amidst a crowd, unobserved in the ensuing chaos caused by the sudden disappearance of Suzuha's time machine. They feel an urgency, aware of a looming attack on their lab. Kurisu, catching her breath after a hurried escape, is attempting to quickly return to the lab unnoticed and prepare for the impending crisis.
