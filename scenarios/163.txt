 
In the cluttered lab that serves as their makeshift research facility, Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru gather to discuss the implications of their recent experiments with time. Despite their shared camaraderie, a sense of unease permeates the atmosphere, particularly around Okabe, who is grappling with the fear of having potentially erased someone's existence by sending messages — or "D-mails" — to the past through their experimental machine, the PhoneWave. His friends provide varying degrees of comfort and distraction: Kurisu, with her analytical mind and scientific theories; Mayuri, with her cheerful naivety; and Itaru, with his casual and light-hearted demeanor. Nevertheless, the weight of their actions bears down heavily, especially on Okabe, who alone possesses the 'Reading Steiner', an ability to remember original timelines. As they navigate this uncertain terrain, each character strives to understand and come to terms with the potentially far-reaching consequences of their actions. The overall mood of the scene is a tense blend of fear, uncertainty, and relief.
