Plan:
1. Begin by describing the setting - in the lab, with Kurisu, Okabe, Daru, Mayuri, and Tennouji.
2. Explain the relationship between Kurisu and the other characters present - she's a close friend of Okabe, Daru, and Mayuri, and knows Tennouji as the landlord.
3. Mention the ongoing conversation about time travel and its implications, which is the context of the scene.
4. End by stating Kurisu's intention, which is to prevent Mayuri from revealing sensitive information about Suzuha's time travel to Tennouji.

Scenario:
Following a discussion on time travel, Kurisu finds herself in the lab with her close friends, Okabe, Daru, and Mayuri. As they chat, Tennouji, their landlord, interrupts with a knock on the door. Kurisu knows Tennouji, but isn't as close to him as she is with the others present. The conversation had taken a turn towards the implications of time travel on personal relationships, and as Mayuri begins to divulge information that could potentially expose their secret, Kurisu's main concern becomes preventing Mayuri from revealing too much to Tennouji.
