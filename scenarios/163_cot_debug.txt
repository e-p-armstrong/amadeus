Brainstorm:
The scene takes place after the group has discovered their ability to send messages back in time and has witnessed the changes such manipulations can cause. The characters present are Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru. They are all lab members and friends, though Okabe and Kurisu also share a complex relationship that oscillates between rivalry and mutual support. Okabe is anxious due to the potential consequences of their actions, Kurisu is analytical and somewhat detached, Mayuri is naive and cheerful, and Itaru is casual and light-hearted. The significant events are the sending of D-mails (messages to the past) and the uncertainty of their effects. The goals of each character in the scene are to understand and discuss the consequences of their actions, with Okabe being particularly concerned about whether they have erased someone's existence. The mood of the scene is tense and uncertain, with a mix of fear and relief.

Special terms: D-Mail (a message sent to the past), PhoneWave (the machine they use to send D-mails), Reading Steiner (Okabe's ability to remember original timelines).

Scenario: 
In the cluttered lab that serves as their makeshift research facility, Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru gather to discuss the implications of their recent experiments with time. Despite their shared camaraderie, a sense of unease permeates the atmosphere, particularly around Okabe, who is grappling with the fear of having potentially erased someone's existence by sending messages — or "D-mails" — to the past through their experimental machine, the PhoneWave. His friends provide varying degrees of comfort and distraction: Kurisu, with her analytical mind and scientific theories; Mayuri, with her cheerful naivety; and Itaru, with his casual and light-hearted demeanor. Nevertheless, the weight of their actions bears down heavily, especially on Okabe, who alone possesses the 'Reading Steiner', an ability to remember original timelines. As they navigate this uncertain terrain, each character strives to understand and come to terms with the potentially far-reaching consequences of their actions. The overall mood of the scene is a tense blend of fear, uncertainty, and relief.
