Scenario: 

In a lab filled with scientific equipment and clutter, friends Okabe, Mayuri, and Itaru are gathered, joined by Kurisu, a newcomer to their group. Okabe and Kurisu have a unique dynamic, a blend of slight tension and shared intellect, while Mayuri and Itaru are more relaxed around Okabe. At the start of this scene, Okabe is experiencing pain related to his "Reading Steiner," a self-coined term for his ability to perceive shifts in timelines. This pain triggers a dramatic outburst from Okabe, causing concern amongst his friends, particularly Mayuri, who tries to comfort him. Okabe, in his discomfort, is bent on avoiding Kurisu's probing questions about his Reading Steiner, while Mayuri seeks to help him, Itaru questions Okabe's honesty, and Kurisu strives to understand the strange dynamic unfolding before her. The overall mood is a chaotic mix of concern, confusion, and underlying camaraderie.
