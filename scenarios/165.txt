In a tranquil evening outside Akihabara Station, Okabe, Mayuri, and Kurisu, three close friends bound by shared experiences, exchange casual goodbyes. Okabe and Kurisu's relationship is marked by the trials they've weathered together, their bond deepened through the shared burden of altering timelines. As they part ways, Kurisu, a genius scientist who has found a sense of belonging with these friends, extends an invitation to Mayuri, a cheerful and caring soul, to visit her hotel. As Kurisu leaves, Mayuri begins an ancient ritual, "Stardust Handshake," reaching towards the stars as if to grasp them, and a shooting star crosses the sky. Mayuri reminisces about a time when Okabe was critically ill, sharing how she wished upon a shooting star for his recovery, her goal being to share her past feelings and experiences with Okabe, who is striving to cherish and preserve the peacefulness they have achieved. The mood is a peaceful and nostalgic calm, a moment of respite filled with shared memories and strengthened bonds.
