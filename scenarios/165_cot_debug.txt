Scenario:
In the silence of their lab, Okabe and Kurisu are grappling with the aftermath of a shared friend's suicide. Okabe, overwhelmed with grief, is comforted by Mayuri, a close friend to both him and Kurisu, while Daru, another well-known friend, is engrossed in his own thoughts at his computer. Kurisu, a brilliant scientist, is occupied with a news report about a missing satellite, but her attention shifts when she notices Okabe's erratic behavior. Seeing Okabe activate the time machine, Kurisu, concerned about his intentions, attempts to intervene and understand what he is planning to do.
