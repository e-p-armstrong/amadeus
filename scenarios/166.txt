Inside a lab characterized by a casual and somewhat chaotic atmosphere, four individuals - Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist with a flair for melodrama; Itaru, a tech-savvy friend of Okabe; Mayuri, Okabe's childhood friend who serves as a calming presence in the lab; and Luka, a gentle, shy boy who knows Mayuri from school - are gathered. Okabe is preoccupied with thoughts about a recent disappearance of a friend, Moeka, and his unique ability to remember changes in timelines, a phenomenon he's named "Reading Steiner." Meanwhile, the others engage in playful banter about Luka's lack of a prop sword for an imagined duel. This light-hearted exchange is interrupted when Okabe invites Luka to join their scientific endeavors in the lab, an offer which leads to a discussion about Luka participating in a cosplay fitting session with Mayuri. While Okabe aims to ease his worries and lift his spirits through the playful banter, Mayuri is determined to ensure that Luka feels comfortable and welcome in the lab. The overall mood of the scene oscillates between contemplative and light-hearted, reflecting the lab's unique blend of serious scientific endeavors and playful camaraderie.
