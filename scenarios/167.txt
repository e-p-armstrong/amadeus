 

In a casual indoor setting, four friends - Okabe, Mayuri, Luka, and Itaru - are gathered. Mayuri, a cheerful girl known for her creative pursuits, has crafted a costume that she's eager for the shy and hesitant Luka to try on. Okabe, who often takes on a mentor-like role for Luka, is encouraging him to accept the challenge, while Itaru adds humor with his offbeat observations. This scene follows Mayuri's extensive efforts in sewing the costume, a labor of love that she hopes won't be in vain. As the friends navigate this playful encounter, their goals are clear: Mayuri seeks to see her creation come to life on Luka, Luka grapples with his embarrassment, Okabe tries to persuade Luka, and Itaru injects levity into the situation. The overall mood is jovial and light-hearted, a moment of youthful camaraderie and fun.
