Scenario:
In a tense atmosphere, Kurisu is present at the lab along with Okabe and their friends, Daru and Mayuri. Okabe, who has been acting out of character due to his anxiety over a potential threat, is trying to ensure everyone's safety. Kurisu, who is well acquainted with both Daru, a tech-savvy but laid-back friend, and Mayuri, Okabe's cheerful and innocent childhood friend, is having a casual dinner with them. Amidst the palpable tension, Kurisu is trying to maintain a sense of normality and is focused on finishing her meal.
