Plan:
1. Start by describing the setting - they are in the lab, which is their usual meeting place.
2. Describe the other characters in the scene, Mayuri and Okabe, and how Kurisu knows them. Since we're assuming familiarity with Kurisu, we already know about her relationship with Okabe, but we need to mention her relationship with Mayuri (that they're friends).
3. Explain the immediate context - Okabe has been acting more protective of Mayuri, which Kurisu has noticed.
4. Conclude with Kurisu's intention - to question Okabe about his relationship with Mayuri.

Scenario:
In the familiar setting of the lab, Kurisu spends another day working alongside Okabe and Mayuri, who she knows as fellow lab members and friends. Okabe, known for his eccentric behavior, has been unusually protective towards Mayuri, his childhood friend, which hasn't escaped Kurisu's observant eye. The change in Okabe's behavior towards Mayuri sparks questions in Kurisu's mind. She decides to confront Okabe, aiming to understand the nature of his relationship with Mayuri, and the reason behind his sudden shift in behavior.
