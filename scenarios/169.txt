In the vibrant laboratory of the self-proclaimed mad scientist, Okabe, a lively conversation is unfolding among a group of friends. The group includes Okabe, the eccentric scientist with a flair for the dramatic, Kurisu, a genius yet naive about certain matters, Mayuri, an innocent and bubbly character, Itaru, the group's tech expert, and Lukako, a boy with a feminine appearance. Okabe, Mayuri, and Itaru harbor a secret about Lukako's gender, which Kurisu is oblivious of. The atmosphere is jovial, as they engage in a playful discussion about cosplay, a popular aspect of Japanese animation culture, and their individual wishes. The scene takes a turn when Okabe, attempting to divert attention from Lukako's discomfort, proposes that their wishes could be granted by the 'Steins Gate', a term he uses to describe a sort of mystical force. The overall mood of the scene is upbeat and playful, with a hint of tension due to Lukako's secret.
