At the Future Gadget Laboratory, a small, cluttered apartment that serves as a hub for a group of eccentric friends and amateur scientists, Okabe, Kurisu, Luka, Itaru, and Mayuri are engrossed in a peculiar discussion. Okabe and Kurisu, the group's intellectual powerhouses, are locked in a heated debate, while Luka, a delicate boy with feminine qualities, watches uncomfortably, his wish to be a girl being the topic of the argument. Itaru, the tech whiz with a penchant for humor, attempts to lighten the mood, while Mayuri, Okabe's naive childhood friend, grapples with the complexity of the conversation. The argument is the result of a recent exploration into the possibilities of altering reality, sparked by Luka's wish. Despite the intensity of the debate, the friends are all striving to understand each other's perspectives and find a solution to their dilemma, creating a scene that is both tense and humorous.
