 In the confines of a scientific lab, colleagues and friends Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru are engaged in a lively discussion with Luka, a friend less familiar with their scientific pursuits. The air is filled with a mix of light-hearted banter and serious contemplation as they discuss a peculiar experiment involving their PhoneWave, a device that can send text messages, referred to as D-Mails, back in time. Okabe, ever the decisive figure, is proposing they use the PhoneWave to send a D-Mail to Luka's mother in the past, suggesting a dietary change that could potentially alter Luka's gender at birth. Kurisu, quick to grasp the implications, grapples with the ethical and personal issues tied to the experiment, while Mayuri and Luka struggle to understand the situation. Itaru, on the other hand, voices concern over the potential consequences of such an experiment. As the discussion unfolds, the mood in the room swings between camaraderie and scientific curiosity, but underpinning it all is a sense of apprehension about the proposed experiment.
