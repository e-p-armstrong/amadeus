 In the bustling lab filled with eccentric inventors, Okabe, the self-proclaimed mad scientist, is surrounded by his friends and fellow lab members: Kurisu, the genius newcomer; Mayuri, his loyal childhood friend; Daru, the resident tech expert; and Luka, the soft-spoken newcomer who dreams of being a girl. They've just discovered that their microwave can send text messages to the past, which they call "D-Mails", and are excitedly planning to use it to grant Luka's wish. However, the mood turns tense as Okabe realizes a potential issue: to change Luka's gender, they need to send a D-Mail to a year when cellphones, the D-Mail's recipient, weren't yet popular. Each member starts brainstorming, trying to think of ways to overcome this challenge, turning the lab into a hotbed of ideas, debates, and friendly banter. The scene is a lively blend of excitement, anticipation, and frustration as they struggle to make their newfound discovery work for their friend.
