In a cluttered lab, brimming with scientific equipment, Okabe, Itaru, Luka, Mayuri, and Kurisu gather around a peculiar device they've christened the "PhoneWave" â€” a makeshift time machine capable of sending text messages into the past. As co-researchers, they have experienced a myriad of successes and failures together, developing a camaraderie that is evident in their banter and shared excitement. Okabe, the group's eccentric lead, is fueled by a spark of inspiration, while Itaru, the resident skeptic, questions Okabe's latest idea. Luka, shy and hesitant, has been roped into this experiment due to his mother's ownership of a pager, an essential component for Okabe's plan. Encouraged by Mayuri's cheerfulness and guided by Kurisu's practical approach, the group prepares to send a message to the past via the pager. The atmosphere is charged with anticipation and a dash of tension as they embark on this uncharted endeavor.
