 Inside the cluttered Future Gadget Laboratory, Okabe Rintaro, Itaru Hashida, Mayuri Shiina, Kurisu Makise, and Luka Urushibara are gathered around an odd contraption - a microwave, now acting as a rudimentary time machine. The group, made up of friends and fellow scientists, are united by a shared discovery and a common goal - to send a message to Luka's mother in the past that could potentially change Luka's gender at birth. While the mood is light-hearted and the banter is playful, the task at hand is serious, and the air is filled with anticipation and a hint of anxiety. The group is brainstorming on how to construct the perfect message, one that would convince Luka's mother to eat more vegetables during her pregnancy, a superstition believed to influence a baby's gender. Their goal is to encode their message into numbers, input it into their makeshift time machine, and hope that it reaches its destination in the past. The overall mood of the scene is one of camaraderie and light-hearted tension, a group of friends trying to navigate an unprecedented situation with humour and determination.
