The scene takes place at a lab, where Okabe, Luka, Mayuri, Kurisu, and Itaru are present. The relationship between them is that of friends and fellow scientists. Okabe seems perplexed and a bit frustrated due to his unique ability to remember changes in timelines, which the others can't. The significant event leading up to this scene is that they used a prototype time machine (PhoneWave) to try to change Luka's gender, but the experiment seemingly failed. Okabe's goal in the scene is to understand what went wrong and to figure out the changes in the timeline. The overall mood of the scene is confusion mixed with light-hearted humor.
