 In a lively and welcoming cafe, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is engaged in an animated discussion with his friend and collaborator, Itaru, about their ambitious time travel project. Their conversation revolves around a device they've been working on, a machine that can send messages to the past, which Okabe optimistically refers to as the "PhoneWave". Faris, a playful and outgoing cafe worker and friend of the duo, serves them food and drinks while participating in their banter. Despite their lack of progress, Okabe is determined to improve the PhoneWave, holding onto his dream of not only sending messages to the past, but also the future. As they navigate the challenges of their project, the trio maintains a light-hearted and positive atmosphere, their interactions filled with camaraderie and friendly teasing.
