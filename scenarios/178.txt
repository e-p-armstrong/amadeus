 

In a casual setting, friends Okabe, Faris and Itaru find themselves engaged in a lively conversation. Faris, known for her playful curiosity, has overheard Okabe and Itaru discussing a machine they've been working on, one that can send messages to the past, and she's eager to understand more. Okabe, the more reserved of the group, is reluctant to share too much information about their secret project, while Itaru, enthusiastic and somewhat naive, is more open about their work. A deep philosophical discussion ensues as they explore the concept of time, with Faris posing thought-provoking questions and the others attempting to provide answers based on their own understanding and experiences. Their collective goal is to grasp the nature of time, a concept that has suddenly become a tangible part of their lives. The atmosphere is light-hearted yet intellectually challenging as they navigate this complex topic together.
