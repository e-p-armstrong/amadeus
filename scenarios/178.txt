Following a series of experiments that have led to unwanted consequences, Kurisu is in a discussion with Okabe, a fellow scientist and friend, about how to undo these effects. They are at their usual gathering place, a makeshift laboratory, where they often brainstorm on their scientific endeavors. In this scene, they're discussing two other acquaintances, Lukako and Kiryu Moeka, who have also been affected by their experiments. Kurisu knows all of them quite well; she has been working closely with Okabe and has interacted with both Lukako and Moeka in the course of their experiments. As they discuss, Kurisu is trying to help Okabe figure out a way to cancel the effects of their experiments, specifically focusing on the ones involving Lukako and Moeka.
