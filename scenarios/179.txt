 In the casual setting of MayQueen, friends and fellow science enthusiasts, Okabe, Daru, and Faris, engross themselves in a lively discussion about the perplexing theories of time travel. Their camaraderie is evident, despite their differing opinions on the implications of their recent experiment - a time machine they've managed to operate successfully. Faris, the skeptic, prods Okabe and Daru with questions, testing their conviction, while the two men, filled with excitement, try to convince her of their groundbreaking achievement. Meanwhile, another member of their team, Kurisu, is found outside their usual meeting place, the Braun Tube Workshop, engaged in an upsetting phone call that leaves her in tears. The scene's mood transitions from a light-hearted intellectual exchange to a more somber tone as Okabe discovers Kurisu's distress, setting the stage for an emotional encounter.
