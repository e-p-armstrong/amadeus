In the Future Gadget Laboratory, a place filled with an assortment of odd inventions, Okabe, an eccentric self-proclaimed mad scientist, finds himself in a tense conversation with Kurisu, a young genius scientist. Their shared passion for science and time-travel experimentation has bonded them closely over time. However, the usually logical and composed Kurisu is currently acting out of character, her eyes red from crying, and she adamantly denies her emotional distress. Her upset state may be a result of personal sacrifices they had to make in their recent experiments, which involved sending messages to the past with unintended consequences. Her goal in this scene is to maintain a facade of strength, denying her emotional vulnerability, while Okabe seeks to understand and offer her comfort. The scene is emotionally charged, filled with tension and an underlying sadness.
