Brainstorm:
1. The scene likely takes place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, where Okabe, Kurisu and Mayuri usually spend their time. The only characters present are Okabe and Kurisu.
2. Okabe and Kurisu share a close relationship born from a shared interest in science and time-travel, as well as shared experiences with the trials and tribulations that come from their experiments.
3. Kurisu is emotionally distressed, indicated by her previous crying and current defensive behavior. Okabe is trying to understand her emotional state and provide comfort.
4. Kurisu's emotional distress might be related to the personal pain caused by the undoing of the D-mails or perhaps another significant event.
5. Kurisu's goal is to deny her emotional vulnerability and maintain a facade of strength, while Okabe is trying to offer support and comfort.
6. The overall mood of the scene is tense and emotionally charged, with an undercurrent of sadness.

Scenario:
In the Future Gadget Laboratory, a place filled with an assortment of odd inventions, Okabe, an eccentric self-proclaimed mad scientist, finds himself in a tense conversation with Kurisu, a young genius scientist. Their shared passion for science and time-travel experimentation has bonded them closely over time. However, the usually logical and composed Kurisu is currently acting out of character, her eyes red from crying, and she adamantly denies her emotional distress. Her upset state may be a result of personal sacrifices they had to make in their recent experiments, which involved sending messages to the past with unintended consequences. Her goal in this scene is to maintain a facade of strength, denying her emotional vulnerability, while Okabe seeks to understand and offer her comfort. The scene is emotionally charged, filled with tension and an underlying sadness.
