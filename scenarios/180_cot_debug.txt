Plan:
1. Start by describing the setting and what led them there - Okabe and Kurisu trying to get someone (in this case, Lukako) for their experiment at the lab.
2. Describe the relationship between Okabe, Kurisu, and Lukako and how Kurisu is a part of Okabe's team. 
3. Mention how well Kurisu knows Lukako and why she is interested in her.
4. Specify Kurisu's current state and intentions - trying to convince Lukako to be a part of their experiment without scaring her away.

Scenario:
Due to their need for a test subject for an experiment at their lab, Kurisu and Okabe find themselves attempting to convince Lukako to participate. Kurisu, a member of Okabe's team, is acquainted with Lukako but doesn't know her very well. However, she recognizes Lukako's potential value to their ongoing project. She is trying to persuade Lukako to join their experiment, while also trying to avoid frightening her off with the prospect.
