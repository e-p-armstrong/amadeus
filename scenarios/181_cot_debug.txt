Scenario: 
In the cluttered, eccentric atmosphere of a makeshift lab, long-time friends Okabe and Mayuri share a leisurely moment. Okabe, the self-proclaimed mad scientist, and Mayuri, a gentle, hobbyist costume-maker, engage in a casual conversation. Okabe is curious about Mayuri's ambitions, while Mayuri is enamored with the simple joy her hobby brings. The lab they are in, once a quiet refuge for their shared dreams, has recently grown with new members, a fact that Mayuri proudly acknowledges. As the conversation unfolds, Okabe seeks to understand Mayuri's future aspirations, and Mayuri strives to articulate her satisfaction with the present, resulting in a light-hearted and warm exchange.
