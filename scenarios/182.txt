In a cramped, peculiarly decorated lab during the heat of summer, the members of the Future Gadget Laboratory — Okabe Rintaro, the enthusiastic and eccentric leader; Kurisu Makise, the genius scientist; Mayuri Shiina, the innocent and cheerful childhood friend of Okabe; and Itaru Hashida, the tech-savvy otaku — are gathered around. Their bond is marked by playful banter, teasing, and a shared sense of curiosity about the mysteries of time travel. Despite the casual atmosphere, there is a sense of tension and anticipation as they are in the midst of their research on a device capable of sending messages — which they affectionately termed 'D-Mail' — into the past. Okabe is eager to push forward the progress of their experiment, Kurisu, though complaining about the summer heat and the company, shows a dedicated interest in the project, Mayuri attempts to maintain peace and enjoy her meal amidst the discussion, and Itaru lightens the mood with his humorous comments. The scene is filled with a blend of scientific intrigue, light-hearted camaraderie, and the distinct quirkiness that defines their collective dynamic.
