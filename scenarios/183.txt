 
In a cluttered, makeshift lab filled with an assortment of unlikely time travel equipment, eccentric scientist Okabe Rintaro gathers his team: the genius yet pragmatic Kurisu Makise, the cheerful and oblivious Mayuri Shiina, and the tech-savvy Itaru Hashida. Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru, with their shared knowledge and ambition, often engage in complex scientific discussions, while Mayuri provides a lighthearted and innocent perspective. Despite the heavy atmosphere of scientific discourse, Mayuri remains blissfully ignorant, lightening the mood with her playful remarks, while the others grapple with the implications of their recent discovery â€“ a way to send text messages to the past, termed "D-Mails." Okabe, driven by ambition and curiosity, is pushing for the next big leap - physical time travel, while Kurisu and Itaru, cautious and skeptical, question the feasibility and danger of such an endeavor, referring to their limited understanding of key mechanisms and the potential risk of becoming a jelly-like organism, or a "jellyman," a term coined to describe the failed experiments of SERN, a powerful research organization. The overall mood of the scene is tense and serious, with a touch of humor added by Mayuri's innocence, as they wrestle with the scientific and ethical complexities of their potential next step.
