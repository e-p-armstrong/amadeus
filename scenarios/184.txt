In a humble lab cluttered with electronics, four friends are embroiled in a tense discussion. Kurisu, a serious and focused scientist, argues with Okabe, a playful and defiant self-proclaimed "mad scientist". Also present are Itaru, a skilled hacker and Okabe's loyal friend, and Mayuri, a sweet and naive girl who is visibly frightened by their conversation.

The group has recently made a groundbreaking discovery: they've invented a device, the PhoneWave, that can send messages to the past. In addition, they've successfully hacked into the systems of a major research institution, SERN, potentially putting them in danger.

Kurisu argues for caution, urging them to hand over their invention to a proper research institution. Okabe, however, dismisses her concerns, eager to continue experimenting and maintain their independence. Meanwhile, Itaru is focused on maintaining control over SERN's system without getting caught, and Mayuri is trying to make sense of the situation.

The overall mood is one of apprehension and tension, with a dash of humor provided by Okabe's eccentricity.
