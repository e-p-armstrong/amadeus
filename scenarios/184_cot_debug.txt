Brainstorming and Planning:

The scene most likely occurs in the lab after the characters have discovered their ability to send messages to the past using the PhoneWave, a device they've invented, and have hacked into SERN, a large research institution. The named characters present are Kurisu, Okabe, Itaru (Daru), and Mayuri. 

In terms of relationships, Okabe and Kurisu are fellow scientists who often disagree, but have a mutual respect for each other. Itaru is Okabe's friend and a skilled hacker, and Mayuri is also a close friend of Okabe's with a more innocent and naive personality.

Emotionally, Kurisu is concerned and serious, trying to persuade the group to exercise caution and consider surrendering their invention to a proper research institution. Okabe is defiant and playful, dismissing her concerns and wanting to continue their experiments. Itaru is focused and cautious as he handles the hacking, while Mayuri is scared and confused by the situation.

The significant event leading up to this scene is the discovery of the PhoneWave's ability and the successful hacking into SERN. During the scene, they are discussing the ramifications of their actions and the potential danger they might be in.

The characters' goals are: Kurisu wants to protect the group and ensure their discovery is used responsibly; Okabe wants to continue their experiments and maintain their independence; Itaru wants to maintain control over SERN's system without getting caught; Mayuri wants to understand and deal with the situation.

The overall mood of the scene is tense and apprehensive, with a touch of humor due to Okabe's eccentricity.

Special terms:
- PhoneWave: A device invented by the characters that can send messages to the past.
- SERN: A large research institution that the characters have hacked into.

Scenario:

In a humble lab cluttered with electronics, four friends are embroiled in a tense discussion. Kurisu, a serious and focused scientist, argues with Okabe, a playful and defiant self-proclaimed "mad scientist". Also present are Itaru, a skilled hacker and Okabe's loyal friend, and Mayuri, a sweet and naive girl who is visibly frightened by their conversation.

The group has recently made a groundbreaking discovery: they've invented a device, the PhoneWave, that can send messages to the past. In addition, they've successfully hacked into the systems of a major research institution, SERN, potentially putting them in danger.

Kurisu argues for caution, urging them to hand over their invention to a proper research institution. Okabe, however, dismisses her concerns, eager to continue experimenting and maintain their independence. Meanwhile, Itaru is focused on maintaining control over SERN's system without getting caught, and Mayuri is trying to make sense of the situation.

The overall mood is one of apprehension and tension, with a dash of humor provided by Okabe's eccentricity.
