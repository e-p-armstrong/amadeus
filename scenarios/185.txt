Okabe finds himself at a shrine, sharing a heartfelt conversation with Luka, a friend he's known for some time. Kurisu, a fellow researcher and friend, is not present at the shrine but is able to communicate with Okabe. She knows both Okabe and Luka well enough to be concerned about their well-being. Okabe, after his emotional exchange with Luka, contacts Kurisu unexpectedly regarding a piece of tech they've been working on, the PhoneWave. Caught off guard and puzzled by Okabe's request, Kurisu seeks to understand what's going on and why Okabe needs her to input a number into the device.
