In the cluttered lab, Okabe Rintaro is in a state of panic, his friends and fellow researchers - Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru - watch him in confusion. They have been working on a project involving a time machine, a repurposed microwave they call the "PhoneWave," and messages to the past, known as "D-mails". Okabe, the ringleader, discovers that their crucial piece of equipment, a vintage computer called the IBN 5100, has vanished. His fear and desperation is palpable as he accuses various parties, including a research organization named SERN, of possibly stealing it. The tension in the room is thick as Okabe tries to convince his team, who are grappling with the sudden chaos, that the disappearance of the computer is a serious crisis. The primary mission for everyone in this fraught scene is to figure out what happened to the missing IBN 5100.
