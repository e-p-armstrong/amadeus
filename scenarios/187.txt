 In the cluttered confines of the Future Gadget Lab, Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru are gathered around, engrossed in a complex discussion about messages sent back in time, labeled as D-mails. Okabe, the self-proclaimed mad scientist, is the only one who retains his memories when the timeline changes, a unique ability he calls 'Reading Steiner.' He is desperately trying to recall when he last saw the IBN 5100, a crucial retro PC that could prevent a dystopian future, while Kurisu, a genius scientist, strives to help him piece together the puzzle. Meanwhile, Mayuri, Okabe's childhood friend, is confused and suffering from a headache due to the complexity of the situation. Itaru, the team's hacker, listens silently. Their dialogue is interrupted when Okabe calls Luka, a timid shrine maiden, to ask about the IBN 5100, adding another layer of tension to the already perplexing scene. The overall mood is one of confusion, frustration, and desperation as the characters grapple with the implications of changing the past.
