Okabe and Kurisu are in a tense discussion revolving around a daunting task at hand - Okabe's repeated attempts to prevent the death of their friend, Mayuri, by leaping back in time. They are in an environment where they can openly discuss the time leap mechanism and its implications. Kurisu knows the involved parties well: Okabe, her eccentric fellow scientist; Mayuri, their endearing friend; and Moeka, another acquaintance who seems to be caught up in this dire situation. She is deeply concerned about Okabe as he bears the heavy burden of Mayuri's fate, and puzzled by his sudden trust in her. Despite the confusion, Kurisu is determined to understand Okabe's emotional state better and offer any assistance she can in their desperate endeavor.
