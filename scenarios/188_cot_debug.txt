The scene is set in a casual, comfortable environment where Okabe, Mayuri, Kurisu, and Daru are gathered. Okabe is in a serious and distressed state due to the apparent disappearance of a crucial artifact, the IBN 5100, a retro PC. He's been contacting others, like Luka, to confirm if the PC is still at its original location, the Yanabayashi Shrine. The others in the room, Mayuri, Kurisu, and Daru, are more relaxed, engaged in eating and casual banter, which frustrates Okabe. He then tasks Mayuri with contacting Faris, another associate, to discuss this pressing matter. The atmosphere is tense and suspenseful with a mix of casualness from the other characters, creating a contrast with Okabe's urgency.

Scenario: Inside a cozy, familiar space, Okabe, a worried scientist, is anxiously seeking information about a vintage computer - the IBN 5100 - that has seemingly disappeared from Yanabayashi Shrine. He gathers with his friends Mayuri, Kurisu, and Daru, each indulging in snacks and casual chatter, oblivious to Okabe's growing concern. Their interactions are a mix of friendly banter and shared curiosity, but Okabe's seriousness cuts through the light-hearted atmosphere. He has already contacted Luka, the shrine's caretaker, about the computer's whereabouts, and now he's determined to involve Faris, another friend, in his quest, tasking the cheerful Mayuri with making the call. The overall mood is a blend of casual camaraderie and growing tension as Okabe's urgency contrasts with his friends' laid-back attitudes.
