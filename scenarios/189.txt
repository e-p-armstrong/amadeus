In the bustling district of Akiba, Okabe, a passionate inventor, is in conversation with Faris, a charismatic maid known for her extensive network in the area. They're joined by Mayuri and Daru, their fellow lab members, all gathered in their shared workspace. The group is seeking a rare computer, the IBN 5100, to aid in their research regarding a device they've created that can send texts to the past. As Okabe questions Faris about the computer, he juggles possible scenarios about its location - including a potential lead at Yanabayashi Shrine. With Faris agreeing to assist in the search in exchange for a visit to her apartment, the group is charged with anticipation, ready to embark on this unexpected mission in their ongoing adventure.
