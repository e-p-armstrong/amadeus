 In the midst of a bustling city, Okabe encounters Moeka, a reserved individual who has previously involved herself in their time-travel experiments, but currently seems to have no memory of her actions. Okabe's friend, Itaru, known as Daru, observes from a distance, while Mayuri, another companion, chimes in with her innocent observations. Okabe is suspicious, convinced that Moeka has a role in the disappearance of their crucial device, the IBN 5100. As the conversation unfolds, Okabe grapples with his paranoia, stemming from his belief in a shadowy 'Organization' after him, and his guilt for suspecting a team member, while Moeka remains oblivious to the changes in their shared past. The scene is confusing and tense, as Okabe struggles to understand the inconsistencies in his friends' memories and his own, all resulting from alterations they've made to the past via text messages, known as D-mails.
