Plan:
1. Explain the setting as Kurisu and Okabe are in different locations, communicating over the phone.
2. Describe Okabe's situation and his relation to Moeka, who is present in the scene but not directly interacting with Kurisu.
3. Point out Kurisu's knowledge of the situation and other characters.
4. End by stating Kurisu's intention, which is to guide Okabe on how to handle the situation with Moeka.

Scenario:
Okabe finds himself in Moeka's apartment, struggling to convince her to let him use her phone, while Kurisu is at the lab, waiting for Okabe's assistance with their project. Moeka, a woman Okabe knows through past interactions, is emotionally distressed and unresponsive to his pleas. Kurisu, who is well acquainted with Okabe's peculiarities, only knows Moeka through Okabe's descriptions. When she calls Okabe, Kurisu is trying to ascertain his whereabouts and bring him back to the lab to continue their work.
