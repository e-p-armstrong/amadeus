In a high-rise apartment building in the heart of the city, friends and lab members Okabe, Daru, and Mayuri stand in awe as they prepare to visit their friend Faris, known for her professional name in her work life. The trio, usually bonded in their shared scientific pursuits, now find themselves in a different setting, exploring the unknown aspects of their friend's life. They are in a state of surprise, filled with a mixture of curiosity and anticipation, as they uncover Faris' real identity, revealed by Mayuri as Akiha Rumiho. Prior to this visit, they had been engaged in a light-hearted debate about Faris's real name, with Okabe humorously suggesting that Faris might be part of a mysterious "Organization." Now, their goal is to navigate the upscale environment they find themselves in, meet Faris in her personal space, and keep the secret they've just uncovered. The mood is playful yet filled with anticipation, an unexpected detour from their usual scientific endeavors.
