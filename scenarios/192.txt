In a luxury apartment in the heart of Akiba's best district, Okabe, Mayuri, and Daru find themselves in the home of their friend, Faris. Their relationships are lighthearted and friendly, with a touch of underlying tension as Okabe pushes Faris for answers about her opulent lifestyle. Up until now, the group has been engaging in playful banter, but Okabe's persistent questioning has begun to uncover a side of Faris they did not know. Okabe, driven by curiosity, aims to discover the truth behind Faris's wealth, while Mayuri and Daru are there mainly to support their friend. Faris, on the other hand, attempts to maintain her playful demeanor while keeping her true identity a secret. The overall mood of the scene is light and casual, with a dash of mystery due to Faris's evasiveness.
