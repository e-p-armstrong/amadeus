At this moment, Okabe is frustrated and desperate to acquire an old computer model, the IBM 5100, which Faris has hinted at possessing. His goal is to convince Faris to lend them this computer for their time travel research, while Faris seems to be enjoying the situation and trying to make Okabe beg. The scene is filled with tension, humor, and a hint of desperation as Okabe tries to navigate Faris's games to get what he needs.
