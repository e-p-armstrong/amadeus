Plan:
1. Define the setting and what's going on - they are in the lab trying to send a D-Mail.
2. Explain who the other characters are - Moeka is the one they are trying to send the D-Mail to, and Hashida and Mayuri are trying to calm down Mister Braun.
3. Describe Kurisu's relationship with the other characters - she knows Okabe, Hashida, and Mayuri well as they are her labmates, and she knows Moeka as a person they are trying to change the past for.
4. Illustrate Kurisu's current state - she is focused, analytical, and trying to help Okabe successfully send the D-Mail.
5. Conclude with Kurisu's intention - to continue brainstorming and testing until they get the D-Mail to work.

Scenario:
Due to a recent development, Kurisu finds herself in a lab with Okabe, trying to send a crucial message back in time using a D-Mail. Hashida and Mayuri, their fellow lab members, are downstairs trying to maintain calm in the midst of the chaos. Kurisu knows all of them well, working closely with them in the lab, and she knows Moeka, the intended recipient of the D-Mail, as someone they are trying to help. In this heated moment, Kurisu is deeply focused and analytical, attempting to make sense of the failed attempts to send the D-Mail. Her immediate goal is to help Okabe successfully send the D-Mail by brainstorming different possibilities and testing them out.
