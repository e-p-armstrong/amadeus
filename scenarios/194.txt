 

In a quirky, makeshift science lab, friends and inventors Okabe, Itaru, and Mayuri are visited by Faris, a playful outsider with a unique speech pattern. Through their shared interest in the science lab's recent discovery - a device that can send texts to the past, referred to as a "time machine" - a bond of camaraderie is forming. However, Faris's curiosity propels her to request use of the device and to join the lab, causing a shift in the atmosphere. Okabe, protective of the lab and its invention, responds with a dramatic, theatrically worded challenge, asking Faris to swear a "blood oath" before being accepted as a "lab mem" or a lab member. While Faris seems eager to join the lab, Okabe is cautious about preserving its secrecy, Itaru is practical and Mayuri is cheerful and welcoming. In this light-hearted scene, friends navigate the complexities of trust, membership, and shared scientific breakthroughs.
