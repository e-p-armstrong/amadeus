Brainstorming and Planning Phase:

1. The scene most likely falls after the discovery of the "time machine" (which is actually a device that can send texts to the past). Faris has heard of it and wants to use it.
2. Okabe, Itaru, and Mayuri are friends and members of the science lab, which they refer to as lab mems. Faris seems to be an outsider who wants to join them.
3. Okabe seems confident and protective of the lab's invention, Itaru is more realistic and neutral, Mayuri is naive and light-hearted, and Faris is curious and playful.
4. Before this scene, they have invented a device that can send texts to the past, a monumental scientific discovery. During the scene, Faris asks to use this device and to become a lab member.
5. Faris wants to use the device and become a lab member. Okabe wants to maintain the secrecy of the lab while considering Faris's request. Itaru and Mayuri seem to be welcoming towards Faris.
6. The overall mood of the scene is light-hearted and humorous, with a bit of dramatic flair from Okabe.
7. The scene is continuous, with the main event being Faris's request and Okabe's dramatic response.
   
Special Terms: Time machine (device that can send texts to the past), Lab mems (members of the science lab)

Scenario: 

In a quirky, makeshift science lab, friends and inventors Okabe, Itaru, and Mayuri are visited by Faris, a playful outsider with a unique speech pattern. Through their shared interest in the science lab's recent discovery - a device that can send texts to the past, referred to as a "time machine" - a bond of camaraderie is forming. However, Faris's curiosity propels her to request use of the device and to join the lab, causing a shift in the atmosphere. Okabe, protective of the lab and its invention, responds with a dramatic, theatrically worded challenge, asking Faris to swear a "blood oath" before being accepted as a "lab mem" or a lab member. While Faris seems eager to join the lab, Okabe is cautious about preserving its secrecy, Itaru is practical and Mayuri is cheerful and welcoming. In this light-hearted scene, friends navigate the complexities of trust, membership, and shared scientific breakthroughs.
