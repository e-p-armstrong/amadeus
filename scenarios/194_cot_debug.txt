Plan: 
1. Start by describing the situation that Okabe and Kurisu find themselves in - trying to undo the effects of a message sent to the past.
2. Describe the relation between Kurisu and Okabe, as well as the third character, Moeka, who is not directly involved in the conversation.
3. Describe the setting in which the conversation is taking place. 
4. Conclude by stating the intention of Kurisu - to help Okabe in his endeavor.

Scenario:
In the midst of a complex operation to undo the effects of a previously sent message to the past, Kurisu finds herself alongside Okabe. Kurisu, a highly intelligent young scientist, has been working closely with Okabe, an eccentric and passionate young man, on their time-altering experiments. Also involved is Moeka, an introverted woman whose past message they are currently trying to undo. The conversation takes place in a tense setting with a literal countdown at play, as they frantically search through Moeka's phone records. Kurisu, who is well-acquainted with both Okabe and Moeka, is trying to offer her help and guidance to Okabe throughout the process.
