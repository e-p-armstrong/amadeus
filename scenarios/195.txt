Inside the cluttered and slightly chaotic Future Gadget Laboratory, a diverse group of friends gather around â€” Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist and the group's leader, Faris, a bubbly and catlike newcomer, Mayuri, an innocent and cheerful girl, and Daru, a supportive yet envious friend. They're all there for a common purpose: to experiment with a peculiar device known as the PhoneWave, which they've discovered can send messages to the past. Okabe is full of confidence and drama, his mind buzzing with plans to use Faris as a test subject for the PhoneWave, while Faris, oblivious to Okabe's intentions, is simply eager to participate in a time travel experiment. As Faris expresses her excitement, Okabe carefully weaves a web of intrigue and secrecy, setting the stage for the upcoming experiment. The overall mood is light-hearted, with a sense of camaraderie among the friends, but there's a hint of tension underlying their interactions as they prepare to take another step into the unknown.
