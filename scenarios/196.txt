 In a cluttered lab filled with machines and electronic gadgets, a group of friends - Okabe, Mayuri, Itaru, and Faris - are gathered around a peculiar device they've named the PhoneWave, a machine they've discovered can send messages to the past. Okabe, the group's eccentric leader, is orchestrating an experiment using the PhoneWave, with the help of Kurisu, a fellow scientist who is assisting from a separate location via phone. The air is filled with a mix of excitement and tension as they prepare for the experiment, with Faris, usually confident, showing uncharacteristic shyness about the content of her message to the past. The group's dynamic is a blend of camaraderie and conflict, especially when Faris resists Okabe's demand to know the content of her message for the sake of scientific transparency. As they gear up for the experiment, each character is driven by their own goal: Okabe's pursuit of scientific success, Mayuri and Itaru's support for their friend, Faris's desire for privacy, and Kurisu's commitment to assist despite Okabe's antics. The mood is a lighthearted yet tense anticipation as they balance their interpersonal dynamics with the thrill of their scientific endeavor.
