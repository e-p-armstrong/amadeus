 Okabe finds himself in Faris's room, together with Mayuri and Itaru, while Kurisu's voice nags him through the phone about their ongoing experiment with the PhoneWave, a device capable of sending messages to the past. As Okabe grapples with the pressure from his friends, the playful Faris seems to be enjoying her upper hand in this situation, while the usually soft-spoken Mayuri surprisingly sides with her. In the midst of this tense situation, the three friends - Mayuri, Itaru, and Faris - are also engrossed in a card game, adding an element of casual fun to the otherwise serious setting. Okabe, feeling cornered, decides to proceed with the experiment, under the watchful gaze of his friends. The atmosphere is a mix of tension and playfulness, with the characters balancing their scientific pursuits with their personal dynamics.
