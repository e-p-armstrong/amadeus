Scenario:
Okabe and Moeka, a woman who was once their adversary but is now cooperating with them, are investigating the identity of an enigmatic figure known as FB, who they suspect is tied to several inexplicable occurrences. They have been staking out a house and tracking leads, which brings them back to their local area. Kurisu, who is well-acquainted with Okabe and harbors mixed feelings towards his eccentricity, is also familiar with Moeka, though their relationship is strained due to past conflicts. She has a close, sister-like bond with another girl, Mayuri, who is not present but is deeply affected by the ongoing events. Concerned about Okabe's secretive actions and the toll they're taking on Mayuri, Kurisu confronts Okabe, aiming to better understand the situation and ensure Mayuri's safety by insisting on joining Okabe's investigation.
