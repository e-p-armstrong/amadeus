Scenario:
In the heart of the bustling tech district of Akiba, four friends — Okabe, Itaru, Mayuri, and Faris — are in the midst of a light-hearted exchange upon leaving Faris's apartment. They've just met with Faris's father, a CEO, not as intimidating as they had imagined him to be. Okabe, the philosophical one, muses over the city's populace, while Itaru, the playful techie, jests about a gaming match with Faris, who playfully denies his claims with her cute cat-like persona. Meanwhile, Mayuri, the whimsical one, quietly wanders off toward the station without alerting the others. As they notice her missing, they are thrown into brief confusion before they spot her and she casually mentions her plan to visit Nakano Broadway. Each of the friends aims to navigate the bustling city and return to their lab, while dealing with the minor hiccup of Mayuri's sudden disappearance. The overall mood of the scene is light-hearted and casual, a slice-of-life moment amidst their usual scientific explorations.
