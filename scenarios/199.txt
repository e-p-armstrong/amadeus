 Okabe Rintaro, Itaru "Daru" Hashida, and Mayuri Shiina find themselves in the Akihabara district, filled with unfamiliar sights. Okabe's memories of Akihabara as the center for otaku culture clash with the reality of a landscape dominated by electronic stores, a scenario his friends, Daru and Mayuri, are oblivious to. As they casually discuss their favorite doujinshi, independently published manga, Okabe grows increasingly distressed, struggling to reconcile his memories with the changed reality. Unaware of Okabe's confusion, Daru and Mayuri simply seek to continue their light-hearted conversation. The tension between the playful banter and the bewildering changes in the environment create a perplexing and unsettling atmosphere.
