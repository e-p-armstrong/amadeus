 
In the bustling town of Akiba, once a hotspot for cutesy anime culture, Okabe, Mayuri, and Daru find themselves amidst electronics stores, a stark contrast to the endearing, youthful, and innocent charm it once boasted. Okabe, the only one aware of the town's transformation due to a message sent to the past, grapples with the reality of the changed landscape, while his friends, Mayuri and Daru seem nonplussed, their memories shaped by the new timeline. Okabe, burdened by the guilt of altering history, is trying to decipher the contents of the past-altering message, while Mayuri and Daru continue their lives, blissfully ignorant of the changes. The once vibrant town is now overrun by electronics enthusiasts, its former charm replaced by the hum of machinery and the fervor of tech aficionados. The atmosphere is thick with confusion and a sense of loss, as Okabe navigates this new, unfamiliar reality.
