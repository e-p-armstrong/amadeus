Inside a lab, Okabe, a self-proclaimed 'mad scientist', returns to find his childhood friend Mayuri, and their mutual friends Kurisu and Luka, already present. Okabe, hiding his recent anxiety from a prank email, greets them, attempting to maintain an air of normality. Mayuri and Luka, both high school students, are engrossed in a photo album of cosplayersâ€”people who dress up as specific characters, often from comics or 'doujinshi', a type of self-published work. Kurisu, a brilliant yet aloof scientist, dismisses the album, absorbed in her own English book. The atmosphere is casual and relaxed, despite Okabe's internal tension, with the friends engaging in their respective interests.
