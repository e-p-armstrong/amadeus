 

Inside a comfortable, lived-in space, four friends - Okabe, Kurisu, Luka, and Mayuri - are in the middle of a friendly debate about a proposed group activity. Okabe and Kurisu, both scientists who have formed an unlikely bond through shared experiences in time-traveling research, are known for their playful banter. Mayuri, Okabe's childhood friend, and Luka, a gentle individual who the group cares for deeply, are also present. The conversation takes a sharp turn from playful to tense when Okabe, known for his eccentricity, makes an insensitive remark about Luka's gender identity, a topic that had been altered in the past using their time-travel technology. As the scene unfolds, Okabe finds himself trying to defend his viewpoint against the disapproval of his friends, while Kurisu, Mayuri, and Luka seek an apology from Okabe for his insensitive words. The overall mood of the scene is tense, showcasing a stark contrast between their initial lighthearted banter and the ensuing conflict.
