Plan:
1. Start by explaining the situation - Moeka's death. Briefly mention who Moeka is.
2. Describe the location of the event - Okabe and Kurisu are at the lab.
3. Mention that Kurisu knows Okabe and Moeka well, and her feelings towards them.
4. End by stating what Kurisu is trying to do - have Okabe send the D-Mail.

Scenario:
In the aftermath of Moeka's tragic demise, a woman who once stood as an adversary, Kurisu finds herself alongside Okabe in the confines of their laboratory - a place filled with shared memories and discoveries. Kurisu, a bright and compassionate scientist, knows Okabe well and shares a bond of friendship, while her relation with Moeka is a complex mixture of sympathy and conflict due to past events. Amidst the palpable tension and sorrow, Kurisu attempts to refocus Okabe's attention towards their mission - altering the course of events by utilizing the D-Mail, their tool for sending messages to the past.
