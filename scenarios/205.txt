In the sweltering heat of a summer day, Okabe and Suzuha, two members of a team of inventors, find themselves outside in the city. Suzuha, usually the more energetic of the pair, today seems subdued, her zest muted. Okabe, uncomfortable in the heat and unaccustomed to physical exertion, is trying to keep pace with Suzuha's proposed activity: cycling. As they navigate the streets, they share small talk, and Suzuha reveals a personal quest: she is in search of her father in this city. Okabe, caught off guard by the revelation, tries to offer light-hearted responses, masking his surprise and concern. The scene is a blend of light-hearted banter and underlying somberness, as the usually vibrant Suzuha opens up about her personal challenges.
