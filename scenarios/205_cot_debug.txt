Plan:
1. Describe the immediate setting where Okabe and Kurisu are, without mentioning the events prior to the scene.
2. Introduce Nae and her relation to Okabe and Kurisu without going into detail about her backstory.
3. Describe Kurisu's state of mind and her concern for Okabe.
4. Conclude with Kurisu's intention, which is to help Okabe and understand what has happened.

Scenario:
Okabe and Kurisu find themselves in a tense situation, following a confrontation between Okabe and a young girl named Nae. Nae, a distant acquaintance of both Okabe and Kurisu, has been involved in a violent conflict with Okabe, leaving him injured. Kurisu, a close friend and collaborator of Okabe, rushes to his side upon seeing his injured state. Visibly worried and confused about the situation, she is desperate to understand what has transpired between Okabe and Nae. With her primary objective being to assist Okabe and ensure his safety, Kurisu tries to calm him down and discuss the situation further.
