In the cluttered, gadget-stuffed laboratory of self-proclaimed mad scientist Okabe Rintaro, he shares a tense conversation with Suzuha, a part-time worker from a nearby electronics store and a friend. Their relationship is one of trust and friendship, with an underlying layer of mystery surrounding Suzuha's past. Suzuha is visibly worried and desperate as she reveals her mission to find her missing father, a task that has brought her to an unfamiliar town and left her feeling alone. Prior to this, the two friends had discovered a messaging system, known as "D-Mail", which allows them to send messages to the past. Okabe, in his usual eccentric mood, proposes to use this D-Mail to help Suzuha. However, her inability to provide her father's contact information brings an air of disappointment and defeat to the scene. Suzuha's goal is to find her father and she hopes that talking to Okabe might help her, while Okabe's goal is to assist her using their newfound technology. The overall mood of the scene is a blend of seriousness and light-heartedness, a balance between Suzuha's desperation and Okabe's eccentric optimism.
