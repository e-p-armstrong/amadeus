 In the cluttered and lively lab, Okabe, the self-proclaimed mad scientist, finds himself in a discussion about time travel with Suzuha, a part-time worker with a keen interest in their work. Joining them are Mayuri, Okabe's optimistic childhood friend, Kurisu, a genius scientist with a deep sense of caution, and Luka, a shy and soft-spoken newcomer. The lab members share a unique bond, strengthened by their shared experiences and the knowledge of their groundbreaking invention -- a primitive time machine capable of sending messages to the past. As Suzuha asks about plans for upgrading the machine, Okabe reveals they are working on it, but hints at his lack of solid ideas. Further, Okabe proposes a plan for a party which is met with mixed reactions from his team: Mayuri is eager to help, Kurisu is skeptical and warns him against any rash actions, and Luka is unsure due to his unfamiliarity with Suzuha. Despite the skepticism, Okabe is adamant about his plan, showcasing his playful confidence. The atmosphere is a mix of excitement, hope, and a hint of suspense as they navigate their way through the intricate world of time travel.
