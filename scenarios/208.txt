Kurisu, a young genius scientist, is in an informal meeting with Okabe, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist", and Itaru, their tech-savvy friend. They are trying to discuss and find a solution to a problem they caused - their experiments with time travel have had unintended and disastrous consequences. Kurisu is well-acquainted with both Okabe and Itaru; they have been working together for quite some time on these experiments. As Okabe lays out a plan that involves manipulating the timeline they have altered, Kurisu, intrigued and skeptical, is trying to understand it fully to decide whether it could be a viable solution to their problem.
