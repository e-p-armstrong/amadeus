Brainstorming: 

The conversation takes place between Okabe, Kurisu, and Daru. They are likely in a public place, possibly a shopping district. The conversation seems to be focused on their relationships and future plans. Kurisu and Okabe are discussing their friendship and trust, which seems to be a significant factor in the plot as Okabe mentions his struggle with trust. It may be after they have started their work on time travel based on Okabe's inner monologue mentioning his enemies and his genius. Daru is also present, and the conversation shifts towards planning a party for Suzuha. It seems like they are trying to balance their personal lives with their scientific endeavors.

In the Steins;Gate universe, D-Mail refers to messages sent to the past. The Last Supper and Operation Eldhrimnir that Okabe mentions are likely code names for their plans regarding Suzuha and their time-travel experiments.

Okabe's goal is to protect his friends and continue his experiments, while Kurisu wants to express her friendship towards Okabe. Daru seems to be caught in a conflict between attending an offline meet or a party with his friends.

The overall mood of the scene is tense yet humorous, with a mix of serious discussions about trust and friendship, alongside lighthearted banter about parties and food.

The scene is a blend of seriousness and lightheartedness as they balance their scientific endeavors with their personal relationships.
