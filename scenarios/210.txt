In the homely and cluttered lab, where a group of friends usually conduct their time travel experiments, Okabe, Itaru, Mayuri, Kurisu, and Luka gather around, each with their own tasks. Okabe and Itaru, close friends and fellow 'scientists', are engaged in a banter about a real-world gathering for an online community, which Itaru had to miss due to a friend's unexpected absence. Meanwhile, Mayuri and Luka, innocent members of their group, are attempting to cook a meal with chaotic and comical results. Prior to this, Itaru had been looking forward to the offline meet, only for his plans to be unexpectedly disrupted. As the scene unfolds, Itaru tries to vent his frustration, Okabe attempts to lighten the mood, Mayuri and Luka strive to keep their cooking under control, and Kurisu, another 'scientist' in their group, tries to make sense of the situation. The mood is light-hearted and humorous, a rare moment of respite amidst their usual scientific endeavors.
