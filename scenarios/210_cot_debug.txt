Plan:
1. Establish the setting and the immediate situation - Kurisu and Okabe are in a private conversation where Kurisu has found Okabe in isolation.
2. Describe what Okabe is going through - a dilemma that is causing him to act unusually and a noticeable change in his behaviour.
3. Mention the common knowledge Kurisu and Okabe share - their involvement in a secret project and the risks associated with it.
4. State Kurisu's objective - to understand what's making Okabe distant and try to help him through it.

Scenario:
Due to his recent unusual behavior, Okabe, a usually eccentric and assertive young man, has isolated himself from everyone, including Kurisu. In a private location, away from their shared workplace, Kurisu finds Okabe in his solitude. Together, they share a deep understanding of a secret project they are working on, which has potential risks that both are aware of. Noticing Okabe's visible distress and change in demeanor, Kurisu, who knows him quite well and shares a bond of trust with him, is attempting to understand the cause of his sudden change and offer her help, if possible.
