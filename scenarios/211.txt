Following a deep dive into the waters of time-travel theories, Kurisu finds herself in a heated discussion with Okabe. They are joined by their fellow lab members, Hashida, who is often referred to as Daru, and Mayuri, both of whom Kurisu knows well and works alongside regularly. As the argument unfolds, Kurisu begins to question the accepted model of time-travel, challenging Okabe's steadfast belief in it. Intent on proposing her own hypothesis and potentially reshaping their understanding of time, Kurisu delves into her specialized field of neuroscience, hoping to convince Okabe to consider her perspective.
