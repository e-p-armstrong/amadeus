Scenario:
In the confines of their laboratory, a group of friends-turned-scientists - Okabe, Kurisu, Luka, Itaru, and Mayuri - find themselves in the midst of a tense situation. Okabe, the group's eccentric leader, is behaving oddly, his laughter unnerving his companions. Sensing Okabe's distress, Kurisu, his closest associate, tries to rationalize his actions, while Luka, Itaru, and Mayuri express their concern and confusion. The tension centers around their experimental device, dubbed the "PhoneWave", a prototype time machine capable of sending messages, or "D-Mails", to the past. Okabe, desperate to alter their current circumstances, intends to send a D-Mail to his past self, effectively changing the course of events. As they grapple with the weight of their actions and the uncertainties of tampering with time, the atmosphere in the lab is filled with suspense and apprehension.
