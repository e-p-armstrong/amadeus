Plan:
1. Establish the situation that leads to the conversation between Kurisu and Okabe - a seemingly private moment between them.
2. Describe the setting in which the conversation takes place, without mentioning any specifics from the Steins;Gate plot.
3. Outline the relationship between Kurisu and the other characters in the scene - Okabe and Mayuri.
4. Conclude with Kurisu's intention in the conversation.

Scenario:
After a series of intense events, Kurisu and Okabe find themselves alone, seeking a moment of respite. They are in a quiet location, away from the usual hustle and bustle. Kurisu knows Okabe quite well, having worked closely with him on various occasions. Mayuri, whose call interrupts their conversation, is a mutual friend but Kurisu doesn't know her as intimately as Okabe. In this moment, Kurisu is trying to reassure Okabe that he doesn't need to worry about her, while navigating the interruption from Mayuri's call.
