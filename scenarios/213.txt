 Okabe and Suzuha, two friends with a shared interest in scientific experiments, are sitting in Okabe's laboratory, discussing the events of a recent gathering they attended with others. The two share a friendly camaraderie, with Okabe's eccentric enthusiasm balancing against Suzuha's more subdued, sincere demeanor. This conversation follows an evening of socializing and bonding, during which Okabe, a self-proclaimed scientist, has been attempting to recruit Suzuha to participate in experiments involving a device he calls the "PhoneWave." Suzuha, in turn, is considering Okabe's offer while holding onto the hope that she might find her missing father, known only by the codename "Titor". The scene is upbeat and hopeful, even as the underlying concern for Suzuha's father adds a note of melancholy.
