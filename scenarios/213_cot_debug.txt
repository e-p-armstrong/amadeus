Plan:
1. First, I will describe the situation at hand - Okabe is having a phone conversation with Mayuri, who is feeling like a burden to him, and by extension, to the group. 
2. I will then explain that Kurisu is present at that moment and overhears the conversation.
3. I will mention the relationship between Kurisu and the other characters - Okabe is a colleague and friend, while Mayuri is a mutual friend whose wellbeing they both care about.
4. I will then state that Kurisu is trying to convince Okabe to be honest with Mayuri about his feelings towards her.

Scenario:
In the middle of a tense phone conversation with their mutual friend Mayuri, Okabe is left feeling troubled and frustrated. Kurisu, a fellow scientist and confidant, is present during this interaction and catches the tail end of the distressing conversation. Kurisu knows Mayuri through Okabe, and cares about her wellbeing. Seeing Okabe's distress, Kurisu tries to encourage him to be more open with Mayuri about his feelings and reassure her that she's not a burden to them.
