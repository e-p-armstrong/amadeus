 In a lab filled with an array of electronic devices, Suzuha and Okabe are engrossed in front of a screen, trying to uncover the mystery of Suzuha's missing father. Okabe, a persistent friend and fellow scientist, is eager to solve the puzzle, while Suzuha, a time-traveler and lab member, maintains an air of calm disinterest. They are connected by their common goal, yet their understanding of the situation seems to diverge. Okabe has found a lead on a forum, a user named Titor he believes might be Suzuha's father, which Suzuha dismisses with certainty, suggesting she knows more about the mystery than she's revealed. The scene's mood is one of mystery and anticipation, as Okabe seeks the truth, while Suzuha grapples with her hidden knowledge.
