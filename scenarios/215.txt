 
Caught off guard by a sudden downpour, Kurisu and Okabe find themselves trapped in a dimly lit, closed building. In response to Okabe's playful and eccentric behavior, Kurisu finds herself flustered and defensive, showing their familiar and somewhat argumentative relationship. Kurisu knows Okabe well, understanding his eccentricities and finding his antics both irritating and endearing. As the rain continues to pour outside, Kurisu aims to pass the time by engaging in their usual banter and tolerating Okabe's teasing.
