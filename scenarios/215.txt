 The scene is set in a college laboratory, a place of scientific trials and experiments, where Okabe, a grave and intense young man, has been sleeping on a sofa, plagued by nightmares. He shares this space with his friend Mayuri, a carefree girl who is presently absorbed in a television program. Their relationship is one of protective affection, with Okabe feeling a strong need to keep Mayuri safe. Okabe's mental state, filled with anxiety and paranoia, is a result of threatening emails he's been receiving, and his recent involvement in activities that seemingly altered the past. In this scene, Okabe, waking from a particularly unsettling dream, reassures himself that Mayuri is safe and sound, while also waiting for a response to a significant email he sent, pertaining to his past-altering endeavors. Then, they receive a call from Faris, a quirky, catgirl persona-loving friend. Okabe's goal in this scene is to reassure himself of Mayuri's safety, to make sense of his nightmares and to deal with Faris' call, while Mayuri, oblivious to his internal turmoil, simply enjoys her TV program. The overall mood of the scene is tense, with Okabe's anxiety casting a shadow over the otherwise mundane reality.
