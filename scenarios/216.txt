 In a makeshift lab cluttered with eccentric inventions, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is engaged in a conversation with Faris, a playful friend who often speaks in cat-themed language. They are discussing the search for a rare retro computer called an IBN 5100, which they believe is critical for their time travel experiments. Faris, though keeping up her playful demeanor, warns Okabe about the emergence of multiple threats, referring to them with cryptic code names. Mayuri, Okabe's cheerful childhood friend, is also present, serving as a supportive and upbeat presence amidst the growing tension. As Okabe grapples with the urgency to locate the IBN 5100 and the looming threats, the atmosphere in the lab remains tense and fraught with anticipation.
