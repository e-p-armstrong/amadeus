Plan:
1. Start by describing the setting: a dark, seemingly abandoned venue where Kurisu and Okabe are present.
2. Introduce the relationship between Kurisu and Okabe and how they know each other.
3. Describe Kurisu's state of mind and her current activity (sewing Okabe's coat).
4. Conclude with what Kurisu is trying to do: have a conversation with Okabe about his decision regarding an unspecified matter.

Scenario:
In a dark, seemingly abandoned place, genius scientist Kurisu finds herself alone with Okabe, a fellow scientist and friend who she's come to know well through their shared work in inventing. They've been through many experiences together, each one deepening their understanding of the other. In the gloom, Kurisu occupies herself with mending a tear in Okabe's coat, a task that seems oddly domestic in the otherwise strange setting. As she sews, she struggles to initiate a conversation with Okabe about a decision she knows he's been wrestling with, hoping to provide some sort of comfort or guidance.
