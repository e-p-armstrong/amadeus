In their makeshift lab, friends and amateur scientists Okabe and Itaru, accompanied by their cheerful friend Mayuri, are deep in a tense discussion. Okabe and Itaru, bound by shared curiosity and pursuit of knowledge, have discovered a mysterious direct connection to SERN, a powerful organization they believe to be involved in time travel. The mood is thick with excitement and fear; Okabe's paranoia grows as he suspects SERN has been watching their actions, while Itaru's focus is on the remarkable technical possibilities their discovery presents. Previously, the trio had been experimenting with sending messages to the past; now, they grapple with the reality that their actions might have attracted the attention of SERN. As they try to decipher the implications of their discovery and plan their next steps, Kurisu, a recent addition to their team, enters the room with a grave expression, adding another layer of tension to the already charged atmosphere.
