 In their makeshift lab nestled in Tokyo's Akihabara district, a group of friends turned amateur scientists gather around a peculiar invention they've named the PhoneWave, a modified microwave that has shown time-travel capabilities. The group consists of the eccentric Okabe, the hacker Daru, the naive Mayuri, and the newly joined genius, Kurisu. As Okabe and Daru eagerly lean in, Kurisu, her arms clutching herself in an attempt to suppress her trembling, begins to explain her hypothesis about the workings of their invention. Drawing parallels to the world's largest particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, she warns them of the potential danger they've unwittingly created. The room fills with a tense anticipation as she dives into the technical details, Okabe and Daru trying to follow her explanation, and Mayuri doing her best to keep up with the unfamiliar scientific jargon.
