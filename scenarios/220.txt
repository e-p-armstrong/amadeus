In a cluttered lab, Okabe, the self-proclaimed mad scientist, is deep in discussion with his fellow researchers: the talented scientist Kurisu, the tech-savvy Itaru, and the innocent Mayuri. Together, they form a tight-knit group of friends working on a groundbreaking discovery: a time-traveling device they've named the PhoneWave. Prior to this scene, they've found out that the PhoneWave can send text messages to the past, which they call D-mails. As they try to unravel the mysteries behind their invention, they're drawn into a highly technical discussion about the similarities between their PhoneWave and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator that generates mini black holes. The goal of Okabe and the team in this scene is to understand the workings of their device and how it might beat SERN, a powerful and secretive organization, in achieving physical time travel. The overall mood is intense, as the room fills with complex theories and heated debates.
