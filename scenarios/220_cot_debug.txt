Plan:
1. Start by describing the setting, which is an intimate moment between Okabe and Kurisu.
2. Describe Kurisu's relationship to Okabe, which is deeply emotional.
3. Mention Kurisu's emotional state and what she wants - to ensure Okabe will remember her.
4. Do not mention anything that occurs after Kurisu's first few lines.

Scenario:
In a private and emotionally charged setting, Kurisu finds herself alone with Okabe, a man she's developed deep feelings for. Okabe, a fellow science enthusiast who has shared numerous significant experiences with Kurisu, is equally drawn to her. As they navigate their feelings, Kurisu, normally composed, is flustered and anxious. Desperate to leave a lasting impression on Okabe, she gathers the courage to ask him a question that directly addresses their relationship, hoping for reassurance that he will remember her.
