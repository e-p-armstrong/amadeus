 Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru are in their lab, a place of experimentation and discovery, engrossed in a heated discussion about their ongoing time travel research. Okabe, the driving force of the group, is bursting with ideas and desperation, while Kurisu, a genius, is a grounding presence and a source of practical knowledge. Itaru, the tech-savvy member, is trying to keep up with the intellectual debate. They've discovered the ability to send messages to the past, called "D-mails", but are limited to 36 bytes of data; any more results in a "Jellyman" - a person turned into a jelly-like substance. Driven by the desire to push their experiments further, Okabe proposes a radical idea: convert a human to data, compress it, and send it through time, an idea that Kurisu finds unexpectedly plausible. The atmosphere is charged with tension, excitement, and a touch of desperation as they grapple with the possibilities.
