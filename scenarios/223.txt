Their rapport is a blend of curiosity and camaraderie, with Okabe and Kurisu more serious while Itaru lightens the situation with humor.

Kurisu explains the intricacies of this method, likening it to transferring data between computers, with cellphones being the medium for this transfer. The overall mood is a blend of intellectual seriousness and lighthearted humor, as they pioneer their way through uncharted scientific territory.
