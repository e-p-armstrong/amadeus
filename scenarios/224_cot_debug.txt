This scene likely takes place after Kurisu has joined Okabe's lab and the characters are in the process of creating their time-leap machine. The conversation suggests that Okabe and Kurisu are now in a place where they can talk about their plans and concerns freely. The dialogue also indicates Kurisu's inner struggles and insecurities, which Okabe tries to address. 

"Operation Verthandi" would be a codename for their current project, presumably the construction of the time-leap machine. "El Psy Kongroo" is Okabe's signature catchphrase, usually used to conclude his self-styled mad scientist rants and declarations. 

In writing the scenario, I would need to set up the location (the lab), the presence and relationship of the characters (Okabe and Kurisu, with Mayuri and Daru exiting the scene), and the task at hand (building the time-leap machine). I would also note the emotional state of the characters, with Okabe being confident and authoritative, and Kurisu being deep in thought and somewhat insecure. 

Their goals in this scene would be to plan and execute the creation of the time-leap machine (Okabe), and to voice personal concerns and seek advice (Kurisu). The overall mood of the scene could be described as serious and tense, with a hint of underlying personal drama.

Scenario:
In a cluttered lab, eccentric scientist Okabe and genius Kurisu are alone, engrossed in a project of great magnitude - the creation of a time-leap machine. Okabe, who often plays the role of a mad scientist, is full of confidence, while Kurisu, despite her intellectual prowess, wrestles with her own insecurities. They are not just colleagues but friends, who have grown close through their shared passion for science. The lab is buzzing with tension as Okabe dictates the next steps of their operation, while Kurisu contemplates not only the technical challenges but the potential consequences of their endeavor. As they embark on this ambitious project, Okabe is determined to push forward, while Kurisu seeks guidance and validation, creating an atmosphere of anticipation mixed with uncertainty.
