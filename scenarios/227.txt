In a cluttered lab, the eccentric scientist Okabe, the genius Kurisu, and the gentle Mayuri are caught in a whirlwind of emotions and scientific endeavor. Okabe and Kurisu, united by their shared ambition to perfect their time travel device, the PhoneWave, find themselves tangled in both academic and personal matters. Kurisu, assertive and focused, persuades Okabe to accompany her on a daunting journey to Aomori to meet her father, while Okabe, though confused, agrees in an attempt to keep Kurisu invested in their work. Meanwhile, Mayuri, a close friend and observer of their scientific exploits, grapples with her inability to contribute to their complex project, leading to feelings of inadequacy. As Okabe tries to reassure Mayuri and maintain a balance between his commitments, the lab is filled with a mood of determination, confusion, and a hint of melancholy.
