 Inside the Future Gadget Lab, a makeshift hub for scientific explorations, Okabe, the eccentric leader, engages in a conversation with Mayuri, a long-time friend and unofficial 'hostage' of the lab. They share a familial bond, with Okabe often providing guidance for the innocent and easily distracted Mayuri. Okabe, amused yet exasperated, recounts the story of their friend, Daru's, decision to join the lab, and Mayuri's tendency to lose focus. Amidst their ongoing project â€“ a time travel experiment involving sending messages and memories into the past, Okabe aims to reassure Mayuri of her key role in the lab and keep her focused on their current task: gathering components for the time leap machine. The atmosphere is light-hearted but tinged with the seriousness and urgency of their impending experiment.
