 In the cluttered Future Gadget Laboratory, eccentric scientist Okabe finds himself deep in conversation with Mayuri, his long-time friend known for her sweet innocence. They are discussing their recent discoveries in time travel - specifically the differences between "Time Leaps" and "D-mails," the former being a method to send one's current memories back to their past self, while the latter involves sending instructions to the past via text messages. As Okabe painstakingly explains these concepts, Mayuri, eager to understand, questions the implications of these discoveries, especially the risks and ethical considerations involved. Okabe, grappling with the uncertainties himself, tries to provide answers, his goal being to ease Mayuri's concerns while also working through his own understanding. This scene carries a mixed mood of curiosity and apprehension, as the characters delve into the complex and uncertain world of time travel.
