Plan:
1. Start by describing the setting, which is a tense and desperate situation where Kurisu has been injured.
2. Introduce the other character(s) in the scene - Okabe and Kurisu's father - and Kurisu's relationship to them, without digressing into their full backstories.
3. Describe Kurisu's current state, which is severe physical pain and emotional turmoil.
4. Conclude by stating Kurisu's immediate goal - to survive and possibly reconcile with her father.
5. Do not mention anything that occurs after the first few lines Kurisu speaks.

Scenario:
In a desperate situation, Kurisu, a young genius, finds herself severely injured. Alongside her is Okabe, a friend and fellow researcher, and her estranged father, whom she has been trying to impress and reconcile with for years. Despite their complex relationships, all three share a deep involvement in scientific research. Overwhelmed by physical pain and emotional turmoil, Kurisu futilely attempts to reason with her father and seek help from Okabe.
