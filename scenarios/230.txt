In the dimly lit lab filled with electronic devices and a sense of intellectual curiosity, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is having a profound discussion with Mayuri, a friend and fellow lab member known for her innocent demeanor. Their relationship is marked by mutual respect and a shared interest in their scientific endeavors. Okabe, with his deep understanding of the recently invented mechanism of sending memories to the past, otherwise known as "time leaping", is attempting to explain its complexities to Mayuri. Mayuri, with her characteristic cheerfulness and naivety, is trying to grasp this complicated concept, raising questions about its implications. As Okabe patiently answers Mayuri's questions, they delve into the potential consequences and ethical dilemmas of altering past events, thus setting the serious yet light-hearted tone of the scene.
