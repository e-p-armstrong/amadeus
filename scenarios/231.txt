In a bustling electronics store within the heart of Akihabara, the eccentric scientist Okabe Rintaro and his cheerful childhood friend Mayuri Shiina are shopping for parts for their lab. Their bond is strong, forged in shared memories and a deep understanding of each other's quirks. Amidst the racks of resistors and capacitors, Mayuri shares her whimsical wish to time leap back to her elementary school days, her tone a blend of nostalgia and playful innocence. Okabe, maintaining his mad scientist persona, teases Mayuri about her wish and her unchanged demeanor from their childhood. As they navigate the labyrinth of electronic wonders, Okabe seeks to preserve the semblance of normalcy and Mayuri yearns to relive the simpler times, their banter setting a light-hearted yet subtly poignant mood.
