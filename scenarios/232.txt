In a nondescript location, near a staircase, Okabe and Mayuri, members of a small but ambitious research team, stumble upon their enigmatic colleague, Moeka. Despite working together in the lab, their relationship is marked by Okabe's eccentricities, Mayuri's light-heartedness, and Moeka's silence. As Okabe and Mayuri approach Moeka, they notice her worn-out state, her eyes ringed with fatigue and her gaze locked onto her phone, her usual mode of communication. They have been working on a groundbreaking project â€” a device they've dubbed the "PhoneWave", which they believe could potentially manipulate time, and they've recently hacked into a large research organization, SERN, to aid their work. As they engage with Moeka, Okabe and Mayuri's goal is to understand the reason behind her sudden appearance while keeping their project a secret. The overall mood of the scene, a blend of casual conversation, underlying tension, and the excitement of their secretive research, sets the stage for their interaction.
