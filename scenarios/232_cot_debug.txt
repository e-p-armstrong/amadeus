Brainstorm:

1. Location: The location seems to be near a staircase where Moeka is found squatting. Okabe and Mayuri are also there.
2. Relationships: Okabe, Mayuri, and Moeka are all lab members, they are colleagues but their relationship isn't very warm. Okabe has a somewhat eccentric personality, often talking in a dramatic way and referring to himself as a mad scientist. Mayuri is a friendlier character, while Moeka is generally silent and communicates through her phone.
3. Emotional / Mental States: Okabe seems to be in his usual eccentric state, but also concerned about Moeka. Mayuri is cheerful and friendly. Moeka is visibly tired and emotionally detached.
4. Significant events: They have been working on a device (referred to as PhoneWave) that they believe could potentially time travel. Moeka is also a journalist and seems interested in this discovery.
5. Goals: Okabe and Mayuri are trying to understand Moeka's sudden appearance and also maintain secrecy about their invention. Moeka seems to be interested in their work.
6. Mood: The scene is a mix of tension (due to Moeka's sudden appearance and their secret work) and casual interaction.
7. Special Terms: PhoneWave is their time-travel device, SERN is a research organization they have hacked into for their research.

Scenario:
In a nondescript location, near a staircase, Okabe and Mayuri, members of a small but ambitious research team, stumble upon their enigmatic colleague, Moeka. Despite working together in the lab, their relationship is marked by Okabe's eccentricities, Mayuri's light-heartedness, and Moeka's silence. As Okabe and Mayuri approach Moeka, they notice her worn-out state, her eyes ringed with fatigue and her gaze locked onto her phone, her usual mode of communication. They have been working on a groundbreaking project â€” a device they've dubbed the "PhoneWave", which they believe could potentially manipulate time, and they've recently hacked into a large research organization, SERN, to aid their work. As they engage with Moeka, Okabe and Mayuri's goal is to understand the reason behind her sudden appearance while keeping their project a secret. The overall mood of the scene, a blend of casual conversation, underlying tension, and the excitement of their secretive research, sets the stage for their interaction.
