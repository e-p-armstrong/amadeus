3. Describe Kurisu's emotional state and the atmosphere of the scene.
4. End with Kurisu's goal for the scene - trying to have a conversation with her father Nakabachi.

Scenario:
Due to an escalating argument, Kurisu finds herself at odds with Nakabachi, her estranged father, in a dimly lit room while Okabe, an observer of this conflict, hides nearby. Kurisu's relationship with her father is strained, and she is meeting him after a long time, whereas she is unaware of Okabe's presence. The atmosphere is filled with tension and bitter resentment, making the situation unpleasant for Kurisu. Despite the hostility, Kurisu is attempting to engage her father in a discussion about her research, hoping to reconcile and bridge the gap between them.
