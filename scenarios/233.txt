In a tense standoff, Kurisu finds herself being attacked by Nakabachi, her own father, who is overcome with jealousy and resentment over her genius. Okabe, an eccentric individual who has somehow found himself in this volatile situation, steps in to intervene. Kurisu is all too familiar with Nakabachi's violent tendencies, but Okabe is a stranger to her, their paths having crossed under these extraordinary circumstances. As Okabe boldly confronts Nakabachi, Kurisu's immediate concern shifts from her own safety to trying to convince Okabe to flee from the escalating danger.
