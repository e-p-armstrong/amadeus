 The scene unfolds in a makeshift laboratory, where Okabe and Kurisu, two dedicated scientists, are amidst a break from their intense research. Their relationship is often marked by intellectual sparring, and this moment is no different, except instead of debating scientific theories, Okabe is playfully teasing Kurisu about her use of @channel - a popular online forum. Kurisu, usually confident and unflappable, is flustered, fighting to keep this part of her personal life under wraps. This is a departure from the seriousness of their recent experiences, where they have been working tirelessly on a time leap machine - a device designed to send memories back to the past. As Okabe continues to prod at Kurisu's secret, she is determined to steer the conversation away from her online habits. The mood is light and playful, a moment of respite amidst their high-stakes work.
