 The scene unfolds in a cluttered lab, where friends and lab partners Mayuri, Okabe, and Kurisu have gathered for another late-night work session. Mayuri, normally the first to leave, has decided to stay overnight to finish sewing a costume, a decision that sparks concern in Okabe, the lab's self-proclaimed 'mad scientist.' Meanwhile, Kurisu, a sharp-witted and somewhat cynical genius, is engrossed in tinkering with their latest experimental technology, occasionally poking fun at Okabe's eccentricities. The mood is light-hearted, yet there's a tinge of worry from Okabe about Mayuri's unusual decision to stay overnight. As they settle into their tasks, each character aims to accomplish their individual goals: Mayuri to finish her costume, Okabe to ensure Mayuri's well-being, and Kurisu to advance their technological project while dealing with Okabe's dramatics.
