Plan:
1. Set the context of Okabe's recent experiences within the changed worldline and his mixed feelings about it.
2. Describe the unexpected encounter with Kurisu, emphasizing that she appears unexpectedly and that Okabe is surprised because he believed she had left the country.
3. Explain Kurisu's relation to Okabe, that they are essentially strangers in this worldline but had shared experiences in another, which only Okabe remembers.
4. Describe Kurisu's current state, surprised and possibly confused to see Okabe.
5. Conclude with Kurisu's intention, which is to engage with Okabe after unexpectedly seeing him.

Scenario:
Okabe has found himself in a worldline that is seemingly ordinary, where no major events or changes have caught his attention. During a casual stroll in town, he unexpectedly crosses paths with Kurisu, the genius scientist he assumed had already left for America. In this worldline, Kurisu and Okabe are essentially strangers, with no shared experiences or history, except for a brief interaction at a lecture. However, Okabe harbors memories of a different worldline where they were close. Upon spotting Okabe, Kurisu displays a shocked expression, and despite their limited interaction in this worldline, she decides to approach and engage with him.
