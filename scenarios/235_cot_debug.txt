Brainstorm:

1. Location and Characters: The scene takes place in a lab. Okabe, Mayuri, and Kurisu are present. Mayuri is working on a costume, Okabe is overseeing, and Kurisu is tinkering with a device.
2. Relationships: Okabe, Mayuri, and Kurisu are friends and lab partners. Okabe and Kurisu have a more competitive dynamic, while Mayuri is generally more carefree and unassuming.
3. Emotional State: Okabe is concerned about Mayuri staying late, Kurisu is teasing Okabe and is slightly annoyed, and Mayuri is focused and determined on her task.
4. Significant events: Mayuri has decided to stay overnight at the lab to finish her costume, a decision she has never made before. The device Kurisu is working on is a piece of experimental technology (which we will describe in more generic terms).
5. Characters' goals: Okabe is trying to ensure Mayuri's safety, Mayuri is trying to finish her costume, and Kurisu is working on their device while teasing Okabe.
6. Mood: The scene is light-hearted with a touch of concern from Okabe about Mayuri's decision.

Special Terms: PhoneWave - this is a device the characters are working on. We'll describe it as an experimental piece of technology they're developing.

Scenario: The scene unfolds in a cluttered lab, where friends and lab partners Mayuri, Okabe, and Kurisu have gathered for another late-night work session. Mayuri, normally the first to leave, has decided to stay overnight to finish sewing a costume, a decision that sparks concern in Okabe, the lab's self-proclaimed 'mad scientist.' Meanwhile, Kurisu, a sharp-witted and somewhat cynical genius, is engrossed in tinkering with their latest experimental technology, occasionally poking fun at Okabe's eccentricities. The mood is light-hearted, yet there's a tinge of worry from Okabe about Mayuri's unusual decision to stay overnight. As they settle into their tasks, each character aims to accomplish their individual goals: Mayuri to finish her costume, Okabe to ensure Mayuri's well-being, and Kurisu to advance their technological project while dealing with Okabe's dramatics.
