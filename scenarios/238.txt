 In a modest, cluttered lab, the eccentric scientist Okabe, the brilliant Kurisu, and the skilled hacker Itaru are discussing the final adjustments needed for their time-travel experiment. Okabe, known for his dramatic persona, is tasked with managing their gruff and intimidating landlord, Mister Braun, who runs an old-fashioned television shop directly below the lab. Okabe is feeling the pressure of being the one who always has to handle their landlord, while Kurisu and Itaru, showing a blend of concern and amusement, delegate this responsibility to him due to their own conflicts with Mister Braun. Before Okabe leaves, Mayuri, a sweet and caring member of their group, expresses her worry for him, adding to the tension. The goal of each character is to successfully complete their time-travel experiment without causing further issues with their landlord. The overall mood is a mix of nervous anticipation and underlying camaraderie.
