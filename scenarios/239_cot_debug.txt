Scenario:
In a store that serves as their workspace, Okabe Rintaro, the eccentric scientist, finds himself amidst his stern boss Tennouji, Tennouji's timid daughter Nae, and his co-worker Suzuha. Okabe and Suzuha, despite being of the same age, share a relationship akin to comrades, bound by a shared mission. Okabe, with his ability to remember alternate timelines, known as his "Reading Steiner," foresees an impending earthquake, and is struggling with how to warn his co-workers without causing panic. Meanwhile, Suzuha, despite working alongside Okabe and another colleague Kurisu, harbors suspicion towards Kurisu and urges Okabe to be cautious around her. The scene is fraught with tension, as Okabe grapples with his knowledge of the upcoming disaster, Suzuha's distrust of Kurisu, and Tennouji's protective stance over his daughter Nae.
