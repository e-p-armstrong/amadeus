 In a small, cluttered laboratory located in a building owned by Tennouji, also known as Mister Braun, Okabe finds himself in a heated discussion with Suzuha, a time traveler from the future. They have been working together to prevent a dystopian future, but Suzuha's recent accusation that Kurisu, a fellow scientist and friend of Okabe, is connected to the ominous organization SERN, creates a rift. Okabe, shocked and in denial, grapples with the thought of Kurisu, who he knows as a passionate scientist, being associated with SERN, an organization seeking control of time travel for malicious purposes. Amidst the tension, the lab suddenly starts shaking, much to the dismay of Tennouji and his daughter Nae who are unaware of the lab's time-travel experiments. As the ground quivers beneath them, Suzuha tries to convince Okabe of Kurisu's potential threat, Okabe wrestles with his trust, and Tennouji demands the cessation of activities shaking his building, setting a tense and chaotic atmosphere.
