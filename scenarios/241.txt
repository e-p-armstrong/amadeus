Our eclectic group of friends and researchers find themselves in Tennouji's electronics workshop, a place filled with old and new tech. The relationships are a mix between friends, fellow researchers, and the strained tenant-landlord relationship between Okabe and Tennouji. Okabe is caught in a wave of triumphant excitement after discovering that Tennouji's 42-inch CRT TV could be the missing piece in their ongoing research. On the other hand, Tennouji is annoyed and worried about possible damage to his precious TV and is ready to make Okabe pay for any potential damage. Meanwhile, the rest of the group - Kurisu, Itaru, and Mayuri - are watching this unfold from a distance, filled with a mix of curiosity and concern about Okabe's discovery. This scene is a chaotic mix of emotions, with excitement, annoyance, relief, and curiosity creating a unique atmosphere.
