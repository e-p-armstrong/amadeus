The scene unfolds in a makeshift laboratory, where a group of friends - Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru - are engrossed in a project of immense significance. Okabe and Kurisu, the intellectual drivers of the group, are deep in scientific discussion, while Mayuri and Itaru lend their unique perspectives and support. The atmosphere is thick with a blend of intellectual excitement and tension, accentuated by the recent discovery that a nearby TV's cathode ray tube (CRT) is a vital component to their experimental device - the PhoneWave, which they believe can send memories and messages into the past. As they delve into the technicalities, Kurisu formulates a theory about the CRT's impact on their device's functioning, sparking a need to turn the TV back on. Despite Okabe's initial resistance, Kurisu insists, highlighting the importance of this step in their pursuit of understanding time travel.
