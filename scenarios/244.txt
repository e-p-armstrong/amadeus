In a small electronics store, the eccentric scientist Okabe Rintaro and his enthusiastic lab mate Suzuha are trying to make amends with the store's owner, Tennouji, a man built like a bear. Okabe, known for his dramatic flair, had previously upset Tennouji and now finds himself in a precarious situation of trying to apologize. His plan involves a surprise and the help of Suzuha, who is also an employee at the store. Amidst the tension, the device they've been working on at their lab, the PhoneWave—a microwave that can send texts to the past, causing a noticeable shake when activated—is set to go off. Okabe's goal is to create a distraction and buy enough time for the PhoneWave to activate, while Suzuha, eager to assist, uses unconventional tactics to keep Tennouji preoccupied. The scene is a blend of tension and humor as the characters navigate this chaotic situation.
