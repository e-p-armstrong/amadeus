In a cluttered lab strewn with electronic components, four friends - Okabe, Mayuri, Itaru, and Kurisu - stand around an odd contraption, the fruits of their labor over the past three days. This device, a time machine they've named the "PhoneWave," has been their shared dream and obsession, bringing them closer together. Mayuri, ever the cheerful artist, is excited about her finished costume, while Itaru, the group's resident tech geek, yearns for rest and comfort. Kurisu, the genius scientist with a prickly exterior, and Okabe, the eccentric "mad scientist," share an unspoken concern about the implications of their creation. As they bicker over what to call their upgraded PhoneWave, now a "Time Leap Machine" that can send memories to the past, what weighs heavily on their minds is the daunting question: What are they going to do with it? The scene is an uneasy mix of accomplishment, exhaustion, and apprehension, as they stand on the brink of an uncertain future.
