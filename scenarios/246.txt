In a cluttered lab filled with mismatched equipment, four friends find themselves at the precipice of a scientific breakthrough. Okabe, the group's eccentric leader, shares the space with Mayuri, his cheerful childhood friend, Kurisu, a brilliant scientist, and Itaru, the group's tech expert. Together, they have created a device that can send memories back in time, a "Time Leap Machine." In the midst of their excitement and apprehension, Okabe urges Kurisu to explain the workings of the machine, hoping to fully understand what they've created. As Kurisu begins her explanation, the others listen intently, each one aware that they are stepping into uncharted territory. The atmosphere in the lab is filled with a mix of anticipation and unease, as they grapple with the enormity of their invention.
