 In the humming, gadget-filled Future Gadget Laboratory, Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru are engaged in a deep discussion about their time machine, known as the "PhoneWave". Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, and Kurisu, a genius scientist with a sharp tongue, often clash in their quest for knowledge, while Itaru, the resident hacker, lightens the mood with his inappropriate humor. They're exploring the intricacies of how the time machine compresses memories, sends them back in time, and decompresses them into the recipient's brain. As Kurisu carefully explains the process, the tension in the room is palpable, broken only by Itaru's humorous quips. The scene is a blend of intensity and lightheartedness as the characters grapple with the mind-bending implications of their invention.
