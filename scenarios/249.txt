 In a tech-filled lab, friends and scientists Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru are deep in a discussion about the theories and implications of time travel and memory transfer. They have been conducting experiments with a method they refer to as "D-Mail," a way to send messages to the past, and Okabe has a unique ability they call "Reading Steiner," which allows him to retain his memories across different timelines. Amidst the whir of machines and the smell of solder, they debate the possible outcomes of sending one's memories to the past - a concept that fascinates and terrifies them in equal measure. Okabe, with a hint of fear in his voice, questions the risk of memory loss and the potential conflict between past, present, and future selves. Their goal is to peel away at the layers of time travel, to understand its consequences, and to find a way to safely conduct their experiments. The atmosphere is thick with intellectual tension and uncertainty, as they tread on the edge of the known and the unknown.
