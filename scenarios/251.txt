 Okabe and Kurisu, two colleagues with a shared goal and mutual respect for each other's skills, are walking together in a public place. Despite the playful antagonism between them, Kurisu is wrestling with feelings of gratitude towards Okabe, which she's uncomfortable expressing. They've recently developed a device capable of sending memories to the past, which they've decided not to use. Their conversation revolves around this decision and the consequences of making their invention public. Amid the tension of their situation, they manage to maintain a sense of humor, teasing and bantering with each other.
