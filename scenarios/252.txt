 
In the Braun Tube Workshop, Okabe Rintaro, Itaru, Mayuri, and Kurisu gather, relieved after the completion of their shared project, the Time Leap Machine- a device designed to send memories to the past. The friends, bonded by shared experiences and the intense pursuit of their scientific endeavors, are now trying to enjoy a moment of relaxation, with pizza boxes and casual banter filling the room. Mayuri, known for her love of costumes and cute things, attempts to convince the usually serious Kurisu to participate in cosplay, adding a light-hearted twist to their typical scientific discussions. Kurisu, caught off guard by the proposition, blushes and seems to consider the idea, showing a side of herself the others haven't seen before. The scene unfolds with a sense of camaraderie and playful teasing, as they navigate their friendships and shared interests outside of their intense scientific pursuits.
