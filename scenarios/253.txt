 At the laboratory, where a group of friends often gather to work on their scientific experiments, an unexpected argument has broken out. Kurisu, a brilliant scientist, is locked in a heated dispute with Suzuha, a time-traveler who has previously warned Okabe, the group's self-proclaimed "mad scientist", about Kurisu's potential threat. Okabe, caught off guard by the sudden tension, tries to mediate between the two, while his childhood friend Mayuri watches anxiously, imploring for peace. This scene unfolds against the backdrop of a previous warning from Suzuha about a dangerous organization, "SERN", and a potential threat posed by Kurisu. As Kurisu defends herself and Suzuha insists on her prediction, Okabe attempts to defuse the explosive situation, and Mayuri hopes for the restoration of their group's harmony. The overall mood is tense, filled with confrontations and undercurrents of unease.
