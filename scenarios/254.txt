 

In the Future Gadget Laboratory, a place for conducting futuristic experiments, Okabe and Mayuri are having a conversation. They are old friends and founding lab members who have seen their group grow from a quiet two-person operation to a bustling eight-member team. Okabe, the eccentric founder, and Mayuri, a peaceful and reliable presence, are reminiscing about the lab's past and discussing its future. They've come a long way from the lab's humble beginnings on the outskirts of Akiba, having developed a machine that can send memories to the past and attracting a diverse group of members. The conversation focuses on practical matters such as buying new chairs and a microwave, as well as Mayuri's anticipation of using her favorite Juicy Chicken Number One again. Okabe reassures Mayuri about their financial future, while Mayuri expresses joy about the lab's growth and the friendships they've made. The scene is filled with a sense of camaraderie and optimism for the future.
