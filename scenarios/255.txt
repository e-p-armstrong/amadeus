Within the lab space, a group of friends — Okabe, Suzuha, Itaru, Mayuri, and Kurisu — are gathered, having worked together on a project to build a Time Leap Machine, a device capable of sending memories back in time. Their usual camaraderie is strained as a news bulletin interrupts their conversation, reporting a bomb threat in Akihabara, a location that holds significance for them, especially for Mayuri who has to journey home through the affected area. Okabe, the group's eccentric yet passionate leader, can't shake off a sense of foreboding as he starts to suspect a link between their project and the threat. This is further amplified when Suzuha, usually calm and composed, abruptly asks about the completion status of the Time Leap Machine before leaving the lab. The scene is fraught with tension and uncertainty, as each of them tries to process the news and its potential implications, with Okabe in particular grappling with the fear that their project may have inadvertently created a dangerous situation.
