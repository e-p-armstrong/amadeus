 Inside the cluttered confines of their laboratory in Akihabara, Okabe, Kurisu, Daru, and Mayuri find themselves in a tense standoff with Moeka, a recent addition to their research team. Previously a strange but seemingly harmless individual, Moeka's sudden aggression is a shock to the core team. In the wake of their groundbreaking research into time travel, the lab has drawn the attention of dangerous forces, culminating in this moment where Moeka, gun in hand, demands Okabe, Kurisu, and Daru to come with her. Outside, a bomb threat has shut down public transportation, trapping them in Akihabara. As Okabe grapples with understanding Moeka's betrayal and her exclusion of Mayuri from her demands, the atmosphere in the lab is thick with fear and confusion, each member desperately trying to make sense of their rapidly unravelling reality.
