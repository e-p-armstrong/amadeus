The scene most likely takes place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, after the lab members have made important discoveries related to time travel and have attracted the attention of a hostile organization. The characters involved are Rintaro Okabe, Kurisu Makise, Itaru "Daru" Hashida, Mayuri Shiina, and Moeka Kiryu. Okabe, Kurisu, Daru, and Mayuri are the core team of the lab, while Moeka has been a more recent, albeit strange, addition. They were previously friendly, but the scene suggests a drastic shift in Moeka's role. 

Before the scene, it's clear that the lab members have been conducting experiments that have started to draw unwanted attention. The immediate situation seems to be a hostage scenario initiated by Moeka, who has revealed a gun and is demanding that Okabe, Kurisu, and Daru come with her. 

"Lab mem" probably refers to members of their lab and research team. There's an implication that there is a bomb threat and that the public transportation system in the area, Akihabara, has been shut down, likely engineered by Moeka's group. The "three of us" likely refers to Okabe, Kurisu, and Daru, but does not include Mayuri, which is causing confusion amongst the group. 

In this scene, Okabe's goal is to understand why Moeka is doing this and what her intentions are. Moeka's goal is to get Okabe, Kurisu, and Daru to comply with her demands. The other characters are in shock and are seeking guidance from Okabe, their usual leader. 

The overall mood of the scene is tense and fearful. The lab members are in a dangerous situation and are facing an unexpected betrayal from one of their own.

Scenario: Inside the cluttered confines of their laboratory in Akihabara, Okabe, Kurisu, Daru, and Mayuri find themselves in a tense standoff with Moeka, a recent addition to their research team. Previously a strange but seemingly harmless individual, Moeka's sudden aggression is a shock to the core team. In the wake of their groundbreaking research into time travel, the lab has drawn the attention of dangerous forces, culminating in this moment where Moeka, gun in hand, demands Okabe, Kurisu, and Daru to come with her. Outside, a bomb threat has shut down public transportation, trapping them in Akihabara. As Okabe grapples with understanding Moeka's betrayal and her exclusion of Mayuri from her demands, the atmosphere in the lab is thick with fear and confusion, each member desperately trying to make sense of their rapidly unravelling reality.
