In a high-tech lab filled with unease and desperation, Okabe, a scientist with a daring plan, stands alongside his fellow scientist and friend, Kurisu, and their time-travelling ally, Suzuha.

Okabe, filled with determination and fear, is about to risk everything by initiating a time leap—a process of sending memories back in time—in an attempt to save his friend Mayuri from an impending death. Kurisu, who's also worried for Okabe's safety, assists him, while Suzuha tries to fend off the attackers. The intense, high-stakes nature of the scene is amplified by everyone's desperate struggle for survival and the impending uncertainty that the time leap brings.
