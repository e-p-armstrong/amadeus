 In a silent, lonely cemetery, Okabe finds himself in a desperate attempt to connect with his dear friend Mayuri. Their relationship, previously laced with lightheartedness, is now strained and marked by Okabe's fear of losing Mayuri, who remains distant and unresponsive. Okabe, plagued by insecurities and haunted by the fear of abandonment, resorts to invoking playful memories of a shared past â€” a popular TV series they used to watch together. He adopts the persona of the show's villainous mad scientist, declaring Mayuri as his "hostage" in an attempt to break her silence. This scene is a heart-wrenching, emotional struggle, where Okabe is desperate to keep Mayuri close, while Mayuri, clouded by her own emotional turmoil, finds solace in Okabe's words.
