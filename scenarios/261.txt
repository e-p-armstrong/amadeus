In a laboratory brimming with scientific equipment, Okabe, a passionate scientist known for his eccentric behavior, stands dazed and disoriented in front of a peculiar machine designed to transmit human memories back in time. His friends, the brilliant and pragmatic Kurisu, and Daru, a skilled hacker, are present but unaware of his recent temporal journey. Okabe is visibly struggling with the aftereffects of his temporal leap, his mind caught between the time he's left and the one he's arrived in, his body slow to respond. Kurisu, concerned by his behavior, tries to get his attention, unaware that she's speaking to a friend who has just journeyed through time. As Okabe grapples with his disorientation and tries to understand his temporal position, Kurisu attempts to understand his sudden, strange behavior, creating an atmosphere of tension, urgency, and confusion.
