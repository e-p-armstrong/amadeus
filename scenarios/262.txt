 In a shared lab filled with scientific equipment, Okabe finds himself among his friends: the computer-savvy Daru, the genius scientist Kurisu, and the ever-cheerful Mayuri. Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is close friends with Daru and Mayuri, and shares a deeper, more complex connection with Kurisu. Having recently experienced a vivid and troubling dream or vision, Okabe is beset by a lingering anxiety, even as he tries to convince himself it was nothing more than a nightmare. The conversation around him is lighthearted, filled with talk of costumes and an upcoming cosplay event, a shared hobby that brings them all together. While Okabe grapples with his internal turmoil, his friends are blissfully unaware, their focus instead on the excitement of their cosplay plans. The mood is a juxtaposition of underlying unease and casual camaraderie.
