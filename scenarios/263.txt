In a bustling lab teeming with activity and conversation, a group of friends — Okabe, Mayuri, Daru, Suzuha, and Kurisu — navigate the complexities of their shared work and interpersonal dynamics. They are each deeply involved in a significant project, developing a 'Time Leap Machine' that appears to hold substantial importance. Okabe, however, is preoccupied, haunted by a dream that he can't shake off, its disturbing contents shadowing his every thought. As Mayuri strives to maintain harmony amongst the group and Daru grapples with the logistical problem posed by an external crisis — a local bomb threat — Okabe struggles to remain present, his focus fractured by his inner turmoil. The tension in the room is palpable, a stark contrast to Mayuri's efforts to maintain a sense of normalcy, while each individual tries to navigate their personal challenges amidst the escalating situation.
