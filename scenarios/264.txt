 In the gloom of a scientific laboratory, Okabe, Kurisu, Daru, and Mayuri find themselves in a dire situation. Mayuri, one of their own, has just been killed, and the group is under threat from Moeka and her team who have invaded their sanctum. Okabe, filled with guilt and grief, struggles to control his rage, while Kurisu, driven by a desperate need to keep him safe, tries to reason with him. Amidst the standoff, an ally, Suzuha, intervenes, giving Okabe and Kurisu a chance to utilize their time travel device â€” the 'headgear.' The scene is fraught with intense emotions of despair, desperation, and anger, as each character battles their own fears and seeks a way out of this deadly encounter."
