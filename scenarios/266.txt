Their relationship is a complex dance of respect and exasperation, born from countless shared experiences. Okabe, in a state of high tension and urgency, abruptly leaves the lab, leaving Kurisu in confusion. This sudden panic is the result of Okabe's recent realization that his attempts to manipulate time have led to his dear friend Mayuri's death in various timelines. As Okabe races against the clock, desperately trying to locate Mayuri before history repeats itself, Kurisu is left grappling for understanding, her goal to decipher Okabe's sudden frantic behavior. The scene is thick with anxiety and desperation, a haunting race against time.
