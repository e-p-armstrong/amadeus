In the cluttered workspace of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Okabe Rintaro finds himself in a desperate race against time, his friend Itaru "Daru" Hashida at his side. Their usually jovial relationship is strained by the uncharacteristic tension radiating from Okabe, who is grappling with a harrowing premonition of imminent danger â€” a clandestine organization, SERN, is set to raid their lab and eliminate their childhood friend, Mayuri. Okabe attempts to locate Mayuri while urging Daru to contact another lab member, Kurisu, warning her to stay away. Unbeknownst to them, Suzuha Amane, an acquaintance who works in the shop downstairs, is wrapping up her day, oblivious to the looming threat. The atmosphere is fraught with anxiety as Okabe and Daru scramble to prevent a tragedy, each second ticking away bringing them closer to the life-or-death showdown with SERN.
