Brainstorming:
The scene takes place at the Future Gadget Laboratory, with Okabe Rintaro, Itaru "Daru" Hashida, and Suzuha Amane present. Okabe and Daru are friends and fellow researchers, while Suzuha is a part-time employee at the shop downstairs and a casual acquaintance. Okabe is under immense stress, trying to locate Mayuri, his childhood friend, in order to avert her impending death at the hands of SERN, a powerful and secretive organization they've run afoul of. Daru is confused and worried, unaware of the danger until Okabe tells him. Suzuha is unaware and is closing up shop for the day. 

The key event leading up to this is that Okabe has travelled back in time to try and prevent Mayuri's death (the Time Leap Machine is a device that allows the user to send their memories back in time). Okabe's goal is to find Mayuri and escape before SERN's agents arrive, while Daru's primary goal becomes to contact Kurisu, another lab member, and warn her to stay away. Suzuha is unaware of the tension and her goal is to finish closing up for the day. The mood is tense and urgent.

Steins;Gate-specific terms: Future Gadget Laboratory (the shared workspace of the main characters), SERN (the organization that's threatening them), Time Leap Machine (the machine they've developed to send memories back in time).

Scenario:
In the cluttered workspace of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Okabe Rintaro finds himself in a desperate race against time, his friend Itaru "Daru" Hashida at his side. Their usually jovial relationship is strained by the uncharacteristic tension radiating from Okabe, who is grappling with a harrowing premonition of imminent danger â€” a clandestine organization, SERN, is set to raid their lab and eliminate their childhood friend, Mayuri. Okabe attempts to locate Mayuri while urging Daru to contact another lab member, Kurisu, warning her to stay away. Unbeknownst to them, Suzuha Amane, an acquaintance who works in the shop downstairs, is wrapping up her day, oblivious to the looming threat. The atmosphere is fraught with anxiety as Okabe and Daru scramble to prevent a tragedy, each second ticking away bringing them closer to the life-or-death showdown with SERN.
