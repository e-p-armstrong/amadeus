Given the provided context, the scene seems to be taking place within the latter half of the story, after Okabe has started remembering the original timelines due to his "Reading Steiner" ability. The party is an event occurring in the present timeline, and Suzuha, a part-time worker who's also a time-traveler, has been invited. Okabe, the protagonist, is acting strangely due to his memories of other timelines, specifically one where Mayuri, a close friend, is killed. His goal in this scene is to prevent Mayuri's death, which he believes will happen soon. The scene starts at the location of the party, and then transitions to the street, where Okabe spots Mayuri. The other characters, Suzuha and Tennouji (Suzuha's boss and a friend of Okabe's), are confused by Okabe's behavior. The overall mood of the scene is tense and desperate.

Scenario: Okabe, a troubled young man who can remember events from altered timelines, is in the middle of a party with his friends, including Suzuha, a part-time worker with a secret, and Tennouji, her boss. Suzuha is a newcomer to the group, invited by Mayuri, a dear friend of Okabe's. Despite the festive atmosphere, Okabe is on edge, plagued by haunting memories of a timeline where Mayuri was killed. He abruptly cancels the party and asks Suzuha to leave, causing confusion among the attendees. Okabe's primary goal is to prevent Mayuri's death, which he believes is imminent, so when he spots her on the street, he immediately rushes to her. Amidst the confusion, the mood of the scene is desperate, as Okabe attempts to change a future only he can remember.
