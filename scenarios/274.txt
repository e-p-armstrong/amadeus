He's trying to gather information about Mayuri's activities for the day, just in case he needs to replay the day to prevent a yet unknown disaster. Meanwhile, Mayuri, a trusting soul, reassures Okabe that she'll patiently wait for his explanations about their unusual circumstances, even as she shares the mundane details of her day. The scene is a tense blend of normalcy and suspense, as beneath the facade of an ordinary conversation, the undercurrent of uneasiness and the possibility of a time leap loom large.
