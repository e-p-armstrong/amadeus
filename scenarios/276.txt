 On a secluded spot overlooking a public plaza, Okabe, a scientist who has been using a time travel device to prevent a tragic event, finds himself caught in a serious conversation with Kurisu, his fellow researcher and confidante. Over time, their professional relationship has evolved into a deeper bond, with their shared work in time travel and the recent death of their friend Mayuri serving as catalysts. Okabe, stricken with guilt and desperation, confesses his repeated, failed attempts to save Mayuri by using the time travel device - a machine they built together that enables one to send their memories back in time. Kurisu, alarmed by Okabe's revelations, warns him of the potential dangers of his actions, including the horrifying possibility of becoming disconnected from reality itself. In this emotionally heavy scene, Okabe seeks understanding and absolution, while Kurisu attempts to provide counsel, creating an atmosphere of tension and despair.
