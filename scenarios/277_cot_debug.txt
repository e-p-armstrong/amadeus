First, let's plan our scenario based on the lines provided:

1. Location and characters: The scene seems to take place in a private location, most likely a lab, where Okabe and Kurisu are having a serious discussion. Other characters like Mayuri, Daru, and Suzuha are mentioned but are not present in the initial discussion. They appear later when Okabe and Kurisu return to the lab.
2. Relationship: Okabe and Kurisu share a close bond developed through shared work and experiences. They are both part of a lab and are referred to as 'lab mems' or lab members. Kurisu also mentions a trip to Aomori, indicating a personal connection.
3. Emotional and mental states: Okabe is desperate and determined to save his friend Mayuri. He's aware of his limitations and needs Kurisu's help. Kurisu is portrayed as caring and concerned for Okabe, but also a bit embarrassed about showing her concern.
4. Significant events: Okabe has been attempting to change the future to save Mayuri, but his efforts have been unsuccessful. He's now seeking Kurisu's help to devise a better plan.
5. Goals: Okabe's goal is to save Mayuri, while Kurisu's goal is to help Okabe and relieve his pain. They both want to change the future.
6. Mood: The mood of the scene is tense, emotional, and somewhat hopeful. Okabe's desperation contrasts with Kurisu's composed and rational approach, adding to the tension.
7. Steins;Gate-specific terms: SERN is a research organization that is antagonistic to Okabe and his friends.

Now, let's write the scenario:

Scenario: Okabe and Kurisu find themselves in their shared workplace - a scientific lab, engaged in an intense discussion. They share a unique bond, forged through shared experiences and mutual respect, which is evident in their interaction. Okabe, desperate to change the future to save his dear friend Mayuri, pleads Kurisu for help, acknowledging his limitations. Kurisu, despite her usual stoicism, reveals a softer side as she agrees to assist him, driven by her concern for Okabe and her friendship with Mayuri. The overall mood is tense and emotional, as the two of them prepare to confront an antagonistic research organization (SERN) and change the course of the future.
