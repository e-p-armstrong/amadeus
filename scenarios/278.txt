 In a cluttered lab filled with electronics, Okabe and Kurisu stand on the brink of a desperate plan. As close allies, they have developed a machine that can send a person's memories back in time - a time-leap. Okabe, driven by desperation to save his friend Mayuri from an impending death, is about to use this machine, while Kurisu, analytical and concerned, assists him. They've sent messages to the past before - D-mails - but this is different, more personal and fraught with unknown risks. The mood is tense and suspenseful, with Okabe intending to leap back five hours to change events, and Kurisu providing support and guidance, while grappling with the uncertain implications of their actions.
