At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Okabe Rintaro, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru are gathered. Okabe and Kurisu, both scientists, have been working on a device they call the PhoneWave, capable of sending messages back in time. Recently, they've completed an upgrade that allows the transmission of memories - a process they term 'Time Leap'. Kurisu, having finished the upgrade, is eager to test it, while Okabe, nursing a headache from a previous altercation, is reluctant and wants to fully consider the implications of such a leap. Meanwhile, Mayuri, tired but content, is completing a costume she's been working on all night, and Itaru is immersed in his online activities. The mood in the lab is a mixture of achievement, anticipation, and underlying tension as they grapple with the potential consequences of their scientific breakthrough.
