Brainstorm:

1. The scene takes place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, where Okabe Rintaro, Mayuri, Kurisu, and Itaru are present.
2. Okabe and Kurisu are friends and fellow scientists who have been working on a device that can send memories back in time. Mayuri and Itaru are their friends and lab members.
3. Okabe seems to be in a state of mild distress, possibly due to a recent physical altercation, while Kurisu appears excited and eager. Mayuri seems tired but happy, and Itaru is distracted and playful.
4. Before this scene, Okabe and Kurisu developed a machine (the PhoneWave) that can send messages, and now memories, back in time. Kurisu has just finished upgrading the machine to send memories (Time Leap). However, Okabe has just had a physical altercation with someone outside the lab, and Mayuri has been working on a costume all night.
5. Okabe's goal in the scene is to consider the implications of time-leaping, while Kurisu wants to test the newly upgraded machine. Mayuri wants to finish her costume, and Itaru is just enjoying the moment.
6. The overall mood of the scene is mixed: there's a sense of achievement and anticipation due to the completion of the Time Leap Machine, but also apprehension and tension due to Okabe's reluctance to test it. 

Special Terms:
- PhoneWave: A machine that can send messages back in time.
- Time Leap: An upgraded feature of the PhoneWave that allows sending memories back in time.

Scenario:

At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Okabe Rintaro, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru are gathered. Okabe and Kurisu, both scientists, have been working on a device they call the PhoneWave, capable of sending messages back in time. Recently, they've completed an upgrade that allows the transmission of memories - a process they term 'Time Leap'. Kurisu, having finished the upgrade, is eager to test it, while Okabe, nursing a headache from a previous altercation, is reluctant and wants to fully consider the implications of such a leap. Meanwhile, Mayuri, tired but content, is completing a costume she's been working on all night, and Itaru is immersed in his online activities. The mood in the lab is a mixture of achievement, anticipation, and underlying tension as they grapple with the potential consequences of their scientific breakthrough.
