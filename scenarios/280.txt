 In a makeshift lab cluttered with electronics, Okabe Rintaro and Kurisu, two brilliant but unconventional scientists, are deep in conversation. A pair of their friends, Mayuri and Itaru, have just left, leaving Okabe and Kurisu alone to grapple with a staggering revelation. Okabe has just confessed to Kurisu that he has traveled from the future using a machine she invented, a device that can send a person's memories back in time. As Okabe struggles to convince the skeptical Kurisu of the truth of his claim, and as Kurisu wrestles with the implications of her invention once she is convinced, they both grapple with a shared, growing fear: that they have tampered with time in a way that could lead to disaster. The atmosphere is thick with tension, the bright spark of intellectual curiosity clouded over with a sense of foreboding as they confront the possible consequences of their actions.
