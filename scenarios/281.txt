Okabe and Kurisu, two passionate scientists and friends, are in their makeshift lab, engrossed in a heated discussion about their friend Mayuri's unchanging fate. Despite Okabe's numerous attempts to alter the past using what they call a 'time leap' - sending memories back in time to try and change events - Mayuri's death seems to be an unshakeable outcome. Okabe, desperate and teetering on the edge of despair, is trying to understand this relentless cycle, while Kurisu, although calm, is clearly concerned and diligently working to figure out a solution. They're discussing Okabe's unique ability called 'Reading Steiner', which allows him to remember changes in the timeline, and the potential involvement of a research organization, SERN, that has discovered their time machine. Their immediate goal is understanding why Mayuri's death remains constant despite their attempts to change the past, and find a way to alter this grim reality. The tension is palpable as the two grapple with despair and determination under the weight of their scientific discovery's unintended consequences.
