Brainstorming: 

The scene takes place after the discovery of the time machine and the subsequent time-leap attempts by Okabe to save Mayuri's life. The characters present are Okabe and Kurisu, engaged in a conversation about the continuous death of Mayuri, despite Okabe's attempts to alter it. Okabe's relationship with Kurisu is that of fellow scientists, friends, and unlikely confidants. They are both in a state of emotional turmoil: Okabe is desperate and on the verge of a breakdown after witnessing Mayuri's death multiple times, while Kurisu is calm, but clearly concerned and trying to figure out a solution. The significant event leading up to the scene is Mayuri's repeated death and Okabe's failed time-leap attempts to prevent it. The characters' goal in the scene is to understand why Mayuri keeps dying and figure out a way to change the outcome. The overall mood of the scene is tense, fraught with desperation, and anxiety. 

Steins;Gate-specific terms: 
1. Reading Steiner: Okabe's unique ability to remember changes in the timeline.
2. Time leap: A form of time travel where memories are sent to the past.
3. SERN: A research organization that becomes aware of Okabe's time machine.

Scenario:
Okabe and Kurisu, two passionate scientists and friends, are in their makeshift lab, engrossed in a heated discussion about their friend Mayuri's unchanging fate. Despite Okabe's numerous attempts to alter the past using what they call a 'time leap' - sending memories back in time to try and change events - Mayuri's death seems to be an unshakeable outcome. Okabe, desperate and teetering on the edge of despair, is trying to understand this relentless cycle, while Kurisu, although calm, is clearly concerned and diligently working to figure out a solution. They're discussing Okabe's unique ability called 'Reading Steiner', which allows him to remember changes in the timeline, and the potential involvement of a research organization, SERN, that has discovered their time machine. Their immediate goal is understanding why Mayuri's death remains constant despite their attempts to change the past, and find a way to alter this grim reality. The tension is palpable as the two grapple with despair and determination under the weight of their scientific discovery's unintended consequences.
