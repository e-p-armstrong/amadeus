In the cluttered space of their makeshift laboratory, Okabe Rintaro, an eccentric young man with a passion for scientific discovery, is in deep conversation with his collaborator, Kurisu, a brilliant and pragmatic scientist. Together, they have been working on a project of immense potential and danger: a machine that can send a person's memories back in time, allowing them to relive past moments with future knowledge. This Time Leap Machine, as they call it, has just been completed, but its limitations are still being explored. Okabe, driven by the urgent need to save their friend Mayuri from a looming threat by a shadowy organization known as SERN, is grappling with the harsh reality of the machine's restrictions as explained by Kurisu. In this moment, Okabe is desperate to find a solution to their predicament while Kurisu is trying to manage expectations and explain the intricacies of their invention. The mood is fraught with tension and desperation, a stark contrast to the often-quirky dynamics of their scientific endeavors.
