Okabe, a curious and tenacious "mad scientist", discovers his fellow lab member, Suzuha, secretly examining the satellite. It becomes evident that their relationship is not as simple as it seems when Okabe stumbles upon the shocking revelation that Suzuha is actually John Titor, a character who claims to be a time traveler from the future. Amidst the smoke and sparking wires, Suzuha, panicked and frustrated, admits to being a time traveler and reveals that the satellite is her malfunctioning time machine. As Okabe grapples with these revelations, he is driven to uncover the truth, while Suzuha struggles to fix her time machine and keep her mission a secret from a nefarious scientific organization called SERN.
