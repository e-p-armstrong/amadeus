First, I will identify the key points in this scene. The location is the Radi-Kan building, and the characters present are Okabe and Suzuha. The relationship between the characters is that of fellow lab members, but in this moment, Okabe is uncovering Suzuha's secret identity as John Titor, a supposed time traveler from the future. 

The emotional state of Okabe is shock, confusion, and curiosity as he stumbles upon this revelation. Suzuha, on the other hand, is panicked, frustrated, and resigned, as her time machine has malfunctioned and she has been discovered. 

The significant event leading up to this scene is the satellite crashing into the Radi-Kan building. The scene revolves around Okabe discovering that the satellite is actually a time machine and Suzuha admitting to being a time traveler. 

Steins;Gate-specific terms that need to be defined include John Titor - a character who claims to be a time traveler from the future, and SERN - a malevolent scientific organization. 

Okabe's goal in this scene is to understand the truth about the satellite and Suzuha's true identity. Suzuha's goal is to fix her time machine and possibly escape without revealing too much of her identity and mission. 

The overall mood of the scene is suspenseful, tense, and mysterious. 

Scenario: 

In the rubble of the Radi-Kan building, a satellite lies embedded in the roof. Okabe, a curious and tenacious "mad scientist", discovers his fellow lab member, Suzuha, secretly examining the satellite. It becomes evident that their relationship is not as simple as it seems when Okabe stumbles upon the shocking revelation that Suzuha is actually John Titor, a character who claims to be a time traveler from the future. Amidst the smoke and sparking wires, Suzuha, panicked and frustrated, admits to being a time traveler and reveals that the satellite is her malfunctioning time machine. As Okabe grapples with these revelations, he is driven to uncover the truth, while Suzuha struggles to fix her time machine and keep her mission a secret from a nefarious scientific organization called SERN. The atmosphere is charged with tension and mystery as the two navigate this unexpected crisis.
