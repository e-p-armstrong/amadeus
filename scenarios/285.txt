 
In a secluded area, Okabe and Suzuha are engaged in a tense conversation about time travel and a mysterious mission. They are friends, but their relationship is strained by the heavy topics they are discussing â€” Suzuha's failed mission and the threat posed by a powerful organization, SERN, to their mutual friend, Mayuri. Okabe, who has recently used a device to send his memories back in time to alter future events, is desperate for answers and is pressing Suzuha for information. After their conversation, they return to their shared lab where they are unexpectedly greeted by Mayuri, Daru, and Kurisu. The atmosphere is tense and ominous as Okabe, Suzuha, and Kurisu try to discuss their situation covertly, while Mayuri and Daru remain blissfully unaware of the looming danger.
