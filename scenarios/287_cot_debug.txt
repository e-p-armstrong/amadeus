Brainstorm:
1. This scene probably falls somewhere in the middle of the timeline, after Suzuha reveals her identity as a time traveler and shares knowledge about the future, but before Okabe starts undoing the D-mails. 
2. The characters present are Okabe, Kurisu, Itaru, and Suzuha. 
3. Suzuha is a time traveler from the future, she is somewhat distant and hostile towards Kurisu because of Kurisu's role in future events; Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru are lab members who have been working on time travel technology. 
4. They're probably in their lab, as most of their discussions take place there. 
5. The emotional state is tense, as they're discussing serious future events, with revelations about each character's future selves. 
6. The significant events leading up to this are the development of the time machine and D-mails, and the discovery of their implications. 
7. The scene involves Suzuha revealing future details about Kurisu and Okabe, which shocks them.
8. The special terms are 'SERN', which is a research organization that becomes tyrannical in the future, and 'Rounders', a covert group working for SERN.
9. Every character is trying to grapple with the revelations and understand the implications.
10. The overall mood of the scene is tense and serious.

Scenario: In the close-knit confines of their lab, the unlikely quartet - Okabe, Kurisu, Itaru, and the time-traveler Suzuha - find themselves engrossed in a tense discussion about the future. Each of them has had their lives intertwined with the time travel research they've been conducting, and with Suzuha's revelation of the future, the stakes have never been higher. Okabe, the eccentric scientist, and Kurisu, the brilliant yet modest researcher, find themselves grappling with unexpected revelations about their future selves, as told by Suzuha. Itaru, the computer whiz of the group, is trying to understand the situation, himself a bystander in the revelation. As Suzuha unveils the future, where Kurisu is revered as the pioneer of time leap technology and Okabe is deemed a terrorist, the atmosphere grows thick with shock and disbelief. Each character is trying to comprehend the impact of Suzuha's words, their futures suddenly thrown into uncertainty. The mood of the scene is somber and suspenseful, a stark departure from their usual camaraderie as they grapple with the weight of their destinies.
