 In a shared workspace littered with scientific equipment and a sewing table, Okabe Rintaro, Kurisu, Suzuha, and Itaru gather for a discussion. Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru, friends and fellow scientists, listen intently as Suzuha, a time traveler from the future, explains her understanding of the universe's structure. The atmosphere is charged with curiosity and intrigue as Suzuha uses the metaphor of yarn to illustrate her explanation. She introduces the concept of "Attractor Fields," groups of worldlines that all converge to a single outcome, and "worldlines," different potential timelines that the universe could follow. As they hang on her every word, each character strives to comprehend this complex model and its implications for their understanding of time and space. The scene is a vibrant tableau of intellectual engagement and exploration.
