In the cluttered, somewhat chaotic environment of the Future Gadget Laboratory, a group of friends gathers to discuss an urgent matter that's beyond most people's comprehension — altering the course of time. Okabe, the self-proclaimed 'mad scientist', is grappling with the tragic loop of his childhood friend Mayuri's death, a consequence of their time travel experiments. Kurisu, the actual scientist of the group, is determined to understand the situation, while Suzuha, a mysterious time-traveler, provides crucial information. Itaru, the group's super hacker, watches the discussion unfold, while Mayuri, the subject of their desperate deliberations, seems lost in the complexity of the conversation. The revelation of Okabe's unique ability to remember events across different timelines — a phenomenon they've named 'Reading Steiner' — sparks a glimmer of hope amidst the tense and apprehensive atmosphere. Their objective: to escape the inevitable sequence of events, or 'Attractor Field', in their current timeline and jump to another where Mayuri's death isn't predestined.
