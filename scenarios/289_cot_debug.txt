Brainstorming:

This scene appears to take place in the middle of the story, after the group has discovered the power of their time machine and their tampering with time has led to tragic consequences — specifically, Mayuri's unavoidable death. The characters involved are Okabe, Kurisu, Suzuha, Itaru, and Mayuri, gathered in their usual haunt, the Future Gadget Laboratory.

The relationships here are complicated. Okabe, as the self-proclaimed 'mad scientist', is the one who's been dealing with the emotional burden of his failed attempts to save Mayuri, his childhood friend. Kurisu, who's the actual scientist of the group, is the one who helped improve the time machine and shares a complex relationship with Okabe. Suzuha is a time-traveler from the future who's trying to help them, while Itaru, Okabe's other friend and a super hacker, is more of a spectator in this conversation. 

The emotional state of the characters would be tense, as they grapple with the implications of their actions and the possibility of changing their dire situation. Okabe, in particular, would be desperate and perhaps also hopeful at Suzuha's suggestion.

Steins;Gate-specific terms include 'Attractor Field' and 'Reading Steiner'. The former refers to the concept that certain events are destined to happen in a given timeline, while the latter is Okabe's unique ability to retain memories from different timelines.

The goal of each character in this scene is to understand the situation and find a solution to their problem — saving Mayuri without causing other catastrophic events. The overall mood of the scene would likely be tense and apprehensive, mixed with a faint glimmer of hope.

Scenario:

In the cluttered, somewhat chaotic environment of the Future Gadget Laboratory, a group of friends gathers to discuss an urgent matter that's beyond most people's comprehension — altering the course of time. Okabe, the self-proclaimed 'mad scientist', is grappling with the tragic loop of his childhood friend Mayuri's death, a consequence of their time travel experiments. Kurisu, the actual scientist of the group, is determined to understand the situation, while Suzuha, a mysterious time-traveler, provides crucial information. Itaru, the group's super hacker, watches the discussion unfold, while Mayuri, the subject of their desperate deliberations, seems lost in the complexity of the conversation. The revelation of Okabe's unique ability to remember events across different timelines — a phenomenon they've named 'Reading Steiner' — sparks a glimmer of hope amidst the tense and apprehensive atmosphere. Their objective: to escape the inevitable sequence of events, or 'Attractor Field', in their current timeline and jump to another where Mayuri's death isn't predestined.
