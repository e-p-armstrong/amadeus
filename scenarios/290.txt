Suzuha, the bearer of grim news from the future, is explaining her father's will, which has fueled her decision to time travel. She reveals that her father was a resistance member against SERN, a powerful organization that has been tracking their communications in search of time travel research.

Each member grapples with the revelation, their goal to understand and rectify this dangerous situation.
