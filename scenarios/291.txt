 In a cluttered lab filled with gadgets, four individuals – Okabe, an eccentric self-proclaimed mad scientist; Itaru, a skilled hacker and Okabe's loyal friend; Suzuha, a determined time-traveler; and Kurisu, a genius scientist – grapple with a tense situation. They are discussing the possibility of accessing the protected database of a powerful organization using a rare, vintage computer model. While the group has recently discovered the ability to manipulate time, they must now confront the dangerous consequences of their actions. In this timeline, Okabe remembers obtaining the rare computer, but Itaru does not, creating confusion. Suzuha, determined to fulfill her mission, plans to travel back to 1975 to obtain this computer, while Kurisu contemplates using their time-leap technology to avert the damage done to Suzuha's time machine. Amidst the urgency and tension, each character is driven by their own goal: Okabe seeks a way out of the impending disaster, Daru strives to grasp the situation, Suzuha remains committed to her mission, and Kurisu explores solutions using their time-manipulation technology. The overall mood of the scene is one of high stakes, fraught with the desperate need to avoid a catastrophic future.
