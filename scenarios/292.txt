In a cluttered lab filled with electronics and remnants of countless experiments, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, discusses a dire situation with his friends and fellow researchers, Itaru, Mayuri, Kurisu, and Suzuha. Their relationships are a mishmash of camaraderie, respect, and shared curiosity in the scientific unknown, all under the leadership of the eccentric Okabe. The air is thick with tension and desperation, as they are against the clock, battling the relentless march of time. Their time machine, a miraculous invention that allows them to send memories to the past, is malfunctioned, and Mayuri is destined to die in less than two hours if nothing changes. Okabe, driven by a desperate determination, plans to "leap" back in time, giving them a chance to repair the machine and alter Mayuri's fate. This is a high-stakes race against time, with an undercurrent of sadness and fear, as they grapple with the harsh realities of their situation.
