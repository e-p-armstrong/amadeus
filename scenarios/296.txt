In a dimly lit, makeshift research facility, Okabe, Kurisu and Suzuha are engaged in a tense discussion. Okabe and Kurisu, both passionate researchers, are joined by Suzuha, a time-traveler from the future, in their relentless pursuit of scientific exploration. Okabe, burdened with the task of saving his friend Mayuri, is anxiously searching online for information about a unique pin. Kurisu, on the other hand, is worried about their missing companion, Daru. Unbeknownst to them, Suzuha has a revelation to share: she reveals a strange object, a divergence meter, that measures shifts in time, and credits its creation to Okabe himself. As they grapple with this startling revelation, the room is filled with a mixture of surprise, confusion, and apprehension.
