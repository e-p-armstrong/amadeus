 Okabe and Suzuha are in a bustling, sunlit city street, their search for clues about Suzuha's elusive father seemingly hitting a dead end. Okabe, a determined yet frustrated physicist, has just finished questioning a local shop owner, trying to find any leads related to a distinctive pin that might point to Suzuha's father. Suzuha, a time-traveller from a dystopian future, watches from a distance, nursing a drink and playing the role of a spectator rather than an active participant in the search. The search, which involves questioning non-native Japanese speakers and dealing with language barriers, has proven to be challenging and fruitless so far. As the sun beats down on them, Okabe wrestles with his own feelings of inadequacy and Suzuha contemplates the possibility of never meeting her father, setting a somber and reflective tone to the scene.
