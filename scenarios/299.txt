 In the bustling city streets, Okabe, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist", confronts Suzuha, a fellow lab member and friend, about her apparent resignation to a bleak fate. The relationship between the two is strained, with Okabe driven to the brink by the weight of his memories of different timelines, and Suzuha feeling overwhelmed and hopeless. Okabe, who alone remembers the different timelines due to his unique ability, is also burdened by the impending doom of their friend Mayuri. Amidst this heated confrontation, they are interrupted by Mayuri, another lab member, who is handing out leaflets at a nearby station to aid in the search for Suzuha's father - a search with unknown but potentially dire consequences. In this tense scene, Okabe is determined to save both Mayuri and Suzuha, Suzuha grapples with her fate, and Mayuri, oblivious to her own danger, works earnestly to help her friends.
