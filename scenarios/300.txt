 The scene takes place on a bustling city street where Okabe, Mayuri, and Suzuha are handing out leaflets for an unknown cause, resulting in an unexpected encounter with a stern-faced policeman. Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is reluctantly participating in the event organized by the well-meaning yet naive Mayuri, while Suzuha, a straightforward and pragmatic woman, observes with skepticism. Their attempt to get the public's attention results in an hour-long police interrogation, which leaves them exhausted but undeterred. After their release, they return to their laboratory where they are welcomed by Kurisu, a genius scientist with a sharp tongue. Okabe and Kurisu share a complex relationship, filled with playful banter and intellectual rivalry, which is evident when they discuss a mysterious "lifter," a vital component of their time-travel device. While Okabe aims to keep the team's spirits high and continue with their plans, Kurisu is focused on progressing their research. The overall mood of the scene is a blend of light-hearted humor and underlying tension, as they balance their audacious endeavors with the looming threat of getting caught.
