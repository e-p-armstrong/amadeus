In the bustling lab of a group of young, aspiring scientists, Okabe, Suzuha, and Kurisu find themselves embroiled in a debate. The trio, despite their constant playful bickering, share a common goal: to unravel the mysteries of the time machine they've inadvertently created from a microwave. Okabe, the self-proclaimed "mad scientist", is trying to maintain a semblance of control over the chaotic situation, while Kurisu, the actual genius, struggles to balance her scientific curiosity with her concerns over the ethics of their discovery. Suzuha, on the other hand, keeps her motivations hidden under a veil of aloofness. As they navigate their shared mission, the conversation shifts to the "lifter", a crucial part of their time machine that they're yet to fully understand. Okabe, in his usual eccentric fashion, attempts to lighten the mood while simultaneously driving the conversation towards their imminent task: repairing the time machine. The overall mood is tense yet lighthearted, as they grapple with the enormity of their discovery while keeping their camaraderie intact.
