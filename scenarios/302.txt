 On a fruitless search for a mysterious pin, Okabe and Suzuha, a time-traveler from a dystopian future, are traversing the city, growing more despondent with each passing hour. Meanwhile, at their makeshift lab, Itaru, a close friend and fellow scientist, is laboring over the repair of their damaged equipment. The relationship between the characters is strained - they are friends and collaborators, but the weight of their discovery of time travel and its consequences casts a heavy shadow over them. Okabe, attempting to keep his spirits up, engages Suzuha in a conversation about his future self, hoping to get a better understanding of the man he is supposed to become. In this gloomy, desperate scene, each character is striving to fix the situation: Okabe and Suzuha in their search, Itaru with his repairs, and all of them, in their own way, trying to grapple with the reality of the dystopian future they have inadvertently set in motion.
