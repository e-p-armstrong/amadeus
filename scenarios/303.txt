 On the hot rooftop of a building, Okabe, a scientist, is in a serious conversation with Suzuha, his fellow researcher and friend. Also present are their friends Mayuri and Daru, who are discussing the time machine in the background. The mood is tense as Suzuha reveals the grim future to Okabe, where he and Mayuri are killed, and their brilliant friend Kurisu becomes a slave to SERN - an ominous scientific research organization. Prior to this, they've been working on a time machine in an attempt to alter the future, and now, the revelation has intensified their determination. The goal of Okabe and Suzuha in this scene is to find a way to prevent this future, specifically by locating a vintage computer known as the IBN 5100, necessary to achieve their mission.
