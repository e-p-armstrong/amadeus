Firstly, I will identify the location of the scene, which is on the roof of a building. The characters present are Okabe, Suzuha, Daru, and Mayuri. Their relationships are that of friends and fellow researchers. The emotional and mental states of the characters are a mix of worry, determination, and camaraderie, particularly between Okabe and Suzuha, as they discuss the grim future. Leading up to the scene, they have been trying to alter the future using a time machine. The significant event happening during the scene is Suzuha revealing the future to Okabe. The special terms needing explanation are SERN (a scientific research organization) and IBN 5100 (a sought-after vintage computer). The characters' goals are to change the future and save their friends. The overall mood of the scene is serious and tense.

Scenario: On the hot rooftop of a building, Okabe, a scientist, is in a serious conversation with Suzuha, his fellow researcher and friend. Also present are their friends Mayuri and Daru, who are discussing the time machine in the background. The mood is tense as Suzuha reveals the grim future to Okabe, where he and Mayuri are killed, and their brilliant friend Kurisu becomes a slave to SERN - an ominous scientific research organization. Prior to this, they've been working on a time machine in an attempt to alter the future, and now, the revelation has intensified their determination. The goal of Okabe and Suzuha in this scene is to find a way to prevent this future, specifically by locating a vintage computer known as the IBN 5100, necessary to achieve their mission.
