In the familiar surroundings of their shared laboratory, friends and colleagues Okabe and Mayuri find themselves deep in a discussion about their mutual friend, Suzuha's, upcoming time-travel to 1975. Both are well aware of the risks associated with time travel, a concept once thought to be fiction but has now become a dangerous reality for them. As Mayuri expresses her worries and ponders whether she should accompany Suzuha, Okabe is lost in his own thoughts, deeply curious about the time machine and the potential risks it holds. The conversation continues with a mix of apprehension and intrigue as they discuss the time machine's model number, a detail that could hold the key to its functionality and safety.

The atmosphere is charged with a blend of tension, curiosity, and a shared sense of responsibility as they navigate the delicate balance between scientific curiosity and the wellbeing of their friend.
