 On a rooftop overlooking a picturesque sunset, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, shares a moment with Mayuri, an optimistically spirited girl, and Suzuha, a time traveler from a dystopian future. Mayuri excitedly runs to inspect the time machine that their friend Daru, an adept hacker and technician, is working on. Suzuha, on the other hand, stands beside Okabe, her gaze focused on the horizon, her mind seemingly full of thoughts. As the orange glow of the setting sun stretches their shadows, Suzuha opens up about her experiences in the peaceful present, contrasting it with her war-torn future. She aims to express her newfound appreciation for their camaraderie, while Okabe listens, trying to make sense of her complex emotions. The scene is a blend of melancholy and hope, reflective of Suzuha's gratitude and her longing for the vibrancy of life she has found in this era.
