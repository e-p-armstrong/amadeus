Inside the cluttered Future Gadget Laboratory, Okabe Rintaro, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is engaged in a deep conversation with Suzuha, a time-traveler from a dystopian future. Okabe and Suzuha share a camaraderie, both dedicated to the cause of changing the future. Suzuha, filled with a quiet sadness and resolve, is preparing for her mission to retrieve a rare computer, the 'IBN 5100', which is integral to their plan. Meanwhile, Okabe grapples with the weight of their mission, trying to maintain a sense of normalcy despite the heavy task at hand. Kurisu, a genius scientist and an ally, emerges from the development room, oblivious to the tense phone call Okabe receives. The overall mood is a blend of melancholy and tension, as Suzuha prepares to depart for her mission, Okabe attempts to reassure her, and an unexpected phone call from an unknown foreigner throws Okabe into alertness, invoking fear of the powerful organization, 'SERN', they are trying to outwit.
