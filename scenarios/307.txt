 In the lab, Okabe, Suzuha, and Kurisu gather around the recently completed time leap machine, a device that sends memories to the past. Okabe, frustrated by his fruitless search for a person named Barrel Titor, is eager to retry the encounter using the machine. Kurisu, the machine's primary developer, is satisfied with her work but puzzled by Okabe's unique ability, known as the Reading Steiner, that allows him to remember different timelines. Suzuha, a time-traveller fascinated by this new form of time travel, discusses theories about memory and consciousness. As they delve into these complex subjects, the atmosphere is intense. Okabe's goal is to use the machine to change his unsuccessful search, Kurisu seeks to understand the Reading Steiner, and Suzuha tries to comprehend the concept of time leaping. The overall mood is tense and thought-provoking as the characters grapple with their understanding of time, memory, and consciousness.
