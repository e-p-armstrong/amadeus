In the fading light of a sunset, four friends gather around an unusual object - a crashed satellite that they've discovered is actually a time machine. Okabe, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist," observes from a distance with his childhood friend, Mayuri, as their hacker friend, Daru, and their new companion, Suzuha, a time traveler from the future, discuss the machine. They're all in relatively jovial moods, with Mayuri showing exuberant curiosity about the time machine and expressing her worry and support for Suzuha's upcoming journey to 1975. Okabe, though more reserved, engages in the conversation, maintaining a sense of normalcy despite the extraordinary circumstances. As they bask in the strange warmth of the moment, they are all navigating the weighty implications of time travel, caught between the excitement of the unknown and the fear of its potential dangers.
