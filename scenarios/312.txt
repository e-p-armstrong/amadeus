 On a clear day, under a vast blue sky, Okabe, Mayuri, Daru, and Kurisu stand in the shadow of a partially damaged building, Radi-Kan, where a time machine is lodged. Suzuha, the time-traveler from the future, is preparing to journey to the past, her bike secured to the exterior of the machine. Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, wrestles with mixed feelings — melancholy, regret, and a sense of helplessness — as he watches Suzuha ready herself to leave. The others, Mayuri, Daru, and Kurisu, despite their own feelings, offer words of encouragement to Suzuha, trying to lighten the mood. They even suggest making duplicates of a pin — a memento from Suzuha's father — to serve as a symbol for their group. In this bittersweet setting, each character is grappling with the reality of Suzuha's impending departure, their emotions as complex and interwoven as the timelines they've been navigating.
