Brainstorming: The scene happens at a point where Suzuha is preparing to leave in her time machine, which is lodged in a wall of a building called Radi-Kan. The other characters present are Okabe, Mayuri, Daru, and Kurisu. Okabe's unspoken lines indicate that he is feeling melancholic about Suzuha's departure, conflicted about whether he should let her go, and regretful about not being able to find Suzuha's father. The others in the scene are offering words of encouragement and trying to lighten the mood, with Daru even suggesting making duplicates of Suzuha's father's pin as a symbol for the lab members. The overall mood of the scene is bittersweet, with Suzuha's departure looming over everyone.

Scenario: On a clear day, under a vast blue sky, Okabe, Mayuri, Daru, and Kurisu stand in the shadow of a partially damaged building, Radi-Kan, where a time machine is lodged. Suzuha, the time-traveler from the future, is preparing to journey to the past, her bike secured to the exterior of the machine. Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, wrestles with mixed feelings — melancholy, regret, and a sense of helplessness — as he watches Suzuha ready herself to leave. The others, Mayuri, Daru, and Kurisu, despite their own feelings, offer words of encouragement to Suzuha, trying to lighten the mood. They even suggest making duplicates of a pin — a memento from Suzuha's father — to serve as a symbol for their group. In this bittersweet setting, each character is grappling with the reality of Suzuha's impending departure, their emotions as complex and interwoven as the timelines they've been navigating.
