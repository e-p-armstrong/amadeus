In an empty event hall, a group of friends—Okabe, Mayuri, Suzuha, Itaru, and Kurisu—are gathered in anticipation of an announcement from Mayuri. These friends, who have been navigating the complexities of time travel, share strong bonds and a shared sense of purpose. The air is thick with tension and curiosity as Mayuri, Okabe's cheerful childhood friend, prepares to reveal a theory she believes will change their understanding of their fellow team member, Suzuha. Amidst their experiments with a time machine—a device that allows them to send messages to the past—this revelation promises to add another layer of complexity to their situation. As Mayuri steps up to share her theory about Suzuha's mysterious past, the others brace themselves for the impact of her words, their emotions teetering between apprehension and eager curiosity.
