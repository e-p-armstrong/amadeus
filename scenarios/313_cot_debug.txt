Scenario:
In an empty event hall, a group of friends—Okabe, Mayuri, Suzuha, Itaru, and Kurisu—are gathered in anticipation of an announcement from Mayuri. These friends, who have been navigating the complexities of time travel, share strong bonds and a shared sense of purpose. The air is thick with tension and curiosity as Mayuri, Okabe's cheerful childhood friend, prepares to reveal a theory she believes will change their understanding of their fellow team member, Suzuha.
