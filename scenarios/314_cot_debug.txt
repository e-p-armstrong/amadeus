Brainstorming: 

The scene is set in the lab where Okabe, Mayuri, Kurisu, Itaru, and Suzuha are present. They are discussing their relationships, past events, and making deductions about Itaru's possible future identity. Okabe is in a conflicted state, aware of the impending danger to Mayuri, yet he has to remain silent about it. Mayuri, oblivious to her fate, is trying to fit the pieces of the puzzle about Suzuha's father, while Kurisu supports her theory. Itaru, initially startled by the conversation, begins to consider the possibility he might be Suzuha's father. Suzuha is mixed with curiosity and skepticism about the revelations. The PhoneWave is a time machine they had created, D-Mail is a message sent to the past, and Reading Steiner is Okabe's ability to remember the original timeline after changes have been made.

Scenario:

In their laboratory, a group of friends, Okabe, Mayuri, Kurisu, Itaru, and Suzuha, gather for a discussion. Okabe, a scientist with a unique ability to remember original timelines, is burdened with the knowledge of his friend Mayuri's impending death. Unaware of her fate, Mayuri, along with Kurisu, is trying to connect the dots and uncover the identity of Suzuha's father. Their hypothesis implicates their friend, Itaru, who, despite his initial shock, starts to consider the possibility. Amidst the bittersweet revelations, the group discusses the time machine they had built, called the PhoneWave, and its function to send messages, known as D-Mails, back in time. The objective of the scene is for each character to process the unfolding revelations, with Okabe battling his inner turmoil, Mayuri and Kurisu trying to solve the mystery, and Itaru digesting the potential twist in his life's story. The overall mood of the scene is intense, filled with anticipation and a sense of impending doom.
