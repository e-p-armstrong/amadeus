 In a familiar, casual setting - likely their shared lab space - Okabe, Suzuha, Mayuri, Kurisu, and Itaru (Daru) are engaged in a playful word game. They are all close friends, though Okabe and Kurisu share a deeper understanding despite their occasional squabbles. Amidst this light-hearted gathering, a shocking revelation emerges - Suzuha, a friend from an uncertain future, is Itaru's daughter. The playful banter quickly gives way to disbelief and tension as Itaru struggles to process this new information. Mayuri tries to lighten the mood, Okabe attempts to navigate this new reality, Kurisu offers logical explanations, while Suzuha seeks her father's understanding and support for her mission. This emotional rollercoaster of a scene balances a playful camaraderie with the strain of a sudden, life-altering revelation.
