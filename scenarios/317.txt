 In the haphazard, cluttered confines of the Future Gadget Laboratory, friends and lab members Okabe, Daru, Kurisu, and Mayuri are engaged in a tense discussion. They are anxiously awaiting the results of a time-traveling mission undertaken by their mutual friend Suzuha, who is also the adult daughter of the unsuspecting Daru. The emotional atmosphere is a strange cocktail of anticipation, anxiety, and the surreal, as they grapple with the peculiarities of time travel, all while trying to maintain a sense of normalcy. However, their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of their landlord Tennouji, who is unaware of their activities and is searching for Suzuha, his missing employee. As they attempt to navigate this interruption, they are also dealing with the uncertainty of whether their actions will have the intended effect on the timeline, commonly referred to as the "attractor field" in their time travel theories.
