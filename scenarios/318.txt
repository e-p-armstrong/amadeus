In their makeshift lab, friends and amateur scientists Okabe, Mayuri, and Itaru (also known as Daru) are in the midst of a critical discussion with their landlord, Tennouji, also known as Mr. Braun. They've been working together on experimental time-travel, yet Tennouji remains unaware of their secret activities. Amid their conversation, a shocking revelation comes to light: their friend, Suzuha, who had time-traveled to the past under the alias 'Hashida Suzu', had failed a mission critical to their work and has now passed away. The friends learn this through a letter left behind by Suzuha, delivered by a clueless Tennouji. The goal of each character is to process the shocking news; Okabe and his friends are trying to understand Suzuha's failure and its implications, while Tennouji is trying to comprehend their strange reaction. The overall mood of the scene is somber and tense, with a palpable sense of loss and regret.
