 Inside a nondescript room filled with various technological gadgets and equipment, three friends, Okabe, Daru, and Kurisu, stand in a heated discussion. Okabe, the most animated among them, is passionately questioning Daru, a talented hacker and the one who recently attempted to fix their experimental time machine. Kurisu, a calm and composed scientist, tries to mediate the escalating tension. The atmosphere is thick with regret and frustration, as their recent attempt to change the past with their time machine has tragically backfired and resulted in Daru's daughter losing 24 years of her life. As the argument unfolds, Okabe seeks answers, Daru grapples with guilt, and Kurisu strives to maintain peace, all while the mood remains somber and intense."
