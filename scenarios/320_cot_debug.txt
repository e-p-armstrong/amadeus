Brainstorm:
1. Location and characters: The scene takes place in a lab with Okabe, Kurisu, and Mayuri present. The lab is presumably where they conduct their scientific experiments.
2. Relationships: Okabe, Kurisu, and Mayuri are colleagues and friends. Okabe and Kurisu are the main scientists, while Mayuri is more of a supportive friend. Okabe and Kurisu share a deeper understanding due to their shared work.
3. Emotional states: Okabe is determined but also conflicted, and Kurisu is fearful and inquisitive. Mayuri is worried and emotional.
4. Significant events: Okabe has discovered a way to send messages back in time and is considering using this technology to alter past events to prevent a perceived future catastrophe. However, this decision isn't easy, as it will erase certain memories and relationships.
5. Goals: Okabe's goal is to make the difficult decision of sending a message to the past. Kurisu wants answers about Okabe's intentions. Mayuri is worried about losing memories and wants to stop Okabe.
6. Mood: The overall mood is tense and melancholic, with a sense of impending decision hanging in the air.
7. This seems to be one continuous scene.

Special Terms: D-Mail (a message sent to the past), PhoneWave (the device used to send D-Mails)

Scenario: In a lab filled with tension, Okabe, Kurisu, and Mayuri grapple with a crucial decision. As scientists and close friends, Okabe and Kurisu have pushed the boundaries of time itself, creating a device, dubbed the "PhoneWave," capable of sending messages, or "D-Mails," back in time. Now, Okabe stands on the precipice of using this technology to change past events, driven by a desperate need to avert a future disaster. However, the fear of erasing cherished memories and relationships looms heavy in the air, evidenced by Kurisu's fearful inquiries and Mayuri's tearful objections. As Okabe wrestles with his decision, the lab echoes with the melancholy of potential loss and the relentless ticking of time.
