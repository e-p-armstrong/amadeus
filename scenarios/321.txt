 

In a cluttered lab, Okabe, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Daru are present, with Okabe recovering from the effects of a time-altering device and the others oblivious to the world-altering event that just took place. Okabe, as the leader and visionary of their scientific endeavors, shares a complex bond of friendship and shared secrets with the rest of the group. In the aftermath of his reality-warping action, Okabe is gripped by anxiety and uncertainty, while the others remain unaware and relaxed. Prior to this, Okabe had used a device capable of sending messages to the past - a desperate attempt to alter the timeline and prevent a tragedy. His immediate goal now is to determine whether his attempt to change the past has been successful, while the others continue with their routine activities, unaware of Okabe's internal struggle. The overall mood is tense and suspenseful, with Okabe's fear and desperation contrasting sharply with the comfortable normalcy of his friends' actions.
