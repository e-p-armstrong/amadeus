 In their lab nestled amidst the electronic shops of Akihabara, Okabe, Mayuri, Kurisu, and Daru gather after a day of scientific endeavours. The labâ€™s atmosphere is palpable with a mix of anxiety and relief, predominantly radiating from Okabe, the team's eccentric leader who, with his friends, has been experimenting with time travel. The events leading up to this scene involves Okabe altering the course of events to prevent a hostile raid on their lab, thereby ensuring the safety of his childhood friend, Mayuri. As they wake from a nap, Okabe instructs Mayuri and Kurisu, a genius scientist who joined their team, to go home, offering to accompany them in the late hours. The scene's mood is tense yet hopeful as Okabe, vigilant and cautious, seeks to protect his friends following a successfully averted crisis.
