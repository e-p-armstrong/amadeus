 In the familiar setting of their shared laboratory, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, and Mayuri, his childhood friend, try to return to their everyday life after the tumultuous events of their recent past. Okabe, having just saved both Mayuri and another friend from the clutches of death using a time machine, is trying to pretend everything is normal, but Mayuri, who is more perceptive than she lets on, notices his strange behavior. Meanwhile, Tennouji, the owner of a nearby electronics shop and an unknowing pawn of a powerful organization, engages in casual conversation with Okabe, offering him a job and expressing confusion about the name of a former employee, Suzuha, a key figure in Okabe's recent struggles. Okabe, shocked that Tennouji doesn't remember Suzuha, tries to keep his composure and maintain the facade of normalcy. In this scene, Okabe is attempting to return to his pre-adventure life, while Mayuri, concerned for her friend, tries to understand what's troubling him, and Tennouji unknowingly stirs up memories of their recent time-traveling escapades. The overall mood of the scene is one of uneasy calm, as Okabe and Mayuri attempt to reclaim their ordinary lives in the aftermath of extraordinary events.
