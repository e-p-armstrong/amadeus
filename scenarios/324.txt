Oblivious to his worries, Mayuri greets Okabe with her usual carefree spirit, excited about their day ahead. Their conversation revolves around a device Okabe received, which can measure variations in reality, or "worldlines" - a precautionary measure due to recent dangerous events. Okabeâ€™s fear for Mayuri's safety is palpable, and he suggests she keep a low profile, but his concerns fall on deaf ears as Mayuri wanders off, drawn to a nearby stand.

As Okabe busies himself with searching for a vital piece of equipment needed to ensure their safety, Kurisu watches, noting Okabe's unusual protectiveness towards Mayuri. The scene is filled with underlying tension, as the simple facade of their everyday life conceals Okabe's persistent worry for their safety.
