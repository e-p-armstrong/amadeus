Inside a laboratory, Okabe, the self-proclaimed mad scientist, Kurisu, the genius scientist, Mayuri, Okabe's innocent childhood friend, and Suzuha, the informative time-traveler, engage in conversation. Okabe and Kurisu share a complicated bond, marked by friendly rivalry and underlying tension, while Mayuri brings a touch of light-heartedness to the group. After experiencing the devastating failure to save Mayuri in a previous timeline, Okabe grapples with a sense of nostalgia and loneliness, trying to keep the mood light. The scene, however, takes a serious turn when Suzuha explains about the concept of worldlines and divergence - a measure of difference from the original timeline - and reveals that reaching 1% divergence could change their fate. As they delve into the complexities of time travel, Okabe tries to hold onto the familiar, Kurisu seeks clarity, Mayuri provides cheer, and Suzuha guides them towards their goal. The scene, initially marked by cheerful banter, gradually descends into a sobering discussion about their daunting mission.
