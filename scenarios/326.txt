In the development room, a space filled with the chaotic clutter of scientific research, Okabe and Kurisu are present, their anxiety palpable. They are friends and fellow scientists, having bonded deeply over their shared work on time travel. Okabe, a man gripped by fear and anxiety, silently prays that his worst fears won't materialize, while Kurisu, a genius scientist, questions Okabe's sudden decision to experiment with the Time Leap Machine â€” a device they've invented that can send memories back in time. The tension escalates when the door slams open and a group of hostile individuals, the "Rounders", known for their pursuit of the lab's research, burst in aiming guns at the duo. Okabe's desperate goal is to protect his friends and possibly use the Time Leap Machine to escape, while Kurisu seeks to understand what's happening, their objectives overshadowed by the overwhelming threat of the "Rounders". The scene is a bitter struggle, filled with tension, fear, and desperation.
