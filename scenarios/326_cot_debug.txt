Brainstorm:
1. The scene happens in the development room, the place where the Time Leap Machine is located. The characters present are Okabe, Kurisu, and the "Rounders" who burst into the room.
2. Okabe and Kurisu are friends and fellow scientists, working together on time travel research. The "Rounders" are a hostile force.
3. Okabe is feeling anxious and fearful, praying that his worst fears of an attack won't come true. Kurisu is curious and concerned about why Okabe wants to experiment with the Time Leap Machine despite earlier saying they wouldn't.
4. They have recently developed the Time Leap Machine, a device that can send memories back in time. Okabe is worried about a potential attack from the "Rounders", a group of people who have targeted them for their research before. This fear is realized when the "Rounders" burst into the lab.
5. Okabe's goal is to protect his friends and possibly use the Time Leap Machine to escape this situation. Kurisu's goal is to understand Okabe's actions and intentions. The "Rounders" goal is to seize control of the lab and its research.
6. The overall mood of the scene is tense and fearful.

Scenario:
In the development room, a space filled with the chaotic clutter of scientific research, Okabe and Kurisu are present, their anxiety palpable. They are friends and fellow scientists, having bonded deeply over their shared work on time travel. Okabe, a man gripped by fear and anxiety, silently prays that his worst fears won't materialize, while Kurisu, a genius scientist, questions Okabe's sudden decision to experiment with the Time Leap Machine â€” a device they've invented that can send memories back in time. The tension escalates when the door slams open and a group of hostile individuals, the "Rounders", known for their pursuit of the lab's research, burst in aiming guns at the duo. Okabe's desperate goal is to protect his friends and possibly use the Time Leap Machine to escape, while Kurisu seeks to understand what's happening, their objectives overshadowed by the overwhelming threat of the "Rounders". The scene is a bitter struggle, filled with tension, fear, and desperation.
