Scenario: On a bench in front of their scientific lab, Okabe and Kurisu, two friends and fellow scientists, sit in the quiet night. Their relationship, forged through shared experiences and experiments in time travel, is now marked with a somber tone. Okabe, usually eccentric, now appears weary and desperate, having repeatedly time-traveled — or "time-leaped", as they call it — to prevent a dear friend's death, yet failing each time. Kurisu, always the more grounded of the two, listens as Okabe speaks of his futile attempts to change the future, his words alluding to a mysterious device known as the IBN 5100, and an ominous organization referred to as SERN. Okabe, in his desperation, seeks Kurisu's help in deciphering the puzzle that is time, hoping to alter their current reality — a "worldline" where tragedy befalls — while Kurisu strives to understand and assist, the weight of the situation pressing down on them both.
