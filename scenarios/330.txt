 In the confines of a cluttered lab, Okabe finds himself engaged in a tense conversation with Kurisu, a brilliant scientist who is nearing the completion of a device capable of sending memories to the past, known as the Time Leap Machine. Their relationship is a complex dance of mutual respect and frequent disagreements, a dynamic that's clearly displayed in their heated exchange. Okabe is under immense pressure, carrying the weight of a decision to undo the effects of the certain messages, known as D-Mails, that have been sent to the past to alter the course of events. He's wrestling with how to cancel these D-Mails, particularly those that have triggered significant changes in the timeline â€” a phenomena only he can remember due to his unique ability called Reading Steiner. The mood is serious and fraught with tension, as Okabe struggles to find a way to return to the original timeline, while Kurisu, seemingly irritated, focuses on completing her task.
