 Okabe finds himself in Faris's apartment, a quiet sanctuary contrasting the bustling city outside. Faris, a vibrant, often lively friend and collaborator in Okabe's time travel experiments, is visibly upset, sitting on the sofa, hugging her knees. Okabe is in a rush, anxious to discuss a critical matter regarding a message sent to the past using their homemade time machine. Prior to this, Faris has suffered a loss in a championship, leaving her despondent and unresponsive. Despite her distress, Okabe must get her to remember the message she sent, an action that, unbeknownst to her, altered the present. The atmosphere in the room is thick with tension and melancholy, as Okabe struggles to break through Faris's sorrow while grappling with the urgency of their situation.
