In a private setting, a close encounter unfolds between Faris, a playful and cat-obsessed girl, and Okabe, a man known for his eccentric and dramatic personality. Their relationship, forged through shared experiences, is tested as Faris clings to Okabe, her desperation palpable. Faris is in a state of distress, grappling with fragmented memories of using a 'time machine', a concept referring to a method of manipulating past events. The tension escalates as Okabe tries to reconcile Faris's claims of physical time travel with his understanding that she has only sent a 'D-Mail' - a message to the past. As Faris grapples with her overwhelming headache and emerging memories, she implores Okabe to let her win a match, believing it may unlock her full recollection. Okabe, meanwhile, struggles with confusion and concern, trying to discern what is really happening to Faris and how he can help. The mood of the scene is fraught with tension and uncertainty, underpinned by a sense of desperation and fear.
