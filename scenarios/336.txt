In the midst of a bustling crowd, Okabe Rintaro finds himself in a heated argument with Faris, an eccentric girl known for her catlike mannerisms and competitive spirit. They share a complicated friendship, often clashing due to Okabe's serious demeanor and Faris's playful nature. Faris, usually light-hearted, is visibly upset and defensive, reacting strongly to Okabe's statement about her potential loss in an upcoming match. Okabe, on the other hand, is desperate and frustrated, trying to convince Faris to listen to him about something crucial, something that he insists is a matter of life or death for their friend Mayuri. The sudden appearance of 4â„ƒ, a flamboyant and antagonistic figure, adds more tension to the scene and threatens to overshadow Okabe's desperate plea. Okabe's main goal is to persuade Faris to listen to him about a way to change past events, known as a "D-Mail", while Faris, feeling attacked, stubbornly refuses to hear him out. The overall mood of the scene is tense and frantic, with a sense of urgency and conflict pervading the air.
