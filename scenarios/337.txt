 In a public space, littered with promotional posters, Faris, Okabe, and 4℃ are in the midst of a heated disagreement. Faris, a quirky individual with an eccentric way of speaking, is trying to enter a hall but is stopped by Okabe, a man who appears desperate to get Faris to listen to him. Meanwhile, 4℃, a self-proclaimed "black nobleman of the RaiNet realm," interjects, creating further tension. The atmosphere is tense, filled with frustration, desperation, and absurdity, as each character tries to assert their own agenda: Faris wants to break away, Okabe pleads for understanding, and 4℃ attempts to assert his authority.
