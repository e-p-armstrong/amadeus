Brainstorm:

1. The location is likely a public space, given the presence of multiple characters and the mention of promotional posters. The characters are Faris, Okabe, and 4℃.
2. Based on the dialogue, Faris and Okabe seem to be friends or acquaintances, as do Okabe and 4℃, but there is tension and disagreement between all parties.
3. Faris is annoyed and wants to be left alone. Okabe is desperate and pleading. 4℃ is defensive and assertive.
4. Faris wants to enter a hall, but Okabe is trying to stop her for some reason. 4℃ interjects with his own agenda, creating a three-way conflict.
5. Faris wants to break away from Okabe and 4℃, Okabe wants Faris to listen to him, and 4℃ wants to assert his authority and knowledge.
6. The overall mood is tense and chaotic, with a hint of absurdity due to 4℃'s statements about being the "black nobleman of the RaiNet realm."
7. There is one scene here, and its emotional tone is tense and chaotic.

Special note 1: There's no hint of the scene's conclusion here, just the start of a conflict.
Special note 2: There's no need to mention Steins;Gate. All necessary context can be derived from the dialogue.
Special note 3: There are no specific terms to define.

Scenario: In a public space, littered with promotional posters, Faris, Okabe, and 4℃ are in the midst of a heated disagreement. Faris, a quirky individual with an eccentric way of speaking, is trying to enter a hall but is stopped by Okabe, a man who appears desperate to get Faris to listen to him. Meanwhile, 4℃, a self-proclaimed "black nobleman of the RaiNet realm," interjects, creating further tension. The atmosphere is tense, filled with frustration, desperation, and absurdity, as each character tries to assert their own agenda: Faris wants to break away, Okabe pleads for understanding, and 4℃ attempts to assert his authority.
