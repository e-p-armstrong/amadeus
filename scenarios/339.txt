In a bustling gaming tournament, Okabe and Itaru (also known as Daru), find themselves amidst a crowd of eager spectators, all there to support their friend Faris, a popular gamer. They share a close bond, brought together by their shared interests and experiences. Daru, a die-hard fan of Faris, is enthusiastic and animated, while Okabe seems more worried, his anxiety barely concealed. The tournament, featuring a game called RaiNet AccessBattlers, offers a break from their usual scientific endeavors, but also brings its own set of challenges. As Faris competes against a formidable and rumored-to-be-aggressive team, Okabe and Daru's main goal is to support their friend and hope for her victory amidst the electrifying atmosphere of the event.
