Earlier, there had been an issue with the game, an interference that Okabe managed to clear, but Faris' performance remains subpar. The crowd starts to murmur as 4℃ accuses Faris of using mind-reading abilities to cheat, an accusation that leaves Okabe baffled and concerned. As the tension mounts, Okabe is eager to win the match and understand what's troubling Faris, while 4℃ relishes in the chaos he's created, eagerly aiming for victory and Faris' downfall. The atmosphere is a blend of anxiety, anticipation, and hostility, as the match and the drama surrounding it continue to unfold.
