Scenario:

In the high-stakes world of a popular online game, friends and lab partners Okabe and Faris find themselves embroiled in a tense match against the antagonistic player, 4℃. Despite their shared history and rapport, Faris is uncharacteristically silent and distant, causing Okabe to worry. Earlier, there had been an issue with the game, an interference that Okabe managed to clear, but Faris' performance remains subpar. The crowd starts to murmur as 4℃ accuses Faris of using mind-reading abilities to cheat, an accusation that leaves Okabe baffled and concerned. As the tension mounts, Okabe is eager to win the match and understand what's troubling Faris, while 4℃ relishes in the chaos he's created, eagerly aiming for victory and Faris' downfall. The atmosphere is a blend of anxiety, anticipation, and hostility, as the match and the drama surrounding it continue to unfold.
