 

Atop a city overpass, Okabe, a scientist obsessed with fixing a fractured reality, confronts his friend and lab member, Faris, an eccentric gamer. They share a complex relationship, marked by Okabe's seriousness and Faris's whimsy. Okabe is desperate to glean the contents of a message Faris once sent to the past, which altered their reality - a message she does not remember. Prior to this, Faris had promised Okabe that she would remember the message if she won a gaming tournament, which she now claims to have been a joke. As Okabe fervently seeks the truth and Faris playfully deflects, the atmosphere between them is fraught with tension and uncertainty, underpinned by Faris's characteristic levity.
