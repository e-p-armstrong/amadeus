 Okabe and Faris, two members of the Future Gadget Laboratory, are hiding in a ramen shop in Akihabara while being pursued by a group known as the Viral Attackers. Having previously been in a world where Akihabara was a hub for otaku culture and this ramen shop was a maid café, Okabe is confused and exhausted, both from the chase and the discrepancies he's noticing. Faris, on the other hand, is her usual cheerful self, using her catlike speech and mannerisms while sharing her disappointment about her father's decision to not open a maid café. Okabe, trying to grapple with the changes in his reality and ensure their safety, sends an SOS message to their friend, Daru. The atmosphere is tense and charged with the danger of their pursuers and the confusion of a changed world.
