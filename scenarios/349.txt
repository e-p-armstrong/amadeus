In the dimly lit confines of a cluttered storehouse, Okabe, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist," and Faris, a lively and anime-loving young woman, engage in a seemingly casual conversation. Their friendship, rooted in shared eccentric interests, takes a mysterious turn as Okabe probes Faris about a retro PC called the IBN 5100, which has a connection to their past. Okabe, in search of answers, is fixated on unraveling this enigmatic link, while Faris, normally bubbly and effusive, is struck by a wave of nostalgia and confusion. The discussion is marked by Okabe's recent realization of "D-Mails" - messages they've managed to send to the past - and its ramifications. As Faris grapples with her memories, she begins to recall forgotten events, her goal shifting from casual indulgence to self-discovery, thus setting the scene for an intriguing blend of suspense and nostalgia.
