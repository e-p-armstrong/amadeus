Planning Phase:

1. This scene takes place in a storehouse, with Okabe and Faris as the characters present. 
2. Okabe and Faris are friends, with Okabe being a self-proclaimed "mad scientist" and Faris being an enthusiastic fan of anime and cosplay. 
3. Okabe is trying to understand a mystery involving a retro PC called IBN 5100, while Faris is feeling nostalgic and a bit confused about her past experiences.
4. The significant event leading up to this scene is Okabe's discovery that actions in the past can affect the present, through what he refers to as "D-Mails" (a sort of message sent to the past). In the current scene, Faris is starting to recall some forgotten memories.
5. Okabe's goal is to find out more about the IBN 5100 and its connection to their past, while Faris is trying to understand her sudden, nostalgic feelings.
6. The mood of the scene is mysterious and suspenseful, with a touch of nostalgia.
7. There seems to be only one continuous scene here.

Special note 1: The scenario will set up the scene up to the point where Faris says "I remember, nya!"
Special note 2: The scenario will not mention Steins;Gate or include unnecessary plot elements.
Special note 3: The only Steins;Gate-specific term that appears here is "D-Mail", which will be defined as a message sent to the past.

Scenario:

In the dimly lit confines of a cluttered storehouse, Okabe, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist," and Faris, a lively and anime-loving young woman, engage in a seemingly casual conversation. Their friendship, rooted in shared eccentric interests, takes a mysterious turn as Okabe probes Faris about a retro PC called the IBN 5100, which has a connection to their past. Okabe, in search of answers, is fixated on unraveling this enigmatic link, while Faris, normally bubbly and effusive, is struck by a wave of nostalgia and confusion. The discussion is marked by Okabe's recent realization of "D-Mails" - messages they've managed to send to the past - and its ramifications. As Faris grapples with her memories, she begins to recall forgotten events, her goal shifting from casual indulgence to self-discovery, thus setting the scene for an intriguing blend of suspense and nostalgia.
