In an undisclosed location late at night, Okabe finds himself in the company of Faris and her father, a man he's just recently met. Okabe, a scientist who's discovered the ability to send messages to the past termed as 'D-Mails', is desperate to retrieve a computer known as the IBN 5100; a tool essential to undo his past actions and return to their original timeline. Faris, a member of Okabe's lab and a friend, seems embarrassed as her father recounts a tale of her past kidnapping and the sale of the IBN 5100 for her ransom. The revelation instigates a conflict within Okabe: he must undo a D-Mail that saved Faris's father to secure the computer and save his friend, Mayuri. As the scene unfolds, Okabe grapples with his decision, Faris seeks solace, and the overall atmosphere is pervaded by a sense of anxiety and melancholy.
