Brainstorm:

1. The scene most likely falls after Okabe and his friends have discovered the ability to send D-Mails, but before they've successfully managed to undo all of these D-Mails to return to their original timeline. This is evident from Okabe's longing for the IBN 5100, a computer needed to hack into SERN's database and erase the D-Mails.

2. The scene takes place in an undisclosed location, probably at night given the mention of midnight. Okabe, Faris, and Faris's Dad are the characters present.

3. Okabe is a friend and ally to Faris, who is a member of his future gadget lab. Faris's Dad is a new acquaintance to Okabe, who's just learned about his past involvement with Suzuha and the IBN 5100.

4. Okabe is feeling desperate, anxious, and conflicted. Faris seems embarrassed by her father's story, and Faris's Dad appears to be reminiscing. 

5. The significant events leading up to this scene are the discovery of D-Mails, their misuse, and the subsequent attempts to undo their effects. In this scene, Okabe is learning about the whereabouts of the IBN 5100 and contemplating on how to undo the D-Mail that saved Faris's father.

6. Okabe's goal in this scene is to figure out how to retrieve the IBN 5100 and resolve his internal conflict about undoing the D-Mail. Faris's goal seems to be seeking comfort from Okabe after a distressing event.

7. The scene's mood seems to be tense, anxious, and somewhat melancholic. 

8. Steins;Gate-specific terms include: D-Mails (messages sent to the past), IBN 5100 (a computer needed to hack into a database), SERN (a scientific research organization), and Rounders (a group associated with SERN).

Scenario:

In an undisclosed location late at night, Okabe finds himself in the company of Faris and her father, a man he's just recently met. Okabe, a scientist who's discovered the ability to send messages to the past termed as 'D-Mails', is desperate to retrieve a computer known as the IBN 5100; a tool essential to undo his past actions and return to their original timeline. Faris, a member of Okabe's lab and a friend, seems embarrassed as her father recounts a tale of her past kidnapping and the sale of the IBN 5100 for her ransom. The revelation instigates a conflict within Okabe: he must undo a D-Mail that saved Faris's father to secure the computer and save his friend, Mayuri. As the scene unfolds, Okabe grapples with his decision, Faris seeks solace, and the overall atmosphere is pervaded by a sense of anxiety and melancholy.
