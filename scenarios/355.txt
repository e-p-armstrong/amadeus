In a quiet, private setting, Okabe finds himself in a deep conversation with Faris, a usually playful and spirited friend who is now showing a serious and emotional side of herself. They share a friendly relationship often characterized by dramatic role-play, but the mood is different now. As Okabe grapples with his confusion and discomfort, Faris is opening up, baring her vulnerabilities and hidden pains. This change in dynamics is due to their shared knowledge of Okabe's time travel attempts to save a friend, specifically his use of D-mails, messages sent to the past that can alter the present. In this emotionally charged setting, Okabe is trying to understand the gravity of Faris's words and actions, while Faris is expressing her gratitude, revealing her personal tragedy, and offering to undo a past change for Okabe's cause. The atmosphere is tense, as they navigate this serious and heartfelt exchange.
