Okabe and Faris are in a quiet, solemn study, preparing to send a message back in time to alter a past event. Okabe, a scientist and friend, is assisting Faris, who is gathering the courage to say goodbye to her father. Previously, Faris had sent a message to her father in the past, which prevented him from boarding a plane that would have led to his death. This created an alternate timeline where he is alive. Now, they are about to undo this change, returning to the original timeline. Faris is trying to stay cheerful, donning her cat ears and slipping into her playful speech patterns, while Okabe battles with his guilt and uncertainty. Their task is to use the PhoneWave, a time-travel device, to send a D-Mail, a message to the past, ensuring Faris's father boards the plane. The mood in the room is heavy with regret and resignation, as they carry out their duty to restore the original timeline.
