Plan:
• The scene takes place in a private study where Okabe and Faris are preparing to send a message back in time to change a past event.
• Faris is about to bid farewell to her father, who, in this timeline, is alive. Okabe is there to assist and support Faris while managing the technicalities of sending the message.
• Okabe is conflicted, unsure if he is doing the right thing. Faris, on the other hand, is trying to stay cheerful despite having to say goodbye to her father. 
• Leading up to this scene, Faris had sent a message to her father in the past, preventing him from boarding a plane that would have led to his death. This action created an alternate timeline where he is alive. The characters have decided to undo this change, returning to the original timeline.
• Okabe's goal is to carry out the process of sending the message accurately, while also trying to comfort Faris. Faris's goal is to say goodbye to her father and come to terms with the decision she has made.
• The overall mood of the scene is melancholic and tense, filled with regret, resignation, and a sense of duty.
• Steins;Gate-specific terms to define: D-Mail (a message sent back in time), PhoneWave (the device used to send the D-Mail), and CRT (an old type of television, used as a necessary part of the PhoneWave setup).

Scenario:
Okabe and Faris are in a quiet, solemn study, preparing to send a message back in time to alter a past event. Okabe, a scientist and friend, is assisting Faris, who is gathering the courage to say goodbye to her father. Previously, Faris had sent a message to her father in the past, which prevented him from boarding a plane that would have led to his death. This created an alternate timeline where he is alive. Now, they are about to undo this change, returning to the original timeline. Faris is trying to stay cheerful, donning her cat ears and slipping into her playful speech patterns, while Okabe battles with his guilt and uncertainty. Their task is to use the PhoneWave, a time-travel device, to send a D-Mail, a message to the past, ensuring Faris's father boards the plane. The mood in the room is heavy with regret and resignation, as they carry out their duty to restore the original timeline.
