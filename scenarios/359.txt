 In a nondescript lab filled with an air of remorse, Okabe and Faris, two friends united in their pursuit of time travel, find themselves caught in a complicated situation. Okabe, shouldering a hefty burden of regret, has just altered the timeline, wiping away precious memories from Faris' mind - memories of tournaments won, narrow escapes, cherished conversations, and even the presence of her father. Faris is blissfully unaware of these changes and has innocently arrived to admire a costume crafted by their friend Mayuri. As Okabe grapples with his guilt and apologizes to Faris for the unintentional erasure of her past, he's also haunted by the transformation of the cityscape outside - the return of familiar stores signals that Faris has indeed lost her father in this timeline. The scene is steeped in melancholy as Okabe, caught in the ebb and flow of time's merciless tide, leaves the lab and heads towards a shrine, seeking information about an old computer, while wrestling with the pain of the sacrifices made.
