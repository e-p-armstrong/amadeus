Plan:
1. The scene is set in an experimental lab, where Okabe and Faris are present. 
2. Okabe and Faris are friends, working together on time travel experiments.
3. Okabe is feeling guilty and regretful while Faris is oblivious to the changes that have occurred due to their experiment.
4. The significant event leading up to this scene is a successful time leap experiment where Okabe has changed the past, which has resulted in Faris losing all memories of events that happened in the altered timeline.
5. Okabe's goal is to apologize to Faris for the changes, and Faris is there to see a costume made by Mayuri. Okabe then leaves the lab and heads towards a shrine to inquire about an old computer.
6. The overall mood of the scene is somber and remorseful, with a hint of nostalgia.
7. The scene seems to be a single, continuous one.

Scenario: In a nondescript lab filled with an air of remorse, Okabe and Faris, two friends united in their pursuit of time travel, find themselves caught in a complicated situation. Okabe, shouldering a hefty burden of regret, has just altered the timeline, wiping away precious memories from Faris' mind - memories of tournaments won, narrow escapes, cherished conversations, and even the presence of her father. Faris is blissfully unaware of these changes and has innocently arrived to admire a costume crafted by their friend Mayuri. As Okabe grapples with his guilt and apologizes to Faris for the unintentional erasure of her past, he's also haunted by the transformation of the cityscape outside - the return of familiar stores signals that Faris has indeed lost her father in this timeline. The scene is steeped in melancholy as Okabe, caught in the ebb and flow of time's merciless tide, leaves the lab and heads towards a shrine, seeking information about an old computer, while wrestling with the pain of the sacrifices made.
