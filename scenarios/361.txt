 In their shared scientific lab, Okabe finds himself in the company of Mayuri and Kurisu, two fellow scientists and friends he's worked closely with throughout their time travel adventures. Despite the shared history, the nuances of this new timeline have Okabe slightly disoriented; he questions the whereabouts of Daru, another member of their team, and the work commitments of Faris and Mayuri at a caf√© called 'MayQueen.' Mayuri, always playful, teases Okabe with a unique greeting while explaining her work schedule. Okabe, trying to adjust to this new reality, aims to understand the differences in this timeline, seeking familiarity in a world that's both new and not. The overall mood of the scene is light-hearted yet tinged with a hint of confusion as Okabe confronts the realities of the new, yet familiar timeline.
