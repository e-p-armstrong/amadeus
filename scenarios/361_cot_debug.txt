The conversation likely takes place after Okabe has successfully reached the Steins Gate timeline, where both Mayuri and Kurisu are alive. They are all in their shared lab, a place for invention and discovery. Okabe is trying to understand changes in this new timeline, specifically, the whereabouts of their friend Daru and the work commitments of Faris and Mayuri. The term 'MayQueen' probably refers to a café where Faris and Mayuri work. Okabe's unspoken lines seem to hint at his adjustment to this timeline and the associated changes.

Scenario: In their shared scientific lab, Okabe finds himself in the company of Mayuri and Kurisu, two fellow scientists and friends he's worked closely with throughout their time travel adventures. Despite the shared history, the nuances of this new timeline have Okabe slightly disoriented; he questions the whereabouts of Daru, another member of their team, and the work commitments of Faris and Mayuri at a café called 'MayQueen.' Mayuri, always playful, teases Okabe with a unique greeting while explaining her work schedule. Okabe, trying to adjust to this new reality, aims to understand the differences in this timeline, seeking familiarity in a world that's both new and not. The overall mood of the scene is light-hearted yet tinged with a hint of confusion as Okabe confronts the realities of the new, yet familiar timeline.
