Brainstorming & Planning:

- The scene is likely happening in the Future Gadget Laboratory, as Okabe mentions the Time Leap Machine and the development room. 
- The characters present are Okabe and Kurisu, with Itaru (Daru) on the phone. 
- Okabe and Kurisu are fellow scientists and friends, while Daru is Okabe's trusted friend and a fellow lab member. 
- Okabe is anxious and desperate, struggling to find a way to save Mayuri. Kurisu is not explicitly mentioned, but given the context, she is likely concerned and supportive. Daru is stressed and worried, having just lost Mayuri.
- In the lead-up to the scene, Okabe has been repeatedly leaping back in time in an attempt to prevent Mayuri's death. However, his efforts have so far been unsuccessful. 
- In the scene, Mayuri has once again been kidnapped (and likely killed). Okabe, despite his preparation, is unable to prevent this. 
- The Time Leap Machine is a device that allows one to send their memories to their past self. The Rounders are a group that has been threatening Okabe and his friends. 
- Okabe's goal is to save Mayuri; Kurisu's goal, although not explicitly stated, is likely to support Okabe in his efforts; Daru's goal is to protect Mayuri and inform Okabe of the situation.
- The overall mood is tense and desperate.

Scenario:
In the cluttered space of a makeshift lab, Okabe, a scientist trapped in a tragic cycle of time, is with Kurisu, his intelligent and supportive colleague. Okabe has been repeatedly using a machine to send his memories back in time, in a desperate attempt to save his friend Mayuri from an impending death that seems to persist no matter what he changes. As Okabe struggles with his latest time leap, he receives a distressing call from his friend Daru, who had been guarding Mayuri but failed to protect her from a dangerous group known as the Rounders. Overwhelmed with frustration and desperation, Okabe prepares to leap through time again, hoping that this time, he can save Mayuri. The scene is charged with desperation and determination, as Okabe refuses to accept the grim fate that seems to await his friend.
