 Okabe and Kurisu, two scientists, are in their laboratory, a place where they've spent countless hours working on their shared project of inventing a device that can send messages, or "D-Mails," to the past. The two share a close relationship, marked by mutual respect, shared burdens, and a fair amount of good-natured teasing. Okabe, wrestling with guilt and frustration, is seeking advice from Kurisu on a delicate problem: they must reverse a change they made in the past that turned their friend Lukako from a boy into a girl, because this change has tragically led to their friend Mayuri's death in the present. The conversation is serious and marked by tension, but also tinged with an element of absurdity, given the nature of the problem. Okabe's goal is to find a way to reverse the change they've made in Lukako's gender, while causing as little pain as possible; Kurisu, meanwhile, is trying to help him find a solution to this unique dilemma.
