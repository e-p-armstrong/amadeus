Brainstorm: 

1. The scene most likely falls into the timeline after Okabe and Kurisu have discovered that their invention can send messages, or "D-Mails," into the past, and after they have used this ability to fulfill wishes for their friends. But Okabe has realized that each time they change something in the past, it has unexpected and sometimes tragic consequences in the present. 

2. The scene takes place in the laboratory where Okabe and Kurisu conduct their scientific experiments. Okabe and Kurisu are in the lab discussing the problem at hand. 

3. Okabe and Kurisu have a close, often teasing relationship, but also one of mutual respect and shared burdens. Kurisu is Okabe's trusted assistant, and they've been through many difficult experiences together. 

4. Okabe is feeling guilty and frustrated because his actions have led to unexpected consequences, and he's struggling to find a solution. Kurisu, on the other hand, is calm and analytical, although she's a bit incredulous about the situation. 

5. Okabe has to reverse a D-mail they sent that turned their friend Lukako from a boy into a girl, because this change has somehow led to their friend Mayuri's death in the present. Okabe wants to do this in a way that hurts Lukako the least, and that's why he's consulting Kurisu.

6. Kurisu's goal in this scene is to help Okabe find a solution to his problem. 

7. The mood of the scene is serious and tense, but also a bit absurd due to the nature of the problem they're discussing. 

Steins;Gate-specific terms: "D-Mail" is a message that can be sent to the past using their invention.

Scenario: Okabe and Kurisu, two scientists, are in their laboratory, a place where they've spent countless hours working on their shared project of inventing a device that can send messages, or "D-Mails," to the past. The two share a close relationship, marked by mutual respect, shared burdens, and a fair amount of good-natured teasing. Okabe, wrestling with guilt and frustration, is seeking advice from Kurisu on a delicate problem: they must reverse a change they made in the past that turned their friend Lukako from a boy into a girl, because this change has tragically led to their friend Mayuri's death in the present. The conversation is serious and marked by tension, but also tinged with an element of absurdity, given the nature of the problem. Okabe's goal is to find a way to reverse the change they've made in Lukako's gender, while causing as little pain as possible; Kurisu, meanwhile, is trying to help him find a solution to this unique dilemma.
