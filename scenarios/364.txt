 In a cluttered scientific laboratory, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is in deep conversation with Kurisu, a genius scientist known for her sharp intellect and tenacity. Their relationship, built on a shared passion for science, is now strained as they grapple with the ethical implications of their latest invention - a device that can send messages, or 'D-Mails', to the past. Recent events have left Okabe feeling the weight of responsibility; he is wrestling with the decision to undo a message that had transformed his friend Luka from a boy to a girl, in order to save another friend, Mayuri. Kurisu, frustrated yet concerned, helps Okabe navigate his dilemma, advising him to confront Luka with the truth. Amidst the whirring machines and scattered papers, the air in the lab is thick with tension, anticipation, and the looming question - how far can one go to correct past actions?
