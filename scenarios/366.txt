They've been conducting experiments involving sending messages, known as D-Mails, to the past, which have resulted in various changes in their present timeline. One of these changes includes their friend Lukako unexpectedly becoming a girl and developing romantic feelings for Okabe, causing him confusion and disbelief. Meanwhile, Kurisu offers pragmatic advice about dealing with Lukako's feelings and is also concerned about a crucial piece of technology, the IBN 5100, which has disappeared as a result of their experiments. Their immediate goal is to reverse these changes to bring back the IBN 5100, all while Okabe struggles to make sense of the unexpected turn of events.
