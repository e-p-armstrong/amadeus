In the confines of a cramped laboratory, old friends Okabe and Mayuri find themselves in a tense confrontation. Okabe, a self-styled mad scientist, is wrestling with a heavy secret, while Mayuri, his caring and usually cheerful friend, is trying to break through his defenses. The usually jovial atmosphere is strained as Mayuri, upset over a perceived slight against their mutual friend, Luka, seeks answers from Okabe. Previously, Okabe had upset Luka with a sensitive revelation about Mayuri's fate, a secret he is desperate to keep from Mayuri herself. As the scene unfolds, Okabe is driven by the need to protect Mayuri from a harsh reality, while Mayuri, sensing something amiss, is determined to help her friend, not realizing the gravity of the situation. The mood is somber and tense, a testament to the strain on their friendship.
