In the confines of a cramped laboratory, old friends Okabe and Mayuri find themselves in a tense confrontation.

The usually jovial atmosphere is strained as Mayuri, upset over a perceived slight against their mutual friend, Luka, seeks answers from Okabe. Previously, Okabe had upset Luka with a sensitive revelation about Mayuri's fate, a secret he is desperate to keep from Mayuri herself.
