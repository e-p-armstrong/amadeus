Scenario: In the tranquil setting of a shrine's courtyard, Okabe, a scientist with a knack for bending time, meets with his friend Luka, a gentle soul who he inadvertently transformed from a boy to a girl in one of his experiments. Their friendship, once simple, is now strained under the weight of this significant change. Okabe, awkward and anxious, seeks to rectify the situation, while Luka, apprehensive and filled with a mix of confusion and courage, faces the prospect of a daunting conversation. Back at their shared laboratory, their friend Mayuri is left behind, a trace of sadness in her eyes as she watches Okabe leave. The atmosphere is thick with tension and apprehension as Okabe aims to convince Luka to accept a gender reversal to preserve the original timeline, while Luka prepares to negotiate terms for this life-altering decision.
