Scenario:

In an intimate setting, Okabe finds himself face-to-face with Luka, a friend who harbors romantic feelings for him, feelings he has recently learned about from his fellow scientist, Kurisu. As the tension builds, Luka gathers her courage to confess her love, asking Okabe to be her boyfriend. Caught off guard and flustered, Okabe flees the scene, leaving Luka alone with her confession hanging in the air. Back in their lab, Okabe tries to regain his composure in front of an oblivious Mayuri, while setting up their Time Leap Machine, a device capable of sending a person's memories back in time. Okabe's goal is to escape from his current predicament by using the machine to leap back in time, leaving the present far behind. The overall mood of the scene is a mix of awkward tension, punctuated by Okabe's comedic overreaction and ending on a note of anticipation as he prepares to jump back in time.
