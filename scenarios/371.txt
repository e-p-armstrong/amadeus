In the tranquil surroundings of Yanabayashi Shrine, Okabe and Kurisu, two friends and fellow scientists, are about to have a difficult conversation with Luka, a shy and gentle friend of theirs. Okabe and Kurisu share a camaraderie built from countless shared experiences, while Luka is an innocent bystander in their scientific endeavors. Okabe, carrying a heavy burden of knowledge about the past that only he remembers, hopes to convince Luka of a hard truth - that she was originally male before an experiment involving sending messages to the past changed her gender. Kurisu, a genius but socially awkward scientist, is tasked with explaining the differences between male and female brains to Luka, as part of Okabe's plan to gently reveal the truth. The overall mood of the scene is tense, with Okabe and Kurisu trying to navigate a delicate and potentially distressing revelation, and Luka oblivious to the gravity of the conversation she's about to be part of.
