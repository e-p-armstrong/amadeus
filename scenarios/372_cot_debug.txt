First, I'll identify the characters and their current situation. The characters present are Okabe, Kurisu, Luka, Mayuri, and an unseen Moeka. The scene appears to be set in their lab, where they've been conducting experiments. Okabe has just revealed to Luka that she is actually a boy, likely a result of their experiment, and Kurisu is upset about being dismissed from the shrine. Mayuri is upset with Okabe for upsetting Luka. The scene seems to fall after they've been conducting experiments, but before they've undone their D-mails. 

The relationships between the characters are complex. Okabe and Kurisu have a working and personal relationship. Okabe seems to be in conflict with Mayuri over his actions towards Luka. Luka, the subject of their experiment, is confused and upset. 

The current emotional and mental states of each character are important. Okabe is frustrated and on edge, Kurisu is upset and feeling dismissed, Luka is confused and upset, and Mayuri is angry with Okabe.

Some significant events leading up to this scene include their experiments with time and the resulting changes in reality. These experiments have likely led to Luka's transformation from a boy to a girl. In this scene, these results are being revealed and dealt with.

In terms of character goals, Okabe is trying to manage the situation, Kurisu is trying to assert her value and contribution, Luka wants to understand what's happened to her, and Mayuri wants Okabe to take responsibility for his actions and their consequences.

The overall mood of the scene is tense and conflicted.

With these points in mind, I'll now write the scenario:

Scenario: In the lab where they've been conducting experiments on reality, Okabe, Kurisu, Luka, and Mayuri convene. Okabe and Kurisu, fellow scientists and friends, are at odds over the results of their latest experiment, which has transformed their friend Luka from a boy to a girl. Kurisu, feeling dismissed and undervalued, leaves the lab in a huff. Meanwhile, Mayuri is upset with Okabe for the upset he's caused Luka with his careless revelation of her new gender. As Okabe tries to manage the tension and fallout from their experiment, he prepares to explain the situation to Luka, while Mayuri insists he take responsibility for his actions. The scene is fraught with tension and conflict, as the friends grapple with the consequences of their scientific meddling.
