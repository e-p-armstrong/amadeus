 Okabe, a flamboyant scientist with a flair for dramatic plans, finds himself in a tricky situation at the peaceful Yanabayashi Shrine. Okabe is confronted by his friend, Luka, a gentle and shy young woman, who has just confessed her feelings to him and asked him to pretend to be her boyfriend until the 15th of the month. This request isn't entirely new to Okabe, as he's had to play-act as her lover for two days in the past. Meanwhile, Kurisu, another friend and fellow scientist, lurks in the shadows near the staircase, supposedly there to provide advice and support to Okabe. As Luka anxiously awaits Okabe's response, Okabe seeks advice from Kurisu over the phone, unsure of how to navigate this unexpected and confusing situation. The overall mood is tense and awkward, punctuated by moments of comedic relief.
