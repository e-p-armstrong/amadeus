 
In the serene surroundings of a shrine, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, finds himself in a sentimental exchange with Luka, a shy and sweet individual. They are not alone; Kurisu, a fellow scientist and Okabe's friend, is also present, albeit slightly detached. Okabe, usually eccentric, appears flustered as he navigates an unusual situation - he's agreed to 'date' Luka for a limited time, a decision that leaves Luka both tearful and overjoyed. This agreement is the result of their recent experiments with 'D-mails' - messages they have learned to send to the past, altering timelines and realities. As Okabe tries to manage Luka's emotional response and plan their first date, he also has to deal with Kurisu's sharp observations and comments. It's a scene filled with mixed emotions - joy, confusion, and an underlying tension.
