In a quirky maid cafe in the heart of Akihabara, Okabe Rintaro and his fellow scientist Kurisu Makise find themselves in an unusual discussion. While their relationship is often defined by intellectual debates and disagreements, in this instance, they find themselves navigating the complex dynamics of a first date. Okabe, usually confident, is showing signs of unease and anxiety, while Kurisu, always keen to challenge him, is taking this opportunity to tease him mercilessly. The backdrop to this unusual situation is Okabe's desperate attempt to change the course of events that threaten the life of his friend, Mayuri, by agreeing to go on a date with another friend, Lukako. As Kurisu offers her advice and insights on dating etiquette, the atmosphere is light-hearted yet tinged with an underlying tension, as they both understand the gravity of the upcoming date's potential consequences.
