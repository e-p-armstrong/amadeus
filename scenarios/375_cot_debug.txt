Scenario:
In a quirky maid cafe in the heart of Akihabara, Okabe Rintaro and his fellow scientist Kurisu Makise find themselves in an unusual discussion. While their relationship is often defined by intellectual debates and disagreements, in this instance, they find themselves navigating the complex dynamics of a first date. Okabe, usually confident, is showing signs of unease and anxiety, while Kurisu, always keen to challenge him, is taking this opportunity to tease him mercilessly.
