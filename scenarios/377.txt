Okabe, the eccentric scientist, finds himself engaged in a playful banter with his friend Faris and his assistant Kurisu at their lab in Akihabara, Tokyo. Faris, known for her cat-like mannerisms, teases Okabe about his romantic interests, while the sharp-witted Kurisu joins in the teasing. Although the atmosphere is light-hearted, Okabe feels a pang of loneliness, possibly due to his recent actions of manipulating time - actions that have led to changes in his relationships with his friends. The following day, he tries to overcome his emotional turmoil by spending time with Luka, a quiet and shy friend, in a casual stroll around town. Okabe aims to maintain a sense of normalcy amidst the chaos of his time-leaping experiments, while Luka desires a deeper connection with Okabe, initiating a conversation about their past. The overall mood of the scene transitions from playful teasing to introspective contemplation.
