In a casual gathering spot for a close-knit group of friends, Okabe, Itaru, Mayuri, and Luka are engaged in a light-hearted discussion about dating. Their relationships with each other are comfortable and friendly, with an undercurrent of romantic tension between Okabe and Luka. Okabe is trying to understand Luka's recent confession of her feelings for him, and why she remembers something he said in a different timeline - a seemingly impossible memory. This discussion leads to a visit to a shrine the next morning, where Okabe, in a more serious tone, questions Luka about her memories and feelings. The overall mood shifts from casual banter to introspection as Okabe delves into the mystery of Luka's memories.
