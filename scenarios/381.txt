At the bustling ComiMa festival, a massive gathering of anime and manga enthusiasts in Tokyo, Okabe, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist," is trying to make amends with Lukako, a close friend he has recently hurt. Okabe, feeling guilty for his actions, brings Lukako to the festival hoping to cheer her up and mend their strained relationship. They meet up with their cheerful friend Mayuri, who is blissfully unaware of the tension between Okabe and Lukako. Okabe's actions stem from a previous decision he made that deeply affected Lukako - he undid a text message sent to the past, which had initially changed Lukako's gender, causing her much distress. Now, his goal is to show Lukako a good time at the festival and alleviate the strain between them. The overall mood of the scene is strained but hopeful, as Okabe tries to navigate through the crowded festival, battling his guilt, and figuring out how to make things right.
