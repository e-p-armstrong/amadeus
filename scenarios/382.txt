In an attempt to navigate this tension, Okabe tries to involve Lukako in the convention activities, despite his own lack of interest. Meanwhile, the ever-optimistic Mayuri tries to lighten the mood by suggesting they all participate in cosplaying, not realizing the underlying tension. The scene is a blend of excitement and discomfort, a jubilant convention backdrop clashing with the palpable awkwardness between Okabe and Lukako.
