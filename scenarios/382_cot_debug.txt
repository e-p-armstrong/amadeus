Scenario:
The scene unfolds amidst the bustling and chaotic atmosphere of ComiMa, a convention for enthusiasts of anime, manga, and cosplay. Okabe, a scientist and self-proclaimed madman, is there with Lukako, a timid and submissive young man with whom he shares a complicated romantic relationship, and Mayuri, their cheerful friend with a passion for cosplay. Tension simmers between Okabe and Lukako due to an awkwardness that has lingered since a recent incident, making their interactions strained and their romantic status questionable. In an attempt to navigate this tension, Okabe tries to involve Lukako in the convention activities, despite his own lack of interest. Meanwhile, the ever-optimistic Mayuri tries to lighten the mood by suggesting they all participate in cosplaying, not realizing the underlying tension. The scene is a blend of excitement and discomfort, a jubilant convention backdrop clashing with the palpable awkwardness between Okabe and Lukako.
