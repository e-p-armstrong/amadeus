The timeline of this scene seems to be set during Okabe's attempts to undo the effects of the D-mails, specifically the one that turned Luka from a boy into a girl. The dialogue indicates that Okabe and Luka have been in a romantic relationship that is about to end, likely because Okabe is about to undo the D-mail that changed Luka's gender. This would revert Luka back to being a boy and erase the memories of their relationship.

"Scenario: At a traditional Japanese shrine, we find Okabe Rintaro, a scientist with the unique ability to remember changes in timelines, and Luka Urushibara, a shy, delicate individual who has been temporarily transformed into a girl due to an experiment involving sending messages to the past. The two have shared a romantic relationship, one that is now coming to a heartbreaking end as Okabe must undo the change to save a friend. As Okabe approaches Luka, who has started crying, he is racked with guilt and regret, unsure of how to comfort her. Despite her tears, Luka thanks Okabe, expressing gratitude for their time together, a sentiment that Okabe struggles to accept as he believes he's caused her pain. Okabe's goal in this scene is to gather the courage to undo the change he made to Luka's gender, therefore erasing their relationship, while Luka's goal is to express her feelings and say her goodbyes before the inevitable change occurs. The overall mood of this scene is a poignant mix of sorrow and regret, as two individuals are forced to part ways due to circumstances beyond their control."
