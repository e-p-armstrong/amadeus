Scenario:
At a serene shrine, Okabe and Luka, who once shared a brief romantic relationship, are the only ones present. Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist who has recently experienced the traumatic death of his friend Mayuri, is trying to revert to his delusional persona, Hououin Kyouma. As Kyouma, he sees Luka not as a romantic partner, but as his disciple in a fictional school of swordsmanship, the Seishin Zanma. The emotional terrain is complex: Okabe is summoning his old self in an attempt to restore some sense of normalcy and comfort Luka, while Luka, caught off guard by this shift, struggles to understand and accept their new dynamic. As the scene unfolds, Okabe starts a training session, engaging Luka in their shared delusions about the swordsmanship, hoping to bring a slice of their old life back, while Luka, despite her initial confusion, starts warming up to Okabe's effort. The overall mood of the scene is bittersweet â€” a mix of nostalgic happiness and poignant sadness.
