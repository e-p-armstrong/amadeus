Scenario:

In a calm outdoor setting, Okabe, a devoted martial arts instructor, and Luka, his diligent student, are sharing a moment of respite after a strenuous workout. Their relationship is one of mutual respect and deep friendship, but it is also tinged with the gravity of shared secrets. As they enjoy the post-workout fatigue, Luka dares to bring up a topic that has been looming over them - her memories from when she was a guy. Okabe, having been recently engrossed in a complex manual, is taken aback, but eager to understand what Luka remembers. His anticipation grows when Luka mentions an "old computer" - a crucial piece of technology for their scientific research. As Luka steels herself to reveal more, Okabe hopes these revelations could change the course of their research. The conversation that started with post-workout banter becomes a serious discussion, shifting the mood from relaxed to intense.
