They share a bond of mutual respect and trust, but the atmosphere between them is tense and fraught with guilt. As Luka faces away from the locker, she reveals a regrettable act from the past - she broke and hid a vital computer, the IBN 5100, fearing Okabe's reaction. The revelation comes as a shock to Okabe, who had been on a quest to correct the course of events that have gone awry due to their ability to send messages to the past. As they stand in the dim alley, their primary goal is to come to terms with this unfortunate revelation and its implications. The scene is steeped in a melancholic air, the weight of their regrets hanging heavily between them.
