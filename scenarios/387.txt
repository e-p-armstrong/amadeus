At the Yanabayashi Shrine, under a scarlet setting sun, friends Okabe and Luka have a heart-to-heart conversation. Their relationship is complex, marked by unrequited feelings and a shared secret â€” they've been meddling with the past. They're grappling with the effects of their actions: Luka, in her quest to change her gender, has caused an unforeseen change in the timeline, preventing an old computer from reaching Okabe. This computer holds significant importance for Okabe, who is desperate to correct the timeline to save another friend. Luka, understanding the gravity of the situation, decides to return to her original male identity, an emotional decision that sees her saying a somber goodbye to Okabe. The scene is heavy with melancholy as Okabe prepares to send another message to the past using a device they've nicknamed the 'PhoneWave', an invention that allows them to send text messages, or 'D-mails', back in time. Their collective goal is to restore the timeline to its original state, with each carrying their individual emotional burdens as they attempt to rectify their mistakes. The overall mood of the scene is bittersweet, a mixture of regret, acceptance, and hope.
