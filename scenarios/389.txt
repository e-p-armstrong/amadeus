Okabe finds himself at a quiet, serene shrine with his friend Luka. They share a complex relationship, colored by Okabe's manipulation of time to alter aspects of Luka's life. After seemingly countless time-leaps meant to prevent the death of a mutual friend, Okabe is emotionally drained and ridden with guilt. In contrast, Luka is mostly confused, trying to understand the strange questions and behavior of Okabe. 

In this instance, Okabe has just executed a time leap that altered Luka's gender back to his original state as a boy, and he's trying to confirm the restoration of an important object â€” a vintage computer that was broken in the previous timeline when Luka was a girl. The air is heavy with tension, punctuated by Okabe's desperation and Luka's bewilderment.
