 In an antique storehouse owned by Luka's father, Okabe waits nervously for the outcome of a search for a critical piece of technology â€“ an old computer named IBN 5100. The relationship between Okabe, Luka, and Luka's father is amicable, with Okabe being the leader directing their actions due to his knowledge about time alteration technology, referred to as "D-mails". The uncertain state of the computer's existence leaves Okabe anxious and desperate, while Luka and his father remain supportive but mostly in the dark about the gravity of the situation. As the search reveals that the computer might have been stolen, Okabe's dread intensifies, and he contemplates the next steps to restore the original timeline. The overall mood is tense and somber as Okabe struggles to find a solution, with his friends rallying to offer their support in his time of need.
