 Okabe, Kurisu, and Mayuri are in their shared lab, having finished a meal together. Okabe and Kurisu, two close friends who often engage in private, technical discussions, are teased by the cheerful Mayuri about their secretive meetings. Despite the light-hearted banter, Okabe is wrestling with a serious issue: the postponement of an anticipated tragic event, Mayuri's death. While Mayuri is inviting the others to a comic book convention, Okabe is subtly trying to convince Kurisu to attend, all the while planning a search for a person named Moeka. The mood is upbeat, but an undercurrent of tension persists due to Okabe's hidden concerns.
