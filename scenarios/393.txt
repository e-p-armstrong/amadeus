In a cluttered lab filled with electronic equipment, Okabe and Kurisu, two friends who are also amateur scientists, are in the middle of a tense conversation about their time-travel experiments. They share a deep bond, having worked together on numerous projects, often teetering on the brink of groundbreaking discoveries, but this time, the stakes are high. Okabe, burdened by the knowledge that Mayuri, another close friend, is in danger because of their experiments, is planning his next steps while Kurisu is showing rare concern for his well-being. Adding to the tension, Okabe is trying to locate Moeka, a seemingly elusive associate from their circle, who is believed to work at a company called Arc Rewrite. The overall mood is anxious; Okabe is desperate to save Mayuri, while Kurisu is concerned for Okabe, and their search for Moeka adds another layer of suspense to the scene.
