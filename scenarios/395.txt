 In the midst of a tense situation, Okabe finds himself on a phone call with his close friend and fellow scientist, Kurisu. They have landed themselves in a perilous situation following their experiments with time travel, specifically using a device they invented called the Time Leap Machine, which can send memories to the past, thereby altering timelines or 'worldlines.' Okabe is about to confront an adversary from a powerful organization known as SERN to save their mutual friend Mayuri, and Kurisu is providing him with harsh but necessary advice. Her suggestion of taking extreme measures, even murder if necessary, to ensure their survival hints at the grim reality they're grappling with. As Okabe wrestles with the moral implications of Kurisu's guidance, the atmosphere is tense and fraught with desperation.
