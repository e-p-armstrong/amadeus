Scenario: Okabe and his close friend Kurisu, both scientists, find themselves in a tense situation. Okabe is in a dimly lit walkway, clutching a flashy purple phone, while Kurisu assists him over a phone call from a separate location. They've been experimenting with a device they've invented, the PhoneWave, which allows them to send messages, or D-mails, into the past, changing the timeline. However, Okabe's recent attempts to send D-mails and alter the timeline have been unsuccessful. He frantically sends different messages, hoping to trigger a change, while Kurisu tries to troubleshoot the problem from her end. The mood is desperate and suspenseful, as they struggle to understand why their time-altering device isn't working as expected.
