 Trapped in a room while under attack by a frenzied woman named Moeka, the self-proclaimed "mad scientist" Okabe is on the phone with his friend and fellow scientist Kurisu, whom he teasingly calls "Christina." Previously, they had discovered a way to send messages, called "D-Mails," back in time, and they along with a few others, including Moeka, used this ability to alter their present circumstances. However, they are now trying to undo these changes, and Moeka's D-Mail has proven particularly troublesome. Okabe is frantic and terrified, desperate to figure out what Moeka's D-Mail said so he can cancel its effects, while Kurisu is worried and eager to help him. The situation is tense and desperate, as Okabe digs through Moeka's phone for answers while evading her violent attempts to reclaim it.
