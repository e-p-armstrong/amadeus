 Inside a lab, scientists Okabe and Kurisu are huddled around a makeshift time machine, the PhoneWave, preparing to send a text message into the past - a D-mail. They share a bond of camaraderie and mutual respect, born from shared experiences of the impossible. Okabe, his mind a whirlwind of anxiety and determination, is trying to undo the effects of a previous D-mail. Kurisu, cool yet concerned, assists him, her mind racing to figure out the puzzle of their failed attempts. Their goal is clear - to send the D-mail successfully and alter the past, but the tension in the air is palpable as they struggle to understand why their attempts aren't working.
