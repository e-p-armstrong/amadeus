The scene likely falls in the middle of the story, where Okabe and Kurisu are trying to undo the consequences of the D-mails they've sent. The terms "D-mail", "PhoneWave", "Reading Steiner", "IBN 5100", and "FB" need to be defined in the scenario.

D-Mail: A type of text message sent to the past.
PhoneWave: A makeshift time machine that can send D-mails.
Reading Steiner: Okabe's ability to retain his memories across different timelines.
IBN 5100: An old computer needed by the characters.
FB: The mysterious figure who orders Moeka around.

Plan:
1. The scene is set in a lab, where Okabe and Kurisu are working on the PhoneWave. They are trying to send a D-mail.
2. Okabe and Kurisu are close colleagues, working together to fix the consequences of the D-mails they've sent.
3. Okabe is anxious and determined, while Kurisu is focused and concerned.
4. They have been sending D-mails, altering the past and causing unforeseen consequences. Now they are trying to undo these changes by sending another D-mail, but their attempt fails. They are stuck, trying to figure out why it's not working and what to do next.
5. Okabe's goal is to successfully send the D-mail and change the past, while Kurisu's goal is to assist him and figure out why their earlier attempts failed.
6. The overall mood of the scene is tense and fraught with urgency.
7. There's only one continuous scene.

Scenario: Inside a lab, scientists Okabe and Kurisu are huddled around a makeshift time machine, the PhoneWave, preparing to send a text message into the past - a D-mail. They share a bond of camaraderie and mutual respect, born from shared experiences of the impossible. Okabe, his mind a whirlwind of anxiety and determination, is trying to undo the effects of a previous D-mail. Kurisu, cool yet concerned, assists him, her mind racing to figure out the puzzle of their failed attempts. Their goal is clear - to send the D-mail successfully and alter the past, but the tension in the air is palpable as they struggle to understand why their attempts aren't working.
