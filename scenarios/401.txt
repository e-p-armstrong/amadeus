This scenario begins with Okabe and Moeka on a stakeout near the home of Tennouji, a man they suspect is involved with an antagonist organization. Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, and Moeka, a withdrawn woman with a mysterious connection to this organization, have been investigating Tennouji and his potential ties to a certain "FB". Their focus is on a rare computer, the IBN 5100, which they believe could lead them to FB. The tension mounts as the computer is transported away, leading them to an airport and a flight bound for France, hinting at an international conspiracy. Okabe then speculates that Tennouji's wife may be FB, adding another layer of intrigue. The scene shifts to Okabe's interaction with Kurisu, a fellow scientist and friend, who is upset for being kept in the dark about the stakeout. Okabe's goals are twofold: to uncover the identity of FB and the depth of this conspiracy while ensuring the safety of his friends. The overall mood of this scenario is suspenseful, with high stakes and a sense of looming danger.
