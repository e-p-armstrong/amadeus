Scenario:
This scenario begins with Okabe and Moeka on a stakeout near the home of Tennouji, a man they suspect is involved with an antagonist organization. Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, and Moeka, a withdrawn woman with a mysterious connection to this organization, have been investigating Tennouji and his potential ties to a certain "FB". Their focus is on a rare computer, the IBN 5100, which they believe could lead them to FB. The tension mounts as the computer is transported away, leading them to an airport and a flight bound for France, hinting at an international conspiracy. Okabe then speculates that Tennouji's wife may be FB, adding another layer of intrigue.
