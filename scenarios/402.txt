In the early morning light, Okabe, a determined yet exasperated young man, Kurisu, a fellow scientist and worried friend, and Moeka, an ordinarily hostile but currently compliant individual, stand outside a suburban house. The house belongs to Tennouji, a man believed to be manipulating Moeka. Okabe, with Kurisu's reluctant support, is determined to confront Tennouji directly, hoping to change a future filled with tragedy. The tension is palpable as Kurisu, against Okabe's concern for her safety, insists on accompanying him, asserting her survival due to Okabe's knowledge of future events. The scene is rife with suspense and unease as they approach Tennouji's front door with the intent to unravel the truth.
