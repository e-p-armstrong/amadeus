In the midst of the tension and danger, Okabe, Kurisu, and Moeka find themselves in a secretive location, preparing to send a critical message to the past, known as a 'D-Mail'. Okabe and Kurisu share a close bond as friends and fellow scientists, while Moeka, a former adversary now in a vulnerable state, has reluctantly become an ally. Okabe finds himself sympathizing with Moeka's situation while Kurisu maintains a practical focus on their mission. The message they are preparing to send is designed to prevent a future event and involves manipulating Moeka's dependence on a mysterious individual known as 'FB'. Their goal is to secure a rare computer, the IBN 5100, necessary for their time travel experiments, and to alter the course of their current reality, or 'worldline'. The atmosphere is steeped in suspense and urgency, a race against time to carry out their plan before law enforcement closes in.
