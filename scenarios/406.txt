In a traditional Japanese room adorned with tatami mats, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, finds himself in a tense situation with Moeka, a woman who has played the roles of both ally and adversary in different timelines. They are joined by Kurisu, a fellow scientist and friend, who shares Okabe's concerns about their time travel experiments. Okabe's mind is a whirlpool of emotions as he tries to make sense of this new timeline where Moeka seems to be following orders from her enigmatic supervisor, FB. This timeline appears to be a direct result of their time travel experiments, specifically the use of "D-Mails" - text messages sent back in time, leading to alterations in the timeline. As Okabe tries to understand the ramifications of his actions, he is haunted by the words of Tennouji and Nae, characters who have had a complicated relationship with him in different timelines. In this uncertain and tense atmosphere, Okabe seeks answers while Kurisu urges him to send another D-Mail to rectify their timeline, thus setting the stage for a confrontation between the principles of science and the unpredictable nature of human actions.
