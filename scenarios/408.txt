He has just discovered that the IBN 5100, previously lost in a conflict, is back in his possession, sparking a hope to save a dear friend, Mayuri. Okabe is now geared to confirm the presence of this crucial device and prepare for the next step, while a puzzled Kurisu is trying to keep up with Okabe's flurry of activity. The mood is tense but hopeful, underscoring the high stakes of their work and the glimmer of optimism that their mission might just succeed.
