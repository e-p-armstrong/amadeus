In a cluttered, makeshift lab, Okabe, Kurisu, and Itaru (Daru) are in the throes of a covert operation. Okabe, an energetic and eccentric self-proclaimed mad scientist, is rallying his team for the final phase of their mission: to expose the shadowy organization, SERN, that they suspect of unethical time-travel experiments. Kurisu, an exhausted but brilliant scientist, is trying to catch some sleep amidst the chaos, while Daru, a skilled hacker and Okabe's loyal friend, multitasks between understanding the workings of the recently discovered IBN 5100 computer and preparing for a comic market event. They believe that the IBN 5100 is the key to infiltrating SERN's most secure database, which they hope to destroy from the inside. Amidst Okabe's dramatic speeches and the ensuing banter, the mood in the room is a tense mix of high stakes, exhaustion, and humor.
