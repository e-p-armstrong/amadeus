In the cluttered confines of the Future Gadget Lab, three friends, Okabe, Kurisu, and Daru, huddle around their makeshift time-traveling technology. Okabe, driven by a desperate determination, explains his plan to his fellow lab members to escape their current reality where their dear friend Mayuri faces an inevitable death. Kurisu, the brilliant scientist who has helped fine-tune their time-traveling technology, listens intently while Daru, the skilled hacker and Okabe's loyal friend, attempts to lighten the mood with his usual humor. Amid the tension, Okabe reveals his intention to undo all alterations to the past, beginning with the erasure of the first message they sent back in time â€” a message intercepted by a shadowy organization named SERN, leading to a series of unfortunate events. As Okabe pleads for their cooperation, each character is faced with a choice: to trust in Okabe's desperate plan and risk everything they've worked for, or to let their current reality remain unchallenged. The overall atmosphere is one of tense anticipation, as the weight of their past failures and the hope for a better future hang in the balance.
