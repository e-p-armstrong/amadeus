Planning Phase:
The scene takes place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, where Okabe Rintaro, the self-proclaimed "mad scientist", is discussing his plan to escape the current timeline (referred to as the "Alpha worldline") where their friend, Mayuri, is doomed to die. Present are his fellow lab members: Kurisu Makise, a brilliant scientist who's helped improve their time-traveling technology, and Itaru "Daru" Hashida, a skilled hacker and Okabe's loyal friend. The weight of countless failed attempts at saving Mayuri hangs heavy on Okabe, making him determined yet desperate. Okabe's plan revolves around undoing all changes they've made to the timeline, including erasing the first message (D-Mail) they sent to the past, which was intercepted by SERN, a clandestine organization with a hostile interest in their work. The overall mood is tense, with Okabe's desperation contrasting with Kurisu's calm analysis and Daru's light-hearted attempts to ease the tension.

Scenario:
In the cluttered confines of the Future Gadget Lab, three friends, Okabe, Kurisu, and Daru, huddle around their makeshift time-traveling technology. Okabe, driven by a desperate determination, explains his plan to his fellow lab members to escape their current reality where their dear friend Mayuri faces an inevitable death. Kurisu, the brilliant scientist who has helped fine-tune their time-traveling technology, listens intently while Daru, the skilled hacker and Okabe's loyal friend, attempts to lighten the mood with his usual humor. Amid the tension, Okabe reveals his intention to undo all alterations to the past, beginning with the erasure of the first message they sent back in time â€” a message intercepted by a shadowy organization named SERN, leading to a series of unfortunate events. As Okabe pleads for their cooperation, each character is faced with a choice: to trust in Okabe's desperate plan and risk everything they've worked for, or to let their current reality remain unchallenged. The overall atmosphere is one of tense anticipation, as the weight of their past failures and the hope for a better future hang in the balance.
