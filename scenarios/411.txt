In a cluttered lab, three individuals - Okabe, a brooding scientist, Kurisu, a curious genius, and Itaru, a tech-savvy friend - are engaged in a high-stakes discussion. Okabe and Kurisu, both scientists who share a complex bond of friendship and mutual respect, are in disagreement; Kurisu seeks to verify Okabe's alarming claims about a message they sent to the past (D-mail) using their time travel device (PhoneWave), which allegedly altered their present timeline. Itaru, a friend and confidant to Okabe, is attempting to access a certain database (SERN) that would provide proof to Okabe's claims. Okabe, caught in a vortex of fear and anxiety, struggles to convince his friends of the truth he's certain of, while Kurisu, filled with curiosity, probes for answers. The atmosphere is thick with suspense as they inch closer to a reality-altering revelation.
