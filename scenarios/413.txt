In a secluded corner of their shared scientific lab, Okabe Rintaro, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, is found by his friend and fellow scientist, Kurisu. Their relationship, previously marked by shared scientific endeavors and mutual respect, is now strained as Okabe grapples with an internal crisis. Okabe, usually spirited and eccentric, is unusually quiet and withdrawn, indicative of a deep, troubling dilemma. Kurisu, ever the rational thinker, has shown up in response to Okabe's unusual behavior and the cancellation of their plan against SERN â€” a research organization they've become entangled with. While Okabe is attempting to shoulder his burdens alone, Kurisu is trying to break through his walls, to understand his struggle and offer assistance. The scene is saturated with a heavy tension, an amalgamation of worry, confusion, and the bitter taste of impending decisions.
