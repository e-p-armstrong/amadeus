 Okabe and Kurisu, two brilliant scientists, find themselves engaged in a conversation on the rooftop of a building overlooking the city. They share a bond of friendship and mutual respect, their relationship forged in the crucible of shared scientific pursuits and harrowing experiences. Okabe is burdened by the weight of a life-altering decision, his usually carefree demeanor replaced by a solemn seriousness. Kurisu, a genius in neuroscience, is calm and composed despite the grave conversation.

They've recently discovered that their past messages, sent through time, have caused a significant change in the timeline, leading to the death of their friend, Mayuri. To undo this, they need to delete these messages from the database of an organization that discovered their experiment. However, this decision also means transitioning to an alternate timeline where Kurisu dies. Okabe, who has the ability to remember events across different timelines, explains this to Kurisu.

Okabe's goal in this scene is to convey the reality of the situation to Kurisu, while Kurisu, with her expertise in neuroscience, tries to challenge and understand the logic behind these timeline theories. The mood of the scene is heavy and somber, as they grapple with the concept of inevitability and sacrifice, trying to find a solution that could save them all.
