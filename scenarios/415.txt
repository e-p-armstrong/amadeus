In a shared lab filled with the remnants of their scientific endeavors, two friends and fellow scientists, Okabe Rintaro and Kurisu Makise, are caught in a gripping conversation. Okabe, burdened by the knowledge that he may have to sacrifice Kurisu to prevent a catastrophic future event, is grappling with his emotions. Kurisu, on the other hand, calmly introduces a new hypothesis: the existence of parallel worlds, an idea that could radically alter the path they're on. She's trying to justify her own potential death and give Okabe some reprieve, using the concept of multiple realities to argue that even if she dies in one world, she could still exist in another. The mood is heavy with tension as Okabe wrestles with this daring theory and the young woman's calm acceptance of her possible fate.
