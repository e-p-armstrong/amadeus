Scenario:

In a room filled with scientific equipment, Okabe and Kurisu, two close friends who have bonded over their shared experiences with a dangerous and unpredictable time machine, are engaged in a tense conversation. Okabe, known for his eccentric persona, is unusually silent, while Kurisu, a genius scientist, tries to maintain a semblance of normalcy. Their conversation is interrupted by a phone call from Mayuri, a friend who is blissfully unaware of the impending danger and the burden they carry. Mayuri, usually cheerful and carefree, is sounding unusually serious, expressing her concern for Okabe's well-being and subtly hinting that she feels left out. In this scene, Okabe is trying to protect Mayuri from the harsh reality of their situation but is torn between his need to protect her and his desire to confide in her. The mood is tense and heavy with unspoken words and hidden emotions.
