 On a quiet day in their shared laboratory, Okabe and Mayuri, long-time friends and fellow researchers, look back on the past while facing an uncertain future. They have grown from a duo to a group of eight, including the brilliant Kurisu, whom they both admire. Okabe, burdened by the knowledge of the havoc their time-travel experiments have wreaked, grapples with a heart-wrenching decision: save Mayuri, his childhood friend, or save Kurisu, the newcomer who's become integral to their team. As Mayuri fondly recalls the early days of their lab and praises the dynamics of the now-expanded group, Okabe wrestles silently with his predicament, acutely aware of the paradox of time travel they've discovered, i.e., sending messages—D-Mails—to their past selves can change the present, but always at a cost. His goal in this scene is to protect his friends from the painful realities of their experiments, whilst Mayuri's innocent reminiscing serves as a poignant reminder of simpler times. The mood of the scene is bittersweet, steeped in nostalgia and colored by looming dread.
