In a quiet cemetery, amidst the stone memorials and silent prayers, Mayuri and Okabe, two close friends, are paying respects at Mayuri's grandmother's grave. Their bond is strong and complex, with Okabe often referring to Mayuri as his "hostage" in his world of pretend conspiracies and secret organizations. The air is thick with unspoken worries; Mayuri, feeling isolated and burdened, expresses her loneliness and fear of being a nuisance, while Okabe, visibly stressed, strives to reassure her. His current preoccupation, unbeknownst to Mayuri, is a desperate struggle to alter the course of time and prevent her impending death. As the conversation unfolds, both reach out to each other - Mayuri seeking reassurance and Okabe offering comfort - their shared strength standing as their shield against the melancholy that surrounds them.
