 The scene unfolds on a rooftop where Okabe finds Kurisu lying down, alone and deep in thought. They are both scientists who have been working together on a machine that can send messages to the past. Their shared experiences have brought them closer as friends, but a heavy decision rests on Okabe's shoulders: his next action could dictate whether Kurisu lives or dies. As Okabe approaches Kurisu, an unexpected rain shower forces them to move inside a nearby building. Okabe's goal is to check on Kurisu and perhaps discuss the situation they find themselves in, while Kurisu appears to be wrestling with the reality of her potential fate. The atmosphere is tense and somber, yet punctuated by their usual banter, reflecting their complex relationship in the face of an uncertain future."
