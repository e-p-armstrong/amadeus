In a secluded, dimly lit stairwell, scientist friends Okabe and Kurisu find themselves in a deep discussion. Both have been through a series of shared experiences and discoveries, chiefly the accidental creation of a device - a modified microwave - that can send text messages to the past, affecting the present. Okabe, desperate and burdened, grapples with a harsh reality: to save his friend Mayuri from a destined death, he must undo the effects of these messages, which will result in Kurisu's death. Kurisu, troubled by her fragmented memories and the potential reality she faces, insists that Mayuri must be saved, despite her own fear of being left alone in the current timeline. The scene is tense, filled with desperation and a looming sense of loss as both characters struggle to face the daunting choices before them.
