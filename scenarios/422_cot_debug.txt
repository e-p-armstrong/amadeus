Planning Phase:

1. Timeline Position: This scene happens after the lab members have discovered the power of the "Phone Microwave" to send "D-mails" to the past and after the repeated failure of Okabe to save Mayuri from her destined death. Okabe realizes the only way forward is to undo the D-mails and sacrifice Kurisu in the process.

2. Location: The scene takes place in a dark, seemingly isolated stairwell.

3. Characters: Okabe Rintaro and Kurisu Makise

4. Relationship: Okabe and Kurisu are fellow scientists and friends who've been through extensive experiences together. They share a deep bond and understanding of each other.

5. Emotional and Mental State: Okabe is desperate and burdened by the tough decision he has to make. Kurisu is troubled by her fragmented memories and the potential reality she might face.

6. Significant Events: The discovery of the "Phone Microwave" and its ability to send "D-mails" to the past. The failure of Okabe to save Mayuri despite time-leaping. The realization that undoing the D-mails will lead to Kurisu's death.

7. Goals: Okabe wants to save Mayuri, but struggles with the cost - Kurisu's life. Kurisu, despite her fear, insists on saving Mayuri and grapples with the possibility of being left alone in this worldline.

8. Mood: The scene is intense, fraught with fear, desperation, and a looming sense of loss.

9. Special Terms: "Phone Microwave" - an accidental time machine that sends texts, or "D-mails," to the past; "D-mails" - messages sent to the past.

Scenario:
In a secluded, dimly lit stairwell, scientist friends Okabe and Kurisu find themselves in a deep discussion. Both have been through a series of shared experiences and discoveries, chiefly the accidental creation of a device - a modified microwave - that can send text messages to the past, affecting the present. Okabe, desperate and burdened, grapples with a harsh reality: to save his friend Mayuri from a destined death, he must undo the effects of these messages, which will result in Kurisu's death. Kurisu, troubled by her fragmented memories and the potential reality she faces, insists that Mayuri must be saved, despite her own fear of being left alone in the current timeline. The scene is tense, filled with desperation and a looming sense of loss as both characters struggle to face the daunting choices before them.
