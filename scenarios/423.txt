Inside a dimly lit room, Okabe and Kurisu seek shelter from a storm that rages outside, their clothes soaked from the rain. The two of them, fellow scientists and friends, share a deep bond forged through shared experiences and scientific discovery. Okabe, struggling with a difficult decision, is in a state of turmoil. Kurisu, equally distressed, displays an unwavering resolve. Earlier, they had made a chilling realization: to save their friend Mayuri, they must undo the first message they had sent back in time, but doing so would result in Kurisu's death. Kurisu is determined to ensure Mayuri's survival, even if it means sacrificing herself, and is trying to convince Okabe to accept this. Okabe, however, is grappling with the devastating choice between saving one friend or the other. The mood is intense and emotional as they confront their grim reality.
