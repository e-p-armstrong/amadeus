Scenario:
In a quiet, secluded space, Okabe Rintaro and the brilliant Kurisu find themselves alone, their usual scientific banter replaced by a tense silence. The two scientists, bound by shared intellectual pursuits and a complex, unspoken affection, are caught in a moment of emotional turmoil. Okabe, desperate and distraught, struggles with a gut-wrenching decision that could alter the course of their lives, while Kurisu grapples with the fear of being forgotten. The discovery of a way to change the timeline—a worldline—has cast a grim shadow over their work, forcing Okabe to weigh his deepening feelings for Kurisu against the life of their friend Mayuri. As the darkness outside mirrors the heaviness in their hearts, Okabe musters the courage to confess his love, while Kurisu seeks assurance that she will remain in his memories, regardless of the worldline they end up in. The atmosphere is tense, charged with fear, longing, and the agony of choices yet to be made.
