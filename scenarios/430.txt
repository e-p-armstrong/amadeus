In a crowded laboratory filled with makeshift technology, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, stands with his friends Mayuri and Daru. Okabe shares a deep bond with Kurisu, a fellow scientist who is not currently present but whose absence hangs heavy in the room. As Okabe prepares to initiate a drastic sequence of events, he is resolute yet tinged with sadness. His friends, unaware of the true weight of the moment, watch with anticipation. Okabe has decided to activate their homemade device, the PhoneWave, originally designed for time alteration purposes, to rewrite reality and hopefully save their friend Mayuri's life. This decision, however, comes with the heart-wrenching cost of erasing Kurisu, their fellow Lab Mem (short for Laboratory Member), from their timeline. The mood in the room is bittersweet, a mix of hope and regret, as Okabe sets the wheels of change in motion.
