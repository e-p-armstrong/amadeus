 In their shared lab, a place of many shared experiences and breakthroughs, Okabe, Mayuri, and Daru are gathered. Okabe, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist," is trying to hide his pain under a facade of triumph, while his friends, Mayuri and Daru, watch on, concerned. Okabe and Mayuri share a close bond, almost like siblings, and he's been trying to protect her through their scientific exploits. Okabe is still reeling from recent events, having had to make difficult decisions to keep his friends safe, including sacrificing his blossoming relationship with a woman named Kurisu. At the start of the scene, Okabe is trying to maintain his facade, while Mayuri is attempting to reach out to him, to let him know it's okay to be vulnerable. The overall mood is a mix of victory and sorrow, a bittersweet triumph.
