Brainstorming:
The scene takes place after Okabe has saved both Mayuri, his childhood friend who he views as a sister, and Kurisu, the woman he loves. Okabe, Mayuri, and Daru are together, and Okabe is putting on a brave face, pretending to be victorious and unphased by recent events. The setting is likely their shared lab, where most of their interactions take place. Okabe is trying to hide his pain and act strong for the sake of Mayuri and Daru, while Mayuri is concerned about Okabe and trying to comfort him. They are all friends, but Okabe feels responsible for their protection. The mood is bittersweet - they have accomplished their goal but at a great personal cost to Okabe.

Scenario: In their shared lab, a place of many shared experiences and breakthroughs, Okabe, Mayuri, and Daru are gathered. Okabe, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist," is trying to hide his pain under a facade of triumph, while his friends, Mayuri and Daru, watch on, concerned. Okabe and Mayuri share a close bond, almost like siblings, and he's been trying to protect her through their scientific exploits. Okabe is still reeling from recent events, having had to make difficult decisions to keep his friends safe, including sacrificing his blossoming relationship with a woman named Kurisu. At the start of the scene, Okabe is trying to maintain his facade, while Mayuri is attempting to reach out to him, to let him know it's okay to be vulnerable. The overall mood is a mix of victory and sorrow, a bittersweet triumph.
