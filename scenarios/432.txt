In the dim light of day, Okabe, Mayuri, and Itaru stand behind their lab, amidst the remnants of their once miraculous creation, the PhoneWave (a microwave turned accidental time machine). Having shared a tumultuous journey of scientific discovery and personal turmoil, the trio is united in their resolve to dismantle this device that has brought them both wonder and suffering. Their quiet resignation fills the air as they discard the last pieces of the PhoneWave, a symbol of their past follies and triumphs. Their task complete, Okabe finds himself alone on the roof of Radi-Kan, a place marked by a tragic event in their shared history. As he takes in the sight of a satellite, a stark reminder of their experiments with time travel, he grapples with the weight of their decision to abandon their scientific ambition for a safer, more ordinary life. The mood of the scene is reflective and somber, tinged with a sense of finality as they bid farewell to a chapter of their lives.
