This scene seems to occur after the events of the main narrative where Okabe and his friends have discovered the dangerous implications of time travel and have decided to dismantle their time machine, the PhoneWave. The characters present in the scene are Okabe, Mayuri, and Itaru, who have been close friends and partners in their scientific endeavors. They have a strong bond but are dealing with the aftermath of their time travel experiments. They are likely feeling a mixture of relief and sadness as they dismantle the machine that brought them both joy and pain. The scene takes place in two locations: first, behind the lab where they are disposing of the remnants of the PhoneWave, and then at the roof of Radi-Kan, a building where a significant event (a murder) took place. The characters' goals in this scene are to put the past behind them and move on to a future without time travel. The overall mood of the scene is somber and reflective.

Having shared a tumultuous journey of scientific discovery and personal turmoil, the trio is united in their resolve to dismantle this device that has brought them both wonder and suffering. Their quiet resignation fills the air as they discard the last pieces of the PhoneWave, a symbol of their past follies and triumphs. Their task complete, Okabe finds himself alone on the roof of Radi-Kan, a place marked by a tragic event in their shared history.
