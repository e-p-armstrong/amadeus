In a room filled with odd gadgets and scientific equipment, Okabe, Mayuri, and Itaru find themselves in an intense confrontation with Suzuha, an apparent time traveler who seems familiar yet different. These three friends, co-founders of this makeshift lab, share a history of altering timelines to prevent a dystopian future, but now face a startling revelation from Suzuha. Suddenly, their past victories seem pointless as Suzuha unveils a future where a World War, fueled by the race for time travel technology, decimates humanity. Suzuha, driven by the urgency of her mission, implores Okabe to help her prevent this devastating future. Okabe, feeling overwhelmed and betrayed, vehemently refuses her request, while a concerned Mayuri tries to comfort him and the startled Itaru struggles to understand. The scene sways between shock, disbelief, and a desperate need to reverse the impending doom.
