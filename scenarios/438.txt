Inside a time machine perched on a building's rooftop, Okabe, a scientist versed in sending memories to the past — a process known as 'time leap' — finds himself about to embark on his first physical journey through time, guided by the time-traveler Suzuha. Okabe and Suzuha share a mutual respect, albeit with a slightly strained rapport due to the seriousness of their mission. Suzuha exudes an air of confidence and authority, while Okabe is filled with apprehension, his mind racing to process the gravity of the task ahead. Prior to this, they have been making preparations and going over the mission objective — to prevent the death of their colleague and friend, Makise Kurisu. The scene is awash with intense focus and nervous anticipation, as they finalize their preparations, ready to risk everything to alter a tragic fate.
