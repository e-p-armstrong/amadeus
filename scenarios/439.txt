 
Inside a confined, makeshift time machine, Okabe and Suzuha sit, their bodies secured by car-like seatbelts. Friends and teammates, they share a mission heavy with risk and uncertainty, their goal to prevent the death of a mutual friend, Kurisu, and avert the onset of World War Three. Okabe, anxious and somewhat bewildered, is guided by the calm and knowledgeable Suzuha, a time-traveler with first-hand experience of the timeline's perils. Their discussion touches upon the dubious involvement of Doctor Nakabachi, who plagiarized a time travel theory from Suzuha and whose actions inadvertently lead to global conflict. As they prepare to embark on their mission, the air between them is fraught with tension and hope, their emotions mirroring the precarious balance of the world's future.
