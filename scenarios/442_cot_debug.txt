Brainstorming: 
The scene seems to happen after Okabe has time-traveled and managed to save both his friends, Mayuri and Kurisu. The scene takes place in a building where a presentation is being held. Okabe has just come down from the roof and runs into Kurisu, who doesn't recognize him due to the timeline alterations. Okabe is emotional and conflicted, torn between his love for Kurisu and the pain of knowing she doesn't recognize him. He recalls the countless times he failed to save Mayuri and fears the same fate for Kurisu. His goal, it seems, is to somehow prevent Kurisu's death once again.

Scenario:
In a building hosting a presentation, Okabe Rintaro, a scientist with a knack for time-travel, encounters Kurisu, a fellow scientist and the woman he loves. They've met in different timelines before, but in this one, Kurisu doesn't recognize him. Okabe, struggling with his emotions, tries to act as a stranger while memories of their shared past haunt him. He is reminded of the countless times he has tried and failed to save his friend Mayuri in other timelines, fueling his fear and resolve to save Kurisu. The overall mood of the scene is tense and melancholic, filled with unspoken love, fear, and the weight of decisions that could alter timelines. Okabe's goal is to somehow change the course of events to prevent Kurisu's death, while Kurisu, oblivious to her impending danger, is simply trying to understand the strange man before her.
