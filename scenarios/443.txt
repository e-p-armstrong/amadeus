 In a nondescript presentation room, Okabe finds himself observing a tense interaction between Kurisu, a brilliant scientist who recently joined his research team, and Dr. Nakabachi, a physicist giving a controversial talk on time travel. Okabe, initially there as a skeptic, is now grappling with the shocking revelation that Kurisu and Nakabachi are estranged father and daughter. Kurisu, who has always shown a disdain for time travel, is about to present her own thesis on the subject to her dismissive father. Meanwhile, Okabe is trying to piece together their relationship and the implications of Kurisuâ€™s work, unsure of whether he should intervene. The room is thick with suspense as two worlds collide, personal and scientific, with the potential to unravel the fabric of their reality.
