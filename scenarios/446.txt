In the stark, echoing hallway of a modern building, Okabe, a brilliant yet eccentric scientist, finds himself in a horrifying predicament, his friend Kurisu, a fellow scientist, grievously injured at his hands while her estranged father, Nakabachi, flees with her stolen thesis. Okabe stands in shock, his mind a whirlwind of guilt and disbelief, paralyzed by the sight of Kurisu's life draining away before his eyes. His desperate wish is to aid her, yet he is frozen in horror, his hands rendered useless by his overwhelming guilt. Suzuha, a friend and ally, enters the scene, her goal to snap Okabe out of his stupor and incite action. As the blood pools and the life ebbs away, the scene is one of unthinkable tragedy, the air pulsing with palpable tension and raw emotion as desperation and anguish take hold.
