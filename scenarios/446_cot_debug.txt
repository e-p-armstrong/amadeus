Brainstorm: 
1. The scene takes place in a hallway, where a confrontation has just occurred. The characters present are Okabe, Kurisu, Nakabachi (who has just fled), and Suzuha. 
2. Okabe and Kurisu are close friends and fellow scientists. Suzuha is a friend and ally. Nakabachi is Kurisu's father but is antagonistic. 
3. Okabe is in shock and disbelief, unable to act. Kurisu is severely injured and fading fast. Suzuha is frantic and action-oriented. 
4. Okabe has accidentally stabbed Kurisu while trying to prevent Nakabachi from stealing her thesis. In this scene, he is struggling to process what has happened and is unable to help Kurisu. 
5. Okabe's goal is to save Kurisu but he is frozen in shock. Kurisu's goal is to survive. Suzuha's goal is to pull Okabe out of his shock and get him moving. 
6. The overall mood of the scene is tragic, chaotic, and tense.
7. This seems to be one continuous scene, rather than multiple.
8. There are no specific Steins;Gate terms to define.

Scenario:
In the stark, echoing hallway of a modern building, Okabe, a brilliant yet eccentric scientist, finds himself in a horrifying predicament, his friend Kurisu, a fellow scientist, grievously injured at his hands while her estranged father, Nakabachi, flees with her stolen thesis. Okabe stands in shock, his mind a whirlwind of guilt and disbelief, paralyzed by the sight of Kurisu's life draining away before his eyes. His desperate wish is to aid her, yet he is frozen in horror, his hands rendered useless by his overwhelming guilt. Suzuha, a friend and ally, enters the scene, her goal to snap Okabe out of his stupor and incite action. As the blood pools and the life ebbs away, the scene is one of unthinkable tragedy, the air pulsing with palpable tension and raw emotion as desperation and anguish take hold.
