In the aftermath of a failed mission to alter a tragic event, time-traveler Okabe finds himself back at his lab, surrounded by his friends Suzuha, Mayuri, and Itaru. These friends, bound together by their shared experiences with time travel, are a makeshift family. Okabe is filled with despair, guilt, and regret, having just returned from a failed attempt to save the life of their fellow scientist, Kurisu, only to inadvertently cause her death himself. This is not his first experience with such failure; he has previously tried and failed multiple times to save their friend Mayuri, leading him to the belief that certain events are predestined and unchangeable. As Okabe grapples with his guilt, Suzuha attempts to comfort and encourage him, Mayuri and Itaru express concern and confusion, and all of them are trying to make sense of the tragic turn of events. The overall mood of the scene is one of despair and helplessness, as they struggle to navigate the grim reality of their situation.
