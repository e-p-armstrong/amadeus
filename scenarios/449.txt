 
In the Future Gadget Laboratory, mad scientist Okabe, time traveler Suzuha, his childhood friend Mayuri, and technophile Itaru, also known as Daru, are puzzled by an unexpected D-Mail â€” a message sent from the future. The surprise is palpable across the room; Suzuha, despite being from the future, seems taken aback. Okabe, always the deep thinker, is trying to connect the dots between the D-Mail and Suzuha's timeline. Meanwhile, Daru has just returned from the convenience store, unaware of the tension in the room. The D-Mail triggers a news report about a plane fire and a Japanese physicist seeking asylum in Russia, a man Okabe recognizes as Dr. Nakabachi. Each lab member is trying to make sense of this surprising D-Mail and its potential implications. The atmosphere is thick with suspense and confusion as they grapple with the unfolding mystery.
