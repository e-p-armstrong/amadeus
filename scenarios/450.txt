 Okabe, Mayuri, Itaru, and Suzuha, a group of friends and fellow scientists, are in their lab watching a video revealing the unexpected location of Mayuri's lost toy, a rare metal mascot. Okabe, the main character, is in shock, his disbelief giving way to realization as he understands the implications of the toy's location, while Mayuri is upset about her lost toy, and Itaru, surprised and confused. Suzuha, a time-traveler from the future, is regretful and apologetic, knowing more than she initially let on. The video they are watching is a catalyst for their realization of the consequences of their ability to send messages to the past, a discovery they made earlier which now seems to be having undesirable effects. The mood is tense, filled with shock, disbelief, and confusion as they try to piece together the implications of their actions.
