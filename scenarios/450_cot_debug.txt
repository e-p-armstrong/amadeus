Scenario: Okabe, Mayuri, Itaru, and Suzuha, a group of friends and fellow scientists, are in their lab watching a video revealing the unexpected location of Mayuri's lost toy, a rare metal mascot. Okabe, the main character, is in shock, his disbelief giving way to realization as he understands the implications of the toy's location, while Mayuri is upset about her lost toy, and Itaru, surprised and confused. Suzuha, a time-traveler from the future, is regretful and apologetic, knowing more than she initially let on.
