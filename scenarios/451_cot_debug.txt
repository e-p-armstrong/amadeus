7. The lines shown cover one continuous scene, so the emotions remain consistent throughout.

Special terms:
1. D-Mail: A text message sent to the past using their time travel technology.
2. SERN: A large research organization that has been pursuing Okabe and his friends for their time travel technology.
3. PhoneWave: The name of their time travel device.

Scenario:
In Okabe's cluttered lab, Okabe, Mayuri, and Itaru huddle around a small phone screen, watching a video message sent from Okabe's future self. As close friends and fellow researchers, they've been through many time travel experiments together, and now they face a message from the future, a result of their shared work. Okabe, still reeling from his recent failure to save Kurisu, his love interest, is eager yet apprehensive to hear what his future self has to say. The video message, sent much like their D-mails, or text messages to the past, outlines a plan to change the timeline and save Kurisu, a plan born out of fifteen years of research and struggle. The lab is filled with tension and anticipation as Okabe, Mayuri, and Itaru strive to understand the message and prepare to take the steps outlined in it.
