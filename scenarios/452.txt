 In the cluttered, gadget-filled Future Gadget Laboratory, Okabe Rintaro, the self-proclaimed mad scientist, is gathered with his closest friends: the cheerful Mayuri, the hacker Itaru, and the time-traveler Suzuha. Through the ups and downs of their shared experiences, they have formed a bond that is both deep and complex. Okabe, usually brooding, is now filled with a manic energy, having just realized a way to save his dear friend Kurisu without altering their current timeline too drastically. He explains his plan to recreate the circumstances of Kurisu's "death", an event he had previously witnessed, without actually causing her demise. As he embraces his delusional alter-ego, he also discusses the need to destroy a crucial document that could lead to catastrophic events in the future. While Mayuri and Itaru find amusement in Okabe's antics, Suzuha is dead serious, underscoring the gravity of their mission. The mood of the scene is a mixture of hope, determination, and humor as Okabe and his friends prepare for the monumental task ahead.
