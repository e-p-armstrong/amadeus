The rooftop of a building serves as a makeshift base for a group of friends - Okabe, Suzuha, Mayuri, and Itaru - as they prepare for an important mission. The bonds between them are strong - Okabe, the audacious leader, and Suzuha, the resolute time-traveler, work together with Mayuri, the cheerful supporter, and Itaru, the calm tech whiz. The atmosphere is a mix of tension and determination as they plan for Operation Skuld, a mission to prevent a future war by faking the death of their friend Kurisu. The conversation revolves around the use of a glow stick, known as the Cyalume Saber, which they plan to use as a stand-in for blood in their plan. Each character is focused on their role - Okabe is strategizing, Suzuha is preparing for the mission, Mayuri is fetching necessary items, and Itaru is providing technical knowledge. The mood is serious, but there is a glimmer of hope as they prepare to change the future.
