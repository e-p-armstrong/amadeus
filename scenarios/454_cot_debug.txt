Scenario: 
In a moment filled with tension and hope, Okabe Rintarou is about to embark on a time-travelling mission with Suzuha, his friend and comrade. They are inside a time machine, prepared for a journey that could change the course of the future. Outside, Mayuri, another close friend, watches them with worry etched on her face. Okabe, usually flamboyant and eccentric, is surprisingly calm and resolute, his mind heavy with the memories of his past failures and the desire to correct them. The goal of this mission is clear: Okabe wishes to deceive himself and the world, aiming to merge different timelines into a single, favorable future, while Suzuha assists him as the operator of the time machine. Mayuri, though anxious, offers words of encouragement, expressing her earnest wish for Okabe's safe return. The air is heavy with the gravity of their task, and the scene is steeped in a serious, yet hopeful atmosphere.
