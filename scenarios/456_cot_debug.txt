Scenario:

In the dimly lit hallway of an event hall, hidden behind a stack of cardboard boxes, Okabe Rintaro listens in on a conversation between his friend, Kurisu, and her estranged father, Nakabachi. Though Kurisu and Okabe have worked together closely, Nakabachi remains an irritable presence in Kurisu's life. Okabe, prepared to intervene with a "Cyalume Saber," a single-use tool filled with fake blood meant to create a distraction, is filled with tension as he waits for the right moment to act. Kurisu, despite her father's evident displeasure, attempts to engage him in a discussion about time travel, a topic they've both extensively explored. As the dialogue progresses, Okabe's plan to protect Kurisu by scaring off Nakabachi with the Saber hangs in the balance, creating a suspenseful atmosphere that fills the scene.
