 In a tense atmosphere laden with resentment and defiance, Okabe, Kurisu, and Nakabachi find themselves in a heated confrontation. Kurisu, a brilliant scientist, is accusing Nakabachi, her estranged father, of stealing her work. Nakabachi, fuelled by a deep-seated resentment towards Kurisu's talent, responds with violence. Okabe, a friend and fellow scientist, steps in to protect Kurisu, presenting himself with a confident and defiant persona, "Hououin Kyouma." As the confrontation escalates, the air thick with tension and suspense, each character is driven by their distinct goals: Kurisu seeking justice and truth, Nakabachi yearning for dominance and superiority, and Okabe, determined to keep Kurisu safe from harm.
