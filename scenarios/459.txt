 In an unspecified location, Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist, finds himself gravely wounded with Suzuha, a close ally, by his side. Okabe and Suzuha share a mutual concern and respect for each other, while Okabe shares a deeper bond with the unconscious Kurisu. Okabe is in intense pain from a self-inflicted wound, but is determined to use this as part of his plan, while Suzuha is frightened and worried for Okabe's life. Leading up to this point, Okabe has intentionally injured himself in a bid to alter reality and save Kurisu, laying the groundwork to deceive the world by creating a scene of a fake death using his own blood. Okabe is focused on executing his plan to save Kurisu and alter their predetermined fate, even at the risk of his own life, while Suzuha is concerned about preventing Okabe's seemingly imminent death. The overall mood of the scene is tense and filled with desperation, as Okabe clings to his plan amidst the pain and uncertainty.
