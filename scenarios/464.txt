 In an ordinary apartment that once housed their time travel experiments, Okabe Rintaro, a former 'mad scientist', is in conversation with Tennouji and Moeka, two people who were once entangled in his time travel operations. After resolving their past conflicts, they are trying to return to a normal life, with Okabe refusing Tennouji's request to assist Moeka in searching for an important device. On his return to the apartment, Okabe is met by his long-time friends, Mayuri and Itaru. They are living a peaceful life, marked by small moments such as Mayuri cooking using a microwave that was once a part of their time-travel device, the PhoneWave. Okabe, Mayuri and Itaru are trying to recapture their old camaraderie, while Okabe also attempts to maintain a peaceful relationship with Tennouji and Moeka. The overall mood of the scene is bittersweet, filled with nostalgia for a simpler past and relief for having escaped their dangerous adventures."
