Their bond, forged through shared experiences and scientific endeavors, is evident in their casual banter and shared laughter. However, Okabe's inner thoughts reveal his struggle: haunted by memories of alternate timelines, he is burdened with the knowledge of countless tragedies that his friends remain blissfully unaware of. He presents his friends with badges, tokens that symbolize their membership in the lab, triggering a light-hearted exchange about the mysterious initials inscribed on them. Okabe's goal is to protect this moment of peace, to keep Mayuri and Daru safe from the knowledge of the alternate timelines and the dangers they faced. Despite Okabe's inner turmoil, the overall mood of the scene is upbeat, underscored by the innocence of Mayuri and the enthusiasm of Daru.
