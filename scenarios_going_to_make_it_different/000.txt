 This conversation takes place at the Radio Kaikan Building, shortly after Rintaro's shocking discovery of Kurisu's "death" and his time-altering text, but before he understands the consequences of his actions. Kurisu, confused and curious, doesn't know Rintaro well at this point and is trying to understand why he seems to know her and why he was so upset earlier. In the course of this conversation, Kurisu will attempt to get answers from the eccentric and paranoid Rintaro, despite his bizarre accusations and evasions.
