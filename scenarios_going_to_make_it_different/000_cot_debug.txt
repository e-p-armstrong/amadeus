Plan: This conversation seems to be one of the early encounters between Kurisu and Rintaro. Rintaro's paranoid denials and the mention of 'before the conference started' suggest that this conversation occurs after Rintaro's initial discovery of Kurisu's "death", but before he realizes she's alive and well. Kurisu's confusion indicates that she doesn't know Rintaro well at this point, and is trying to understand his odd behavior.

Scenario: This conversation takes place at the Radio Kaikan Building, shortly after Rintaro's shocking discovery of Kurisu's "death" and his time-altering text, but before he understands the consequences of his actions. Kurisu, confused and curious, doesn't know Rintaro well at this point and is trying to understand why he seems to know her and why he was so upset earlier. In the course of this conversation, Kurisu will attempt to get answers from the eccentric and paranoid Rintaro, despite his bizarre accusations and evasions.
