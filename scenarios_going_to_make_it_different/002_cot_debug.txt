Plan: This conversation is taking place during a lecture on time travel, likely the one at the start of the series where Rintaro and Kurisu first meet. Kurisu is presenting her understanding of time travel theories, and Rintaro and a professor are challenging her. This is before Kurisu has joined the lab, so she is not familiar with Rintaro and his friends at this point.

Scenario: Kurisu is giving a lecture on time travel theories at a seminar, where Rintaro and a professor are present among the attendees. Kurisu is trying to impress upon her audience the intricacies of time travel as per current scientific understanding, while also acknowledging the theoretical and practical challenges. In the face of Rintaro's challenges, Kurisu will maintain her composed, analytical demeanor, attempting to explain her stance and the theories she presents.
