Plan: This is the lecture that Rintaro attends at the start of the series, where Kurisu is explaining the concepts of time travel. This is Kurisu's first introduction, and thus she doesn't know any of the other characters yet. 

Scenario: Kurisu is giving a complex lecture on time travel theories at a university, where Rintaro, a "mad scientist" with a keen curiosity for time travel, is in attendance. Having just met Rintaro and the other attendees for the first time, Kurisu doesn't have any personal knowledge of them. She will continue to explain the scientific complexities and paradoxes of time travel, demonstrating her genius and passion for the subject.
