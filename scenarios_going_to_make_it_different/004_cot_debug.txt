Plan: This conversation is taking place soon after Rintaro discovers that Kurisu is alive, which means it is early in the story. Kurisu has come to the lab to confront Rintaro about their earlier meeting, which he has no memory of. The conversation is tense and filled with confusion, as well as Rintaro's eccentric behavior.

Scenario: In the cluttered confines of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu has just arrived to confront Rintaro about their strange initial encounter. Kurisu, having only recently met Rintaro and Itaru, is still unsure about their character and motives, but she is determined to find out the truth. Kurisu, feeling both frustrated and curious, will confront Rintaro about his claims of her death, and will attempt to understand the nature of his experiments.
