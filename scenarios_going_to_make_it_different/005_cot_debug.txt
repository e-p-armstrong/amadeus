Plan: This conversation takes place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, shortly after Kurisu has discovered the strange properties of the PhoneWave and is now trying to understand it. It's a scene that happens after their first meeting at the time travel lecture and after Rintaro finds Kurisu alive and well. It's before Kurisu officially joins the lab, as indicated by Rintaro's insistence that she become a "lab mem".

Scenario: Having stumbled upon the Future Gadget Laboratory and the eccentric team within, Kurisu is curious about the bizarre phenomenon she has witnessed with the PhoneWave. She is familiar with Rintaro and Itaru, but they are still relatively new acquaintances and she's wary of their odd behavior. Determined to understand the strange device, Kurisu will reluctantly agree to Rintaro's terms, joining the lab and setting the stage for her deeper involvement in the unfolding time travel experiments.
