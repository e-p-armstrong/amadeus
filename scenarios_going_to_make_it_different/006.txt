 Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are intensely discussing the mysterious phenomena surrounding the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Kurisu, after only recently joining the lab, is still trying to grasp the formality of their experiments and getting accustomed to Rintaro's eccentricities. Eager to understand the PhoneWave's functions, Kurisu will push Rintaro and Itaru to run further experiments and provide her with more information, despite the playful banter and Rintaro's unusual nickname for her.
