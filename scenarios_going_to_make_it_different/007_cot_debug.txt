Plan: This conversation is taking place shortly after Rintaro discovers Kurisu alive, following his initial discovery of her in a pool of blood and the first activation of the Phone Microwave. The characters are discussing the events related to Doctor Nakabachi's presentation and the email Rintaro sent, which Kurisu recalls seeing. This suggests that Kurisu is just starting to get to know the other characters and understand the peculiar circumstances surrounding them.

Scenario: After the shocking twist of finding Kurisu alive, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru find themselves back at the Future Gadget Laboratory, trying to piece together the strange events surrounding Doctor Nakabachi's presentation. Although Kurisu is still relatively new to the group and the lab, she is starting to connect the dots about the mysterious email Rintaro sent. Kurisu will press for more information about the email and its implications, trying to uncover the truth behind her supposed death.
