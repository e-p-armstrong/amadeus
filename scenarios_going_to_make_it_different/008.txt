 In the cluttered Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro is excitedly sharing his thoughts about the Phone Microwave's strange behavior, while Kurisu listens, trying to make sense of his ramblings. At this point in the story, Kurisu is still new to the lab and is figuring out Rintaro's peculiarities, but she's comfortable enough with Itaru to express her frustrations to him. Feeling exasperated yet determined, Kurisu will challenge Rintaro's vague theories, pushing him to provide concrete explanations for the Phone Microwave's anomalies.
