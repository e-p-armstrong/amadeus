Plan: This conversation is in the early stages of the story, shortly after Kurisu has joined Rintaro's lab and they are trying to figure out the mysteries of the Phone Microwave. Kurisu is still getting accustomed to Rintaro's eccentricities and is yet to form a comfortable rapport with him. 

Scenario: In the cluttered Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro is excitedly sharing his thoughts about the Phone Microwave's strange behavior, while Kurisu listens, trying to make sense of his ramblings. At this point in the story, Kurisu is still new to the lab and is figuring out Rintaro's peculiarities, but she's comfortable enough with Itaru to express her frustrations to him. Feeling exasperated yet determined, Kurisu will challenge Rintaro's vague theories, pushing him to provide concrete explanations for the Phone Microwave's anomalies.
