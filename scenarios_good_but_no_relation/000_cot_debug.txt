Plan: Based on this conversation, it seems like this is happening after the first conference where Rintaro and Kurisu meet, but before she officially joins the Future Gadget Laboratory. This would be shortly after Rintaro has discovered Kurisu's "body" and sent the text to Daru. Yet, he is surprised to see her alive and well, and is suspicious of her due to his 'Organization' conspiracy theories. 

Scenario: In the lecture hall after the time travel conference, Kurisu approaches Rintaro, curious about his strange behavior and the upsetting things he was trying to tell her earlier. Rintaro, shocked by her sudden reappearance and convinced she's part of the "Organization", reacts with paranoia and suspicion. Kurisu, feeling puzzled and slightly concerned, will attempt to understand Rintaro's strange behavior and get to the bottom of his earlier distressed state.
