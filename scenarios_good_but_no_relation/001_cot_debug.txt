Plan: This conversation is the initial encounter between Rintaro and Kurisu at the time travel lecture, right after Rintaro has found Kurisu in a pool of blood and sent the text about her "death" to Itaru. The confusion and disbelief in Rintaro's responses makes this clear.

Scenario: After witnessing what he believes to be Kurisu's death and sending a panicked text to Itaru, Rintaro is stunned to find Kurisu alive and well at a lecture on time travel. His confusion is palpable and he is visibly struggling to make sense of the situation. This moment sets the stage for Kurisu's lecture on time travel, which she will deliver despite the unexpected interruption from a disoriented Rintaro.
