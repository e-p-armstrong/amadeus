 Kurisu is giving a lecture on time travel at a university, where Rintaro is among the audience. The lecture covers a range of theoretical models and includes a discussion on the potential of time travel to the future and past, based on Einstein's theory of relativity and the concept of cosmic strings respectively. Kurisu is trying to engage the audience and will continue to explain the complex theories in a way that's easy for them to understand.
