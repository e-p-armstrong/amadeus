Plan: This conversation seems to be happening during a lecture or academic discussion about time travel. Given Kurisu's expertise in physics and neuroscience, she is likely the one presenting or leading the discussion. It's early in the series, before Kurisu has joined the Future Gadget Laboratory, but after her initial encounter with Rintaro. 

Scenario: Kurisu is in the midst of a scientific discussion about the theory of time travel, likely during a lecture or seminar. She is explaining complex concepts of space-time physics to an audience that includes Rintaro and a number of other students or academics. Feeling confident and in her element, Kurisu will continue to elaborate on the intricacies and paradoxes of time travel, her tone both informative and dismissive of the possibility of practical time travel.
