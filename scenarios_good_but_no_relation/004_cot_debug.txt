Plan: This conversation happens right after Kurisu's first visit to the lab after her "death", and is the first time Rintaro sees her alive after having sent the first D-Mail. The humor and tension suggest that this is an early point in the series, before the consequences of the Phone Microwave have begun to manifest. 

Scenario: Following her non-fatal stabbing at the lecture, Kurisu visits the Future Gadget Laboratory to confront Rintaro about the strange encounter they had previously. Having just seen her in a pool of blood, Rintaro is shocked and terrified, and resorts to his eccentric 'mad scientist' persona to hide his confusion. Despite finding herself in a strange place with even stranger people, Kurisu remains composed and will try to get to the bottom of Rintaro's claims about her alleged death.
