Plan: This conversation refers to the very beginning of the series, as it mentions Doctor Nakabachi's presentation and the email Rintaro sent when he first found Kurisu's "corpse". This is the moment when Kurisu confronts Rintaro about their earlier meeting, which he doesn't remember.

Scenario: Following an unexpected reunion at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu finds herself in a heated discussion with Rintaro and Itaru about the series of strange events linked to Doctor Nakabachi's cancelled presentation. Feeling confused and slightly irritated, Kurisu is trying to make sense of Rintaro's claims about her supposed death, as stated in an email he sent. Determined to get to the bottom of it, Kurisu will press Rintaro for more details about the email and the inexplicable events surrounding their earlier encounter.
