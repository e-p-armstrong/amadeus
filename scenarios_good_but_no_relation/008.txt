 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are still grappling with the enigma of the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and its mysterious ability to send emails to the past. Rintaro, in an outburst of exhilaration, believes he's made a breakthrough, but Kurisu, ever the rational scientist, remains skeptical. Kurisu will challenge Rintaro to provide concrete proof of his theory, refusing to be swept up in his excitement without any solid evidence.
