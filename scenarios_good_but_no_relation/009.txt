 The Future Gadget Laboratory hums with the energy of a new discovery as Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri introduce Kurisu to the PhoneWave's surprising ability to send emails into the past. Although Kurisu is initially skeptical and annoyed by Rintaro's insistence on calling her his assistant, she can't hide her curiosity about their strange device. Despite her irritation, Kurisu will soon find herself deeply involved in the experiment, trying to unravel the mystery of the 'gelbanas', and arguing with Rintaro in their usual banter-filled manner.
