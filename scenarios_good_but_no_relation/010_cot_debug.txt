Plan: This conversation includes all four main characters, and it's about a significant event in the series when the group discovers the time-traveling capabilities of the PhoneWave. Given the pacing, the dialogue, and the characters' reactions, this scene likely takes place right after Rintaro and his friends have conducted an experiment with the PhoneWave that has had unexpected results.

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri have just witnessed a bizarre incident with the PhoneWave, altering the state of Mayuri's chicken and causing physical damage to the lab. The group, especially Kurisu, is shocked and trying to make sense of what has happened. In the ensuing conversation, Kurisu will question and challenge Rintaro's claim about the PhoneWave being a time machine, bringing her scientific skepticism to bear on the extraordinary discovery.
