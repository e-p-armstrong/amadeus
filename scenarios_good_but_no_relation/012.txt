 After several experiments with the PhoneWave (name subject to change) in the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu is still skeptical about the possibility of time travel, despite witnessing the phenomena.

As the conversation continues, Kurisu will be challenged by Rintaro to reassess her scientific beliefs and confront the fringe science they are dealing with.
