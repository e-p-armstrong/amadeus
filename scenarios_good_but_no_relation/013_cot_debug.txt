Plan: This conversation happens after Rintaro has discovered that Kurisu is alive and well, and after she has confronted him about their earlier meeting, which he has no memory of. They are arguing about the feasibility of time travel and the PhoneWave. Kurisu is also asking Rintaro to explain his earlier claim that she was stabbed.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are engaged in a heated debate about the nature and feasibility of time travel, with Rintaro advocating for its exploration and Kurisu vehemently against it due to her father's downfall in the scientific community. Kurisu is feeling frustrated and defensive, not only due to their disagreement but also because of Rintaro's previous claim that she was stabbed. In the following conversation, Kurisu will challenge Rintaro to explain his hallucination about her being stabbed, trying to make sense of his irrational claims while keeping her own emotions in check.
