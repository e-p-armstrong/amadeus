 Rintaro and Kurisu are at the Future Gadget Laboratory, in the midst of a typical day filled with playful banter and scientific discussions. Having been involved in Rintaro's experiments, Kurisu is now accustomed to his eccentric behavior but remains skeptical about his claims of hallucinations and SERN's involvement in time travel. Caught between curiosity and skepticism, Kurisu will engage Rintaro in a discussion about the mysterious retro PC, the IBN 5100, and its importance in uncovering SERN's secrets.
