Plan: This interaction occurs when Rintaro, Kurisu, and Luka are present. Given that Rintaro wants to talk to Luka's father about a matter that "concerns the future of mankind," it's likely that this is after the discovery of the Phone Microwave's capabilities, but before the crisis with SERN. Kurisu's frustration at Rintaro's introductions indicates a level of familiarity between them, but their relationship isn't fully developed yet.

Scenario: At Luka's residence, Rintaro and Kurisu are meeting Luka's father for an important discussion. Kurisu is frustrated with Rintaro's casual introduction of her as his 'assistant', feeling that it belittles her contributions to their work. In the ensuing conversation, Kurisu will insist on a proper introduction and continue to spar verbally with Rintaro, while navigating the cultural and social norms of Luka's household.
