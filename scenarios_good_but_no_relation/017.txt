 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Luka are tackling the task of moving a heavy piece of equipment, perhaps related to their time travel experiments. The trio's banter reflects their growing camaraderie, with Kurisu, initially resistant to helping with the physical labor, showing concern for Luka's willingness to help. Despite her protests, Kurisu will eventually give in to the situation, her stubbornness and concern for the others overriding her initial refusal to participate in the physical task.
