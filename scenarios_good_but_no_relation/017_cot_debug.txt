Plan: This is a conversation where Kurisu, Rintaro, and Luka interact in a more relaxed setting, likely at the Future Gadget Laboratory. The topic of conversation suggests they are in the middle of moving a heavy object, possibly related to their ongoing experiments. This seems to occur after Kurisu has joined the lab, given her reference to being made a lab member for her knowledge.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Luka are tackling the task of moving a heavy piece of equipment, perhaps related to their time travel experiments. The trio's banter reflects their growing camaraderie, with Kurisu, initially resistant to helping with the physical labor, showing concern for Luka's willingness to help. Despite her protests, Kurisu will eventually give in to the situation, her stubbornness and concern for the others overriding her initial refusal to participate in the physical task.
