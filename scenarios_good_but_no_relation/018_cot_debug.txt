Plan: The conversation starts with a surprising or startling event, likely related to Rintaro's eccentricities. The mention of a computer suggests that this might be the scene where Rintaro and Kurisu are transporting the IBN 5100 computer back to the lab. The tension between Suzuha and Kurisu suggests that this is before Suzuha's identity as a time traveler is revealed.

Scenario: In the bustling streets of Akihabara, Kurisu finds herself reluctantly assisting Rintaro in transporting the recently acquired IBN 5100 back to the Future Gadget Lab. While Kurisu is initially taken aback by Rintaro's antics and the physically demanding task, she eventually gives in, revealing a growing sense of camaraderie between the two. As they approach the lab, Kurisu is set to encounter an unexpected cold shoulder from Suzuha, leaving her confused and questioning the reason behind the hostility.
