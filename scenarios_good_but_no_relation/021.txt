 Back in the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro has just secured the elusive IBN 5100, a crucial piece of equipment necessary for their ongoing time travel research. Kurisu, initially unsure of what the fuss is about, finds herself facing an unexpected hostility from Suzuha, a part-time worker at the Braun Tube Workshop who she's never met before. Feeling confused and slightly irritated by the unexpected encounter, Kurisu will then be roped into helping Rintaro lug the hefty IBN 5100 into the lab.
