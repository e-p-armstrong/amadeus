Plan: Given the mention of the IBN 5100 and SERN, this conversation seems to be taking place after the lab members have discovered SERN's involvement in time travel research, but before any serious complications arise (like Mayuri's death). The interaction implies a degree of familiarity and camaraderie among the characters, suggesting that it's a point after Kurisu has fully integrated into the lab. 

Scenario: After another usual day at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu decides to stay behind as Mayuri and Luka leave. Amidst the playful banter and familiar arguments with Rintaro, Kurisu's curiosity regarding the IBN 5100 and SERN finally gets the better of her. Noticing a shift in the atmosphere, Kurisu will press Rintaro for answers to her questions, diving deeper into the mysteries of SERN and time travel.
