Plan: This conversation happens when Kurisu is trying to understand Rintaro's claims about the time travel experiments and SERN's involvement. This is after Kurisu has already joined the lab and is starting to get involved in the experiments. Given the mention of the IBN 5100, it's likely that this is after the lab members have discovered its importance for decrypting SERN's database.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu is attempting to understand the extent of Rintaro's claims about SERN's secret time travel research, and the role of the elusive IBN 5100 in decoding SERN's encrypted database. After being introduced to the lab's various inventions, she's becoming more invested in their work, but is still skeptical and demanding proof. While awaiting Itaru's decryption of SERN's database, Kurisu will insist on examining the PhoneWave (name subject to change) herself, eager to unravel the mystery behind its time-altering capabilities.
