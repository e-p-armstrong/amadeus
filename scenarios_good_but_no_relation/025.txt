 Back at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are deep in an experiment involving the strange PhoneWave, with Kurisu taking the lead in the inquiry while Rintaro provides necessary details about the device. She's intrigued and confused by the strange phenomena occurring, such as the gelification of bananas. Going forward, Kurisu will attempt to scientifically approach and rationalize the PhoneWave's irregular behavior, despite her initial skepticism about the concept of time travel.
