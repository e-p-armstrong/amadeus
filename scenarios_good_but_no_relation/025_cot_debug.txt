Plan: This conversation involves Kurisu and Rintaro discussing the PhoneWave and its operations. Given their discussion about the microwave settings and the gelification of bananas, this is likely during the period of the series where they are testing and trying to understand the PhoneWave's ability to send text messages to the past. This is before they recognize it as a time machine.

Scenario: Back at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are deep in an experiment involving the strange PhoneWave, with Kurisu taking the lead in the inquiry while Rintaro provides necessary details about the device. She's intrigued and confused by the strange phenomena occurring, such as the gelification of bananas. Going forward, Kurisu will attempt to scientifically approach and rationalize the PhoneWave's irregular behavior, despite her initial skepticism about the concept of time travel.
