Plan: This conversation is a little more serious, and is occuring when they're discussing SERN's plans. Given the mention of Hououin Kyouma, Kurisu's attempt to differentiate between Hououin and Okabe, and the fact that they're reading a document, it's likely the scene when Kurisu, Rintaro and Itaru are uncovering the depth of SERN's time-travel experiments in the lab. The document Kurisu is reading is SERN's report.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are huddled around a computer screen as they uncover the chilling details of SERN's time-travel experiments. Kurisu, torn between fear and a scientist's fascination, delves deeper into the disturbing report. Her calculated and focused demeanor will serve as a counterbalance to Rintaro's eccentric persona, as she continues to read out SERN's frightening plans.
