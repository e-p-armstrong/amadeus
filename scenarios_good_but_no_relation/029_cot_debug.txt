Plan: This conversation is very clearly happening after they've discovered SERN's dark secret, the Jellyman's Report. This is an intense and serious moment, as they're realizing the depth of SERN's human experimentation. Given Rintaro's insistence that Kurisu leave for her own good, this is likely immediately before they are raided by SERN. 

Scenario: After discovering the disturbing depth of SERN's human experimentation through the Jellyman's Report, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are in the Future Gadget Laboratory, grappling with the magnitude of what they've uncovered. Despite Rintaro's pleas for her to abandon their dangerous pursuit of the truth, Kurisu feels a strong sense of responsibility and refuses to back down. Resolute and determined, Kurisu is ready to delve further into the Jellyman's Report, bracing herself for the grim revelations to come.
