 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are pouring over the secret files they've hacked from SERN's database, discussing the physics behind SERN's time travel experiments, which involve the theoretical concept of Kerr black holes. Despite the gravity of their discoveries, their camaraderie shines through, with light-hearted banter interspersed between serious discussions. In the ensuing conversation, Kurisu will try to explain the complex science behind the time travel theory to the others, all while dealing with their constant, playful distractions.
