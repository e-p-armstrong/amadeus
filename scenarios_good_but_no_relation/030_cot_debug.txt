Plan: This conversation is centered around the team's discovery of SERN's secret files and their ongoing research into time travel theories, specifically those involving Kerr black holes. It is clear that they have already hacked into SERN's database and are now analyzing the information found therein. This places the scene after the time when they have discovered the ability to send emails to the past and after Kurisu had joined the lab.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are pouring over the secret files they've hacked from SERN's database, discussing the physics behind SERN's time travel experiments, which involve the theoretical concept of Kerr black holes. Despite the gravity of their discoveries, their camaraderie shines through, with light-hearted banter interspersed between serious discussions. In the ensuing conversation, Kurisu will try to explain the complex science behind the time travel theory to the others, all while dealing with their constant, playful distractions.
