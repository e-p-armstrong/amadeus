 In the heart of Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are deep into a discussion about the complex mechanics of time travel, specifically revolving around the concept of Kerr black holes and their potential for time travel. Kurisu is trying to explain this complicated theory to Rintaro and Itaru, and they are attempting to understand its implications for their ongoing investigation into SERN's mysterious experiments. Grappling with the challenge of translating advanced theoretical physics into practical application, Kurisu will continue to elucidate upon the role of black holes and singularities in time travel, while the team wrestles with the question of how SERN is manipulating these phenomena.
