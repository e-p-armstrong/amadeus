 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are in the thick of their time travel research, attempting to understand how SERN's technology works and how they can improve their own. Kurisu, feeling challenged and stimulated, is breaking down the massive problems they face, keenly aware of their limited resources compared to SERN. Moving forward, she will continue to critically challenge Rintaro's ideas and provide her own scientific insights, while also beginning to ponder how SERN is overcoming these same challenges.
