 Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri are gathered at the Future Gadget Laboratory, engaging in a discussion about SERN's time travel experiments and the functioning of their own PhoneWave. Kurisu, who has integrated herself into the lab as a member despite her initial hesitations, is trying to understand the anomalies associated with the PhoneWave. With her scientific knowledge, she will attempt to provide insights into SERN's challenges with time travel and how these could potentially be linked to the PhoneWave's unexpected time-travel capabilities.
