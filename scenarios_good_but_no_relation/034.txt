 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Itaru are knee-deep in a technical discussion about the mechanics of their newly discovered ability to send emails to the past using the PhoneWave. Kurisu is cautiously analytical about the phenomenon, while Rintaro is more bold and audacious in his conjectures. As the conversation progresses, Kurisu will attempt to steer the group towards a more practical naming convention for their discovery, inadvertently causing a humorous misunderstanding with Mayuri.
