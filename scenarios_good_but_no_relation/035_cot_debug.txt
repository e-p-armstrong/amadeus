Plan: This conversation presents a scenario where the group is working on the Phone Microwave, discussing its operation and the conditions under which it works. Given Kurisu's active involvement in the discussion and her suggestion to abbreviate to 'D-Mail', this scene likely takes place after she has joined the Future Gadget Laboratory. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri are huddled around the Phone Microwave, debating the mechanism of its operation and the naming of the emails it sends to the past. Having become a fully integrated member of the team, Kurisu is actively participating in these discussions, showing her sharp intellect and no-nonsense attitude. Amidst the banter and scientific debate, Kurisu will soon direct the team in a practical test of the PhoneWave, demonstrating her leadership qualities and commitment to the project.
