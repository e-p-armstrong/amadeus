Plan: This conversation is taking place after the group has started their D-Mail experiments, but before they've fully perfected the method. The extended conversation suggests a relatively relaxed atmosphere, despite the mention of "Killing Aura", so it's likely not during a crisis period. The conversation is in the Future Gadget Lab, with all main characters present and engaging in their usual banter. Kurisu seems to be taking a more proactive role in the experiments.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, after a series of D-Mail experiments, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are discussing their findings and future plans, while Mayuri brings lightness to the tense atmosphere with her innocent questions. Kurisu, despite being tired from the intense work, is determined to unravel the mysteries behind the D-Mails. Engaging in their usual mix of serious discussion and playful banter, Kurisu will focus on consolidating their findings and pushing the group to improve their experimental approach.
