Plan: This conversation has a lot of technical talk about the Phone Microwave and its limits, suggesting that they are in the process of refining and understanding the machine. This would take place after they've discovered the machine's time travel capabilities but before they have fully understood its workings. Given the characters present and the mention of SERN's lifter, this is likely during the mid-part of the series when they are trying to figure out how to control the PhoneWave, before the threat from SERN becomes imminent.

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are deep into a discussion about the operational limits of the PhoneWave and the technical problems surrounding data transmission through time. Kurisu is deep in thought, trying to crack the mystery of the PhoneWave's functionality, and her scientific curiosity is piqued. As the conversation progresses, Kurisu will be drawn more into the scientific puzzle, pushing them to delve deeper into the mysteries of their inadvertent time machine.
