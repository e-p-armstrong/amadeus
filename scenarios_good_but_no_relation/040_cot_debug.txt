Plan: This conversation indicates that the group has discovered the time travel capabilities of the PhoneWave, but they are still in the early stages of understanding how it works. This is likely a scene after Kurisu has joined the lab and they have begun experimenting with the PhoneWave, but before the full implications and dangers of their discovery have become apparent.

Scenario: In the cluttered space of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri are in a discussion about the unexpected time travel capabilities of the PhoneWave. Feeling overwhelmed and slightly frustrated by the uncertainty, Kurisu is trying to make sense of the accidental discovery. Contemplating the reality of time travel, Kurisu will soon head back to her hotel to rest and process the day's revelations.
