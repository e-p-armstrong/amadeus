 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, the group is planning to resume their experiments on the PhoneWave, despite previous complaints from their landlord, Mr. Braun, about the disturbances caused by their experiments. Kurisu, having fully integrated into the lab as a member, is acting as the voice of reason, questioning Rintaro's thought process. With a hint of skepticism, Kurisu will challenge Rintaro's logic and his overconfidence about their landlord situation, expressing her concern about the potential consequences of their disruptive experiments.
