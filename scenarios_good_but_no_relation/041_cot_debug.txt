Plan: This conversation is taking place inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, during the period when the group is experimenting with the PhoneWave. The mention of "the manager" and "shaking" suggests they're dealing with the landlord, Mr. Braun, who has previously scolded them for causing disturbances in the building due to their experiments. Kurisu's involvement suggests she's already joined Rintaro's lab, and her tone suggests she's growing comfortable with the group.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, the group is planning to resume their experiments on the PhoneWave, despite previous complaints from their landlord, Mr. Braun, about the disturbances caused by their experiments. Kurisu, having fully integrated into the lab as a member, is acting as the voice of reason, questioning Rintaro's thought process. With a hint of skepticism, Kurisu will challenge Rintaro's logic and his overconfidence about their landlord situation, expressing her concern about the potential consequences of their disruptive experiments.
