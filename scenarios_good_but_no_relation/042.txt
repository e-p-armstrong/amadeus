 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are engaged in a conversation about Suzuha's continuous work on her bike and her job at the CRT shop. They are in a relaxed period of their research, before the complications with SERN arise. In this conversation, Kurisu is about to get a grasp of Suzuha's odd behavior and her lack of knowledge about common things, such as her boss's nickname.
