 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Itaru, and Kurisu are debating the naming of the upgraded PhoneWave, while Mayuri and Moeka watch on. Kurisu, growing increasingly frustrated with the frivolity of her colleagues and their tendency to get sidetracked, is trying to keep them focused on the task at hand. Amid the bickering, Kurisu will be unwittingly goaded into a discussion about her personality traits, particularly her tsundere nature, as she tries to steer the group back towards their experiment.
