Plan: This conversation involves multiple characters and seems to be about an upgrade of the PhoneWave, which suggests it happens after they've discovered its time-travel abilities and Kurisu has joined the lab. The banter indicates they all are in a non-crisis moment, probably midway through the series. 

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Itaru, and Kurisu are debating the naming of the upgraded PhoneWave, while Mayuri and Moeka watch on. Kurisu, growing increasingly frustrated with the frivolity of her colleagues and their tendency to get sidetracked, is trying to keep them focused on the task at hand. Amid the bickering, Kurisu will be unwittingly goaded into a discussion about her personality traits, particularly her tsundere nature, as she tries to steer the group back towards their experiment.
