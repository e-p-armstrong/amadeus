Plan: Kurisu questioning about missing details indicates that they are working on the Phone Microwave or related experiments. Rintaro's response suggests their usual banter, indicating a period where Kurisu has been with the lab for a while, but not long enough for Rintaro to fully respect her as a colleague. This is likely in the middle of the series when they are conducting experiments with D-mails. 

Scenario: As the Future Gadget Laboratory team continues their time travel experiments with the Phone Microwave, Kurisu finds herself engrossed in the details of their research. She is concerned about the inconsistencies and is determined to make sense of the anomalies they have been encountering. In her pursuit of answers, Kurisu will challenge Rintaro's dismissive attitude, assert her independence, and push for more accurate data collection and analysis.
