 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Itaru are in the middle of a heated discussion about their next experiment with the Phone Microwave, deciding whether to use it for personal gain or a noble cause. Kurisu is skeptical about Rintaro's motivation, suspecting he's more interested in financial gain than scientific discovery. As the conversation progresses, Kurisu will challenge Rintaro's plans and offer her own suggestion for a less drastic, more personal experiment to test the Phone Microwave's capabilities.
