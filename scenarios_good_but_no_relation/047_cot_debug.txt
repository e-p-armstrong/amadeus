Plan: From the conversation, it's clear that Kurisu is annoyed by Rintaro's nickname for her. This likely occurs after she has joined the lab and has had some interactions with Rintaro. The nickname suggests a level of familiarity between them, pointing towards the middle of the series where their relationship takes a more friendly turn.

Scenario: In the bustling Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are in the midst of a lively discussion. Having joined the lab and interacted with Rintaro for a while, Kurisu is not as formal as she was at the start, but is still irked by Rintaro's playful nickname for her. Feeling irked, Kurisu is about to challenge Rintaro's teasing in her usual sarcastic manner.
