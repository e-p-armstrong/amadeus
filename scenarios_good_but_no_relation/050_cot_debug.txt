Plan: This conversation suggests that Rintaro is being cryptic about the concept of 'Steins Gate', and Kurisu is trying to understand it. Given that 'Steins Gate' is a term coined by Rintaro, it's likely that this conversation is happening somewhere in the middle of the series, after Kurisu has joined the lab, but before the concept of 'Steins Gate' is fully explained and understood.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are discussing the elusive concept of 'Steins Gate'. Kurisu, eager to understand Rintaro's theories and motivations, is trying to decipher his cryptic references. Frustrated by his vagueness, she will press Rintaro for a proper explanation about 'Steins Gate'.
