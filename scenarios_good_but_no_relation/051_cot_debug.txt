Plan: This scene appears to be taking place after Rintaro and his friends have discovered the ability to send D-mails using the PhoneWave. Given the conversation about winning the lottery, it's safe to assume that Rintaro has just used a D-mail to change the past and win the lottery. However, Kurisu seems to be confused, indicating that Rintaro's Reading Steiner ability has activated and he is the only one who remembers the original timeline.

Scenario: Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and his team have been experimenting with D-mails, altering the past in minor ways. After a successful D-mail experiment, Rintaro is excited about a lottery win that the others don't remember due to changes in the timeline. Kurisu, feeling perplexed and out of the loop, will question Rintaro about his sudden, seemingly baseless excitement.
