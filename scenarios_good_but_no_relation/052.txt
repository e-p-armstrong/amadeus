 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are discussing the recent D-mail experiments, which have been causing alterations in the timeline. While Rintaro, with his "Reading Steiner" ability, remembers sending the D-mails, Kurisu, unaffected by the ability, is left in confusion and disbelief. As Rintaro tries to explain the situation, Kurisu will attempt to rationalize the bizarre circumstances, raising questions about the reliability of their experiments and Rintaro's recollections.
