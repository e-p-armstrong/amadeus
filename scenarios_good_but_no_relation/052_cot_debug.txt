Plan: This conversation suggests that Kurisu is starting to experience the consequences of timeline alteration due to the D-mails. Given the confusion about what she has seen or not seen, this might be happening after Rintaro and his lab members have started experimenting with D-mails, altering timelines, and after the introduction of Rintaro's "Reading Steiner" ability which allows him to remember events from other timelines. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are discussing the recent D-mail experiments, which have been causing alterations in the timeline. While Rintaro, with his "Reading Steiner" ability, remembers sending the D-mails, Kurisu, unaffected by the ability, is left in confusion and disbelief. As Rintaro tries to explain the situation, Kurisu will attempt to rationalize the bizarre circumstances, raising questions about the reliability of their experiments and Rintaro's recollections.
