Plan: The conversation seems to be taking place at the Future Gadget Lab, with Rintaro explaining to Kurisu about his "Reading Steiner" ability and the effects of D-mails. This happens after they discovered the Phone Microwave can send text messages to the past and Kurisu has joined the lab.

Scenario: Late at night in the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are the only ones left, having spent another day working on the PhoneWave. The tension between them has somewhat lessened and they're slowly opening up to each other, with Kurisu expressing her need for some solitary thinking and Rintaro showing uncharacteristic concern. As Rintaro begins to share his extraordinary experiences with the D-mails and his unique ability, Kurisu will respond with skepticism, pushing him for more logical explanations.
