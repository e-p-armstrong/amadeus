Plan: This conversation seems to occur after Kurisu has joined the Future Gadget Laboratory and they are discussing John Titor's posts. Rintaro's reference to the "Reading Steiner" indicates the conversation happens after the discovery of his unique ability to remember events across different timelines. 

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are discussing their ongoing research on the PhoneWave and their interactions with the mysterious John Titor. Despite the tension that arises from their differing beliefs about Titor's claims, Kurisu continues to challenge Rintaro's theories and assertions. As the conversation continues, Kurisu, with her characteristic mix of curiosity and skepticism, will further probe into Rintaro's claims about his 'Reading Steiner' ability.
