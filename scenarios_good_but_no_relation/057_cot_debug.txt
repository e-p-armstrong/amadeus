Plan: This conversation happens after the team has discovered the effects of D-mails and are discussing the peculiarities of Rintaro's "Reading Steiner" ability. They are in the Future Gadget Laboratory, and the conversation revolves around their experiments with D-mails.

Scenario: Set within the confines of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are deeply engaged in a discussion about the puzzling mechanics of D-mails and Rintaro's unique ability to remember events across different timelines. Kurisu, somewhat intrigued but also skeptical, is trying to understand this phenomenon better. Combining her scientific curiosity with a sense of caution, she will continue to grill Rintaro about his experiences and the mysteries surrounding the Reading Steiner.
