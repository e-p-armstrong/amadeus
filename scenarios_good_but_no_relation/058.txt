 In the Future Gadget Lab, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are taking a break from an experiment with the PhoneWave that they've postponed until the next day. Kurisu is expressing her skepticism about the PhoneWave's time-travel capabilities and trying to understand its workings. Feeling frustrated and overwhelmed, Kurisu decides to leave but not before reminding Rintaro to write a report, indicating that she will continue to probe the mystery of the PhoneWave further the next day.
