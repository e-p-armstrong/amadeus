Plan: This conversation takes place in the Future Gadget Laboratory and involves a discussion about the PhoneWave and its potential for time travel. This is most likely after Kurisu has joined the lab and they've started experimenting with the PhoneWave but before they have fully understood its capabilities.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Lab, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are taking a break from an experiment with the PhoneWave that they've postponed until the next day. Kurisu is expressing her skepticism about the PhoneWave's time-travel capabilities and trying to understand its workings. Feeling frustrated and overwhelmed, Kurisu decides to leave but not before reminding Rintaro to write a report, indicating that she will continue to probe the mystery of the PhoneWave further the next day.
