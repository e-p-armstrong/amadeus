 Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are in the Future Gadget Laboratory, in the midst of another ordinary day, interacting casually in between their intense time travel research.

In this conversation, she will be responding to Rintaro's and Itaru's jokes and exaggerations with her own wit and sarcasm, reflecting her growing sense of camaraderie with the team.
