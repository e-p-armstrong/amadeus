Plan: The conversation is about an experiment with the PhoneWave, which implies that it takes place after the team discovered its time travel capabilities but before any serious shifts in the timeline. It involves attempts to send a D-Mail, with Mayuri's casual comments about her food choices serving as the D-Mail content. The playful, experimental tone suggests it is before any serious consequences of their actions have come to light.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, the group, including Kurisu, is in the middle of another round of testing the PhoneWave's ability to send D-mails. The atmosphere is light and casual, a stark contrast to the gravity of the experiments they are conducting. Kurisu, despite her initial reservations, participates in the conversation and is about to witness another round of the D-Mail experiment, with a tinge of disbelief still lingering in her.
