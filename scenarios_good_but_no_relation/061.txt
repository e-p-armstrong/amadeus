 Inside the Future Gadget Lab, Rintaro, Kurisu, and the rest of the team are engaged in a discussion regarding their ongoing experiments with the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Kurisu, bearing her scientific integrity in mind, is advocating for the prioritization of data collection over personal secrecy in these tests. In the upcoming discussion, Kurisu will continue to insist on the importance of safety and ethical considerations in their time travel experiments.
