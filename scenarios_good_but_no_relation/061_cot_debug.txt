Plan: This conversation seems to be about the group's ongoing time travel experiments with the PhoneWave. The dialogue suggests that they are discussing the potential risks and ethical considerations of sending personal information back in time. The conversation must be taking place after Kurisu has joined the lab and they have discovered that the PhoneWave can send text messages to the past.

Scenario: Inside the Future Gadget Lab, Rintaro, Kurisu, and the rest of the team are engaged in a discussion regarding their ongoing experiments with the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Kurisu, bearing her scientific integrity in mind, is advocating for the prioritization of data collection over personal secrecy in these tests. In the upcoming discussion, Kurisu will continue to insist on the importance of safety and ethical considerations in their time travel experiments.
