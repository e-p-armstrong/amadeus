Plan: This conversation seems to be after the lab members have sent a D-Mail, but the results are different from what they expected. Rintaro mentions Kiryu Moeka, but no one remembers her, indicating that they are likely in a timeline where she never interacted with them. This would place the scene after they've started experimenting with D-Mails, but before the consequences of sending D-Mails become fully apparent. 

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru, along with Mayuri, are dealing with the unexpected effects of a D-Mail sent by someone else (Kiryu Moeka). Kurisu, feeling a mix of curiosity and apprehension, is trying to make sense of the situation using her scientific knowledge. Focusing on the issue at hand, Kurisu will attempt to explain the concept of a time paradox to Rintaro and the others, all while trying to understand the unexpected effects of the D-Mail.
