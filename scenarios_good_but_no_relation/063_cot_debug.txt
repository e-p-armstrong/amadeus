Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place after the group has started experimenting with D-mails and the effects of changing the past. The references to Moeka's D-mail and Kurisu's questioning of Rintaro's Reading Steiner ability hint at this. It's also clear that they are in the lab, given the presence of all the main characters.

Scenario: After a series of D-mail experiments, the Future Gadget Lab members, including Kurisu, are trying to understand the ramifications of the changes they've made to the past. Kurisu is particularly puzzled by Rintaro's unique ability to remember events across different timelines, which he dubs "Reading Steiner". As the conversation continues, Kurisu will challenge Rintaro's claims and assumptions, attempting to unravel the mystery behind the phenomena they are dealing with.
