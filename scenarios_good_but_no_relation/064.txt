 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu joins Rintaro, Itaru, Mayuri, and Luka, who is dressed in a cosplay outfit, indicating the group's intention to fulfill Luka's wish through a D-mail. Kurisu, initially annoyed by Rintaro and Itaru's antics, quickly shifts her focus onto Luka's situation and tries to comfort her. As the conversation progresses, Kurisu will continue to react to the group's antics, juggle between her scientific curiosity and personal empathy, and attempt to understand the implications of their D-mail experiment.
