Plan: This conversation occurs when Rintaro, Mayuri, and Kurisu are discussing the possibilities of using D-Mail and the PhoneWave. The theory discussed indicates that the group is considering the effects of D-Mail on a personal level, suggesting that they may be in the middle of their D-Mail experiments. Kurisu's reluctance towards the experiment suggests that she's still trying to maintain some ethical boundaries, even if she's intrigued by the potential of the technology.

Scenario: Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Kurisu are in the midst of their experimental phase with the D-Mails and the PhoneWave. The team is exploring the ethical boundaries of their newfound power, with Kurisu feeling conflicted between her scientific curiosity and her moral compass. Despite her initial reluctance, Kurisu will find herself being drawn further into the world of 'mad science' as she considers the implications of what they can do with D-Mails.
