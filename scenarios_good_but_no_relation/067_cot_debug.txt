Plan: From this conversation, we can assume that Kurisu is trying to pass on her responsibilities to someone else in the lab, specifically Luka (Urushibara-san). This suggests a point in the story where Kurisu has become an integral part of the lab's activities and is shouldering a lot of the workload, likely after a series of D-mail experiments. The fact that Rintaro is denying her request indicates that her role is critical and cannot be easily replaced. 

Scenario: After an intense period of testing and experimentation with the PhoneWave, Kurisu finds herself overwhelmed with the lab's operations inside the Future Gadget Laboratory. Feeling the weight of the responsibility, she attempts to offload some of her tasks to Luka Urushibara. However, given her indispensable role, Kurisu's resignation is swiftly denied by Rintaro, propelling her towards another round of reluctant commitment to their time travel endeavors.
