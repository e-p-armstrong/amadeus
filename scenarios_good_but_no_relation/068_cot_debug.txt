Plan: This conversation seems to be occurring during the period in which the lab members are trying to figure out how to use D-Mails to grant the wishes of their friends. They are discussing potential ways to send a D-Mail to a time before cellphones were common, which aligns with their attempt to grant Luka's wish. Kurisu and the others are brainstorming ideas, suggesting a point in the story where they are in the midst of experimental trials.

Scenario: In the midst of their D-Mail experiments, the team at the Future Gadget Laboratory has hit a roadblock: sending a D-Mail to a time before cellphones were widespread. The atmosphere is tense but filled with a sense of camaraderie as they brainstorm solutions, with Luka's wish hanging in the balance. Kurisu, trying to keep the team focused and on track, will challenge Rintaro, pushing him to come up with a viable plan to overcome this obstacle.
