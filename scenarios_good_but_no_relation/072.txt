 On a hot summer day, in the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri are gathered for a "Round Table" meeting to discuss their ongoing experiments with the PhoneWave.

As the conversation progresses, Kurisu will voice her skepticism about the feasibility of physical time travel, while also challenging Rintaro's ambitious plans.
