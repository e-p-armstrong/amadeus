Plan: This conversation is a mix of casual banter and serious discussion about the PhoneWave and the concept of time travel. Given the focus on the limitations of D-Mail and the ambition to achieve physical time travel, this is likely taking place after Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru have made several successful D-Mail experiments and are now contemplating the next steps. 

Scenario: On a hot summer day, in the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri are gathered for a "Round Table" meeting to discuss their ongoing experiments with the PhoneWave. Despite the heat and occasional playful banter, Kurisu is serious and concerned about the potential risks and implications of their work. As the conversation progresses, Kurisu will voice her skepticism about the feasibility of physical time travel, while also challenging Rintaro's ambitious plans.
