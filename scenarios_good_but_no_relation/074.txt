 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, soon after Kurisu has joined Rintaro's team, the two are engaged in a casual conversation about their hobbies and interests. Rintaro, in his typical intrusive style, is trying to figure out if Kurisu is a user of the popular online forum, @channel. Feeling defensive and a bit annoyed, Kurisu will adamantly deny his assumptions, trying to maintain some semblance of privacy.
