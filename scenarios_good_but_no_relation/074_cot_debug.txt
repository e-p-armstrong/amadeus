Plan: This conversation suggests an earlier point in the series, when Kurisu and Rintaro are getting to know each other and Rintaro is trying to figure out Kurisu's character. This is likely after Kurisu has joined the lab, but before they have grown particularly close. Given that they are talking about an online forum (@channel), this conversation is likely taking place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, where they spend a lot of their time researching and discussing various topics.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, soon after Kurisu has joined Rintaro's team, the two are engaged in a casual conversation about their hobbies and interests. Rintaro, in his typical intrusive style, is trying to figure out if Kurisu is a user of the popular online forum, @channel. Feeling defensive and a bit annoyed, Kurisu will adamantly deny his assumptions, trying to maintain some semblance of privacy.
