 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu is in the midst of translating SERN's research while Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri are discussing their findings and plans, all of them attempting to understand and replicate SERN's time travel experiments. Kurisu is growing frustrated with Rintaro's eccentricities and the complicated situation they've found themselves in, yet is determined to continue her work. As the conversation progresses, Kurisu will take on the role of the voice of reason, expressing her disbelief and concern at Itaru's reckless idea to interfere with SERN's Large Hadron Collider.
