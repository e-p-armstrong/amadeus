Plan: This conversation revolves around the disappearance of the IBN 5100, a key piece of equipment. The mention of D-Mails and the references to experiments and events suggest this is somewhere in the middle of the story, after the group has been experimenting with D-Mails and before the major crisis with SERN. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri are in the midst of a tense discussion about the sudden disappearance of the IBN 5100, a crucial tool in their time-travel experiments. Kurisu is puzzled and a little skeptical about Rintaro's claims of timeline alterations and his unique ability to remember them. As the group leader, Kurisu will try to make sense of the situation and work towards finding the missing IBN 5100, displaying her logical and analytical approach to problem-solving.
