Plan: The conversation indicates that they are trying to get in touch with Faris. Based on the context, this could be when they are attempting to undo the D-mails and return to the original timeline. The casual conversation and Mayuri's cheerful tone suggest that this is before SERN's attack and Mayuri's death.

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, the team, consisting of Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri, are strategizing their next move regarding the D-mails. In the midst of their discussion, Faris' name comes up, and they decide to reach out to her. Expecting yet another unconventional exchange, Kurisu braces herself for the unique communication style Mayuri and Faris share.
