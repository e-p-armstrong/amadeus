Plan: This conversation is clearly taking place over the phone, with Kurisu at the Future Gadget Laboratory and Rintaro and Itaru elsewhere. The topic of conversation and the fact that Kurisu is adjusting the settings of the PhoneWave suggests this is during the period of time when they're actively experimenting with the device. The fact that Kurisu is being asked to do this suggests she's already a trusted member of the team.

Scenario: Kurisu is alone in the Future Gadget Laboratory, having been left behind by Rintaro and Itaru who are away for some reason. She is contacted by Rintaro, who despite his eccentric act, needs her help to adjust the settings of the PhoneWave for an upcoming experiment. Kurisu, despite her initial annoyance at Rintaro's antics, will comply with his request, showcasing her dedication to their shared goal of perfecting the time machine.
