 Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Mayuri are preparing to run another test on the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Kurisu, on the phone and likely near the microwave, is waiting for instructions from Rintaro. Showing signs of impatience and eagerness to proceed, Kurisu is about to start another round of experimentation on the PhoneWave after Rintaro gives the go-ahead.
