Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place over a phone call, with Kurisu waiting for Rintaro to give her instructions. Given that they're discussing the PhoneWave (name subject to change), this is likely taking place after Kurisu has joined the lab, but before they've perfected the time leap. 

Scenario: Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Mayuri are preparing to run another test on the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Kurisu, on the phone and likely near the microwave, is waiting for instructions from Rintaro. Showing signs of impatience and eagerness to proceed, Kurisu is about to start another round of experimentation on the PhoneWave after Rintaro gives the go-ahead.
