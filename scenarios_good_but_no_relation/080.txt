 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, the team is taking a break from their usual research and experimentation. After a long summer of working on the PhoneWave, Mayuri suggests a beach trip, sparking a lively discussion among the lab members. Despite her initial acceptance of the idea, Kurisu will eventually refuse the proposal, citing her departure back to America and her reluctance to swim with the male members of the team.
