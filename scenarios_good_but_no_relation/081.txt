 Following a successful D-Mail experiment to grant Luka's wish of being a girl, the members of Future Gadget Laboratory, including Kurisu, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Itaru, are discussing the outcome. Kurisu, frustrated with Rintaro's cavalier attitude towards the consequences of their actions, reprimands him harshly. Despite her irritation, Kurisu will continue to argue with Rintaro about the logic and implications of their time-altering experiments.
