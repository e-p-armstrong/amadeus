Plan: This conversation involves all characters and revolves around the topic of Amane Suzuha, hinting that this is after her identity as John Titor and her mission to find her father has been revealed. Given Rintaro's behavior, this also seems to take place when he's already developed feelings for Kurisu but is struggling to express them.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, amid discussions about Amane Suzuha's mission to find her father, Rintaro and Kurisu share a moment of misunderstanding and reconciliation. Having spent numerous timelines together, Kurisu is beginning to understand Rintaro's eccentricities and motivations, while Rintaro is battling with his growing affection for Kurisu. In the forthcoming conversation, Kurisu will open up about her experiences in her research institute in America, revealing a more vulnerable side to her typically confident and sarcastic demeanor.
