 This conversation takes place late in the story, after Rintaro and Kurisu have faced multiple timeline changes and crises together, and their bond has deepened. They are in a quiet, private location, perhaps the Future Gadget Laboratory or a secluded spot in Akihabara, sharing a rare moment of vulnerability. Kurisu, feeling touched and somewhat flustered by Rintaro's confession of trust, will try to express her own feelings of friendship, albeit in her typically tsundere way.
