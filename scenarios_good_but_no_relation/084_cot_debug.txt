Plan: From the dialogue, it's clear that this is a casual scene set in the Future Gadget Laboratory. The characters are discussing a missed event, and Mayuri is cooking. The fact that Kurisu suggests using the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to warm up eggs implies that this scene occurs after the PhoneWave's time travel capabilities have been discovered, but before the consequences of its use become dire.

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, the team is relaxing after a day of experiments, talking about a missed event that Itaru had been looking forward to. The atmosphere is light and casual, and Mayuri is cooking dinner for the group. Amid the banter and the smell of Mayuri's cooking, Kurisu is about to suggest a rather unconventional use for the PhoneWave, using it to heat up eggs, showcasing her humor and willingness to engage with the group's dynamics.
