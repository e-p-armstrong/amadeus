Plan: This conversation seems to occur just after Kurisu has made a significant discovery in understanding the PhoneWave. Given the detailed technical discussion, this conversation likely takes place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, after Kurisu has joined Rintaro's lab and begun assisting with their experiments. Kurisu's mention of the LHC and the black holes indicates this is during the time they are developing the theory behind their time machine.

Scenario: After spending some time analyzing the PhoneWave in the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu has had a revelation about its functionality and how it might be connected to the Large Hadron Collider's principles. The tension in the air is palpable as the group gathers around to hear her explain her hypothesis. Kurisu, feeling both excited and anxious, will delve into a detailed explanation of her theory, taking them one step closer to understanding their accidental invention.
