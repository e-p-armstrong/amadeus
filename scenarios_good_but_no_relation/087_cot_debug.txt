Plan: From the conversation, it's clear that the team is discussing the potential of the PhoneWave in achieving physical time travel and the issues surrounding this. Kurisu is pointing out the problems and practical difficulties. This likely takes place after they discovered that the PhoneWave can send D-mails but before they discover the Time Leap method.

Scenario: The Future Gadget Laboratory is abuzz with heated discussion as Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru grapple with the challenges of transforming the PhoneWave into a device capable of physical time travel. Kurisu, ever the pragmatic scientist, is concerned about the technical obstacles and the competition with SERN. As the conversation continues, Kurisu will voice her reservations, highlighting the issues with setting a destination and finding the mysterious 'lifter', while trying to curb Rintaro's unchecked enthusiasm.
