Plan: Based on the conversation, this is the scene where Kurisu is proposing the idea of a 'time leap' to Rintaro and Itaru. This is after they have been experimenting with D-mails, and Kurisu is applying her neuroscience knowledge to propose a new method of time travel. This is a major breakthrough that leads to the development of the Time Leap Machine, and it happens in the Future Gadget Laboratory.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are brainstorming about the potential of their time travel research after their initial discoveries with D-mails. Kurisu, drawing on her extensive background in neuroscience, presents a radical new concept: sending human memories back in time. She is about to lay out the basis for what will eventually become the Time Leap Machine.
