Plan: The conversation suggests it's happening in the lab, during one of their peaceful moments. This is likely after Kurisu has joined the lab and they've had time to experiment with the time machine and become comfortable with each other, before the SERN crisis. 

Scenario: In the laid-back environment of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are enjoying a moment of levity amidst their intense research on the PhoneWave. Kurisu, despite her usual composed demeanor, is flustered after being caught using @channel memes, a popular Internet forum in Japan. In the ensuing conversation, she will try to keep her cool and convince Rintaro to keep her online activities a secret.
