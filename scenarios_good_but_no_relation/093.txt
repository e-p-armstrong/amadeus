 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Mayuri proposes a sleepover, inviting Kurisu to stay. Kurisu, initially uncomfortable with the idea of spending the night in the same space as Rintaro, eventually agrees to stay for the sake of working on the PhoneWave. Despite her sarcastic comments and playful banter with Rintaro, Kurisu is preparing to settle in for the night, planning to continue their research while maintaining a safe and respectful environment.
