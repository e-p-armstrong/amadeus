 Kurisu, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Itaru are in the Future Gadget Lab, where they have just completed the Time Leap Machine, an upgrade to the PhoneWave which can send memories instead of just text messages back in time. Their camaraderie and playful banter indicate a lighthearted atmosphere, with them even holding a joking vote to name the new creation. Kurisu, feeling triumphant and vindicated, is preparing to explain the workings of the Time Leap Machine in detail, trying to justify her naming choice and prove the machine's potential to the others.
