Plan: This conversation is clearly about the Time Leap Machine and the risks and implications of using it. This means it's taking place after the discovery and development of the Time Leap Machine (which is after the D-Mail discovery and experiments), but before Mayuri's repeated deaths and the SERN attack. It's a critical conversation where they're deciding who will use the machine first, and what the potential consequences might be.

Scenario: Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri are at the Future Gadget Laboratory, discussing the potential consequences of using the newly-developed Time Leap Machine. Kurisu, skeptical and apprehensive about the unknown, suggests turning the machine over to professionals, but Rintaro is keen on experimenting. Despite her trepidation, Kurisu will engage in a lengthy, detailed discussion about the mechanics and theoretical implications of time leaping, trying to alleviate the team's fears.
