 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Mayuri are grappling with the implications of their latest invention, the Time Leap Machine, that can send memories back in time. Caught between the thrill of scientific discovery and the ethical dilemma of using such a powerful device, Kurisu is relieved when Rintaro decides not to experiment with time leaping. Kurisu will express her gratitude to Rintaro and starts to refocus her attention on the PhoneWave, while also dealing with the fact that their actions may prevent her from returning to America for some time.
