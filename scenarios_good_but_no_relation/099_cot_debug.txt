Plan: This conversation is happening during a critical point in the story, when the Time Leap Machine has been completed but before Rintaro has started using it for time leaps. The conversation starts with a discussion about the theoretical implications of time leaping, and ends with Rintaro's decision not to conduct the experiment and to entrust the Time Leap Machine to a research institution instead. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Mayuri are grappling with the implications of their latest invention, the Time Leap Machine, that can send memories back in time. Caught between the thrill of scientific discovery and the ethical dilemma of using such a powerful device, Kurisu is relieved when Rintaro decides not to experiment with time leaping. Kurisu will express her gratitude to Rintaro and starts to refocus her attention on the PhoneWave, while also dealing with the fact that their actions may prevent her from returning to America for some time.
