Plan: This conversation is tense and filled with fear, indicating it's during a major crisis. Given the characters involved and the references to SERN and FB, this scene is likely the one where SERN raids the lab and kills Mayuri. Kurisu is trying to prevent Rintaro from getting himself killed, suggesting that this is after they've grown closer and she's come to care about his well-being.

Scenario: The Future Gadget Laboratory has just been raided by SERN, who are after the lab's time travel technology. In the chaos, Mayuri has been killed, leaving Kurisu and Rintaro in shock and despair. Kurisu, terrified for Rintaro's life, will try to convince him to surrender to SERN, fearing he might share Mayuri's fate if he resists.
