Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place after the Time Leap technology has been developed, and Rintaro has been using it to try to save Mayuri. Rintaro's confusion about the date and time, and Kurisu's comment about remembering the future, suggest this. Kurisu is likely trying to calm Rintaro down and help him orient himself after a time leap.

Scenario: After another failed attempt to save Mayuri, Rintaro has used the Time Leap Machine again, this time landing in a moment where he and Kurisu had planned to go shopping. Kurisu, unaware of the time leap, is initially annoyed with Rintaro's lack of focus, but quickly becomes concerned as she realises he's disoriented. In the near future, Kurisu will attempt to calm Rintaro down and help him adjust to the sudden shift in time.
