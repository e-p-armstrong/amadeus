Plan: This conversation is taking place during a tense moment in the story where the lab members are being confronted by Moeka and SERN. This likely occurs during the part of the story where SERN has discovered the lab's time travel experiments and has sent Moeka to retrieve the lab members. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, the tranquility is shattered when Moeka, a SERN operative, corners Kurisu, Rintaro, and another lab member. The tense atmosphere is thick with fear and uncertainty as they find themselves trapped with no means of escape. Despite her confusion and rising fear, Kurisu, ever the scientist, will demand an explanation from Moeka, trying to understand their dire situation.
