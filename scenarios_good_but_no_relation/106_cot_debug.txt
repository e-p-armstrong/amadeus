Plan: This conversation is intense and suggests a dire situation. Given the characters involved and the mention of killing, it's likely during the part of the series where SERN raids the Future Gadget Laboratory. This is after the group has sent various D-mails, triggering changes in the timeline that have caught SERN's attention.

Scenario: After a series of D-mail experiments, the Future Gadget Laboratory has been raided by SERN agents, with Moeka revealing her true allegiance to the organization. Overwhelmed by the sudden turn of events and fearful for the life of her friend, Kurisu is desperately trying to convince Rintaro to comply with the enemy's demands to prevent his execution. As the tension mounts, Kurisu will make an emotional plea to Rintaro to surrender, in a desperate bid to keep him alive.
