Plan: This conversation is taking place during a high-stakes moment when Rintaro is attempting to use the time leap machine, probably to save Mayuri. The presence of Moeka suggests that this is during one of the SERN raids. Given Kurisu's surprise and confusion, it seems like it's one of Rintaro's early attempts to change the timeline, while he is still struggling to explain his situation.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are under attack from SERN, with Rintaro desperately trying to use the Time Leap Machine to save Mayuri. Kurisu, not yet aware of Rintaro's ability to retain his memories across timelines, is confused and concerned about his erratic behaviour and sudden urgency. In the ensuing chaos, Kurisu will try to understand Rintaro's actions while grappling with her own fear and confusion.
