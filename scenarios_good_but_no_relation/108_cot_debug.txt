Plan: This conversation is happening during a tense moment. Given Rintaro's urgency and the mention of not using the train, this conversation likely takes place after SERN has discovered the lab's time travel experiments and is planning to raid the lab. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru are suddenly faced with a crisis - the looming threat of SERN. Rintaro, with the knowledge of their imminent danger, instructs Kurisu and Itaru to leave the area immediately. Surprised and confused, Kurisu will demand an explanation from Rintaro, trying to understand the urgency of the situation.
