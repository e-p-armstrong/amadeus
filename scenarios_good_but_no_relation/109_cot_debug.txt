Plan: This exchange takes place after Mayuri's death at the hands of SERN and after Rintaro's first failed attempts to prevent her death by time leaping. The conversation is intense, indicative of Rintaro's desperation and Kurisu's concern for him. 

Scenario: In the wake of Mayuri's unexpected death and after several unsuccessful attempts to save her life using the Time Leap Machine, Rintaro is disheartened and confused, retreating to a public place to process his feelings. Kurisu, having noticed his distressed state, seeks him out, concerned about his well-being and the implications of his repeated time leaps. In this emotionally charged conversation, Kurisu will attempt to dissuade Rintaro from further risky time leaps, but ultimately agrees to help him save Mayuri due to their shared attachment to her.
