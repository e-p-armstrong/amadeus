 Rintaro is in a desperate race against time, repeatedly using the Time Leap Machine to prevent Mayuri's death, but without success. Kurisu, aware of his struggle and feeling a sense of responsibility, is trying to provide him with guidance while also grappling with her own feelings of concern for him. In the upcoming conversation, Kurisu will advise Rintaro on a new plan of action, suggesting that he leap to an even earlier time and explain the situation to her again, in an attempt to change the future.
