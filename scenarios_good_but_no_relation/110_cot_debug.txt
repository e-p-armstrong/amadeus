Plan: This conversation occurs during the period of the story where Mayuri is repeatedly dying and Rintaro is trying to save her by time leaping. Kurisu is empathetic and supportive of Rintaro's struggles, and is trying to help him figure out what he should do next.

Scenario: Rintaro is in a desperate race against time, repeatedly using the Time Leap Machine to prevent Mayuri's death, but without success. Kurisu, aware of his struggle and feeling a sense of responsibility, is trying to provide him with guidance while also grappling with her own feelings of concern for him. In the upcoming conversation, Kurisu will advise Rintaro on a new plan of action, suggesting that he leap to an even earlier time and explain the situation to her again, in an attempt to change the future.
