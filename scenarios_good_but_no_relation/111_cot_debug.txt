Plan: This conversation seems to occur after the development of the "Time Leap" method. The characters are discussing the implications of time leaping, suggesting that it happens after the invention of the method but before the SERN raid. Kurisu's final statement suggests they're trying to find a way to save Mayuri.

Scenario: After successfully developing the "Time Leap" method at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and the rest of the team are grappling with the moral and practical implications of their invention. Kurisu is feeling a mixture of scientific curiosity, concern for her friends, and a stubborn refusal to accept the limitations that their invention seems to impose. As the conversation continues, Kurisu will argue against the concept that time leaping can't change Mayuri's fate, and suggest potential scientific theories that could provide them with a solution.
