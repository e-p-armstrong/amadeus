Plan: This conversation takes place during the period of time where Mayuri is repeatedly dying, no matter what Rintaro does to try and save her. Kurisu and Rintaro are trying to figure out a way to prevent Mayuri's death, and Kurisu is explaining the limitations of the Time Leap Machine they have developed.

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are in a tense conversation after multiple failed attempts to save Mayuri's life using the Time Leap Machine. Kurisu, feeling responsible and under pressure, is trying to remain calm and rational, pushing Rintaro to do the same. She is about to explain the theoretical limits of their time travel technology to Rintaro, hoping it will offer a new perspective to their desperate situation.
