Plan: The conversation revolves around the limitations of the Time Leap Machine, indicating that this scene takes place after the machine's creation and the start of Mayuri's repeated deaths. Kurisu's mention of a specific date and time suggests they have already begun using the machine, most likely trying to prevent Mayuri's death. Given Rintaro's desperate tone, it is clear that they have not yet found a solution to their problem.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are locked in a tense discussion over the limitations of the Time Leap Machine, the life-saving device they have been working on following the tragic repeated deaths of Mayuri. The atmosphere is heavy with desperation, as they grapple with the harsh reality of their inability to leap back far enough in time to prevent Mayuri's fate. Kurisu, feeling frustrated and cornered, will attempt to explain the harsh reality of their situation to Rintaro, struggling to balance her scientific pragmatism with the urgent desperation of their situation.
