Plan: The conversation suggests a situation of secrecy and urgency. The mention of Mayuri and the need to keep her in the dark indicates a scenario where the characters are dealing with a difficult or dangerous situation, which they do not want Mayuri to know about. Given Rintaro's involvement and the secretive nature of the conversation, it's likely this takes place during the time-leap experiments or the efforts to undo the D-mails. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are engrossed in a secret discussion, related to their latest time-leap experiment or the process of undoing the D-mails. They are particularly concerned about keeping Mayuri oblivious to the potentially distressing details of their work.
