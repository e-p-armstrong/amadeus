 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and the team have just been thrust into a tense situation with the revelation of Suzuha's true identity as a time-traveling resistance member fighting against a dystopian future ruled by SERN. Kurisu, intrigued yet skeptical, questions the plausibility of SERN's political control, given her knowledge of the institution. As the conversation continues, Kurisu will find herself revealing her own online alter ego, 'KuriGohan and Kamehameha', used for her interactions with John Titor.
