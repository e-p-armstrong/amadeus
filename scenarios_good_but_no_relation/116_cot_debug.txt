Plan: This conversation is heavy and takes place after Suzuha reveals herself as a time-traveller and talks about the dystopian future. Given Kurisu's strong reaction, this is likely the moment where she learns that she will help SERN in the future and subsequently die. 

Scenario: Within the confines of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Suzuha are grappling with the harsh realities revealed by Suzuha about the dystopian future ruled by SERN. Kurisu is in disbelief and shock upon learning of her future collaboration with SERN and her early death, considering her strong disdain for their unethical practices. As she digests this news, Kurisu will anxiously question Suzuha further, trying to understand the circumstances that led to her future actions and death.
