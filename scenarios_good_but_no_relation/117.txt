 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro and Suzuha have gathered for a pivotal discussion after Suzuha's revelation of her true identity as a time-traveller. They are delving into the complex concept of Attractor Fields, a theory that Suzuha brought with her from the future. In the midst of this enlightening conversation, Kurisu, intrigued and somewhat skeptical, will probe deeper into the implications of this model, questioning if it implies a deterministic universe.
