Plan: This conversation is a significant one, taking place at a point when Suzuha is explaining the concept of Attractor Fields to the other characters. This seems to happen after Suzuha has revealed her identity as a time-traveller. Kurisu's question at the end suggests that she is attempting to understand the concept and link it to her own knowledge. 

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro and Suzuha have gathered for a pivotal discussion after Suzuha's revelation of her true identity as a time-traveller. They are delving into the complex concept of Attractor Fields, a theory that Suzuha brought with her from the future. In the midst of this enlightening conversation, Kurisu, intrigued and somewhat skeptical, will probe deeper into the implications of this model, questioning if it implies a deterministic universe.
