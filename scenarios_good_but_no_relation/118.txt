 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, the team, consisting of Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Suzuha, is deep in a discussion about the nature of attractor fields, a concept they've discovered in their time travel research. They are theorizing about the possibility of jumping from one attractor field to another, an idea that could potentially allow them to alter their current timeline and avoid the danger that SERN poses. Kurisu, intrigued but skeptical, will challenge Suzuha's theory and push for a deeper understanding of the concept of attractor fields.
