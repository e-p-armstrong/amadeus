Plan: From the conversation, it's clear that the team is discussing the nature of attractor fields and the possibility of moving from one to another. This implies that they've already discovered the concept of attractor fields and are currently theorizing about their nature and capabilities. This part of the plot likely falls into the timeline where Rintaro, Kurisu, and the others are attempting to understand and manipulate time travel to avoid the impending danger from SERN.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, the team, consisting of Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Suzuha, is deep in a discussion about the nature of attractor fields, a concept they've discovered in their time travel research. They are theorizing about the possibility of jumping from one attractor field to another, an idea that could potentially allow them to alter their current timeline and avoid the danger that SERN poses. Kurisu, intrigued but skeptical, will challenge Suzuha's theory and push for a deeper understanding of the concept of attractor fields.
