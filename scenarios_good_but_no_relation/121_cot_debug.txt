Plan: Given the characters involved and Rintaro's announcement to leap to a specific time, this seems to be during the period when Rintaro is trying to save Mayuri by undoing the D-mails sent. This is likely after they've learned about Suzuha's true identity and before they start undoing the D-mails. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Suzuha are discussing their next steps in dealing with the time travel conundrum. Rintaro, in his "mad scientist" persona, is announcing his plans to leap to a specific time, indicating that they are deep in their attempts to undo the changes they've made to the timeline. Kurisu, feeling skeptical yet supportive, will question Rintaro's plan, seeking to ensure they are making the best decisions given the high stakes.
