Plan: This conversation happens after Rintaro has been time-leaping numerous times in an attempt to save Mayuri. It seems like he has just woken up from a leap, and this is evident from the first line by Kurisu and the fact that he's asking about Daru's whereabouts. The conversation then shifts to Mayuri and saving her, which means this happens at the point in the story where Rintaro is trying to save Mayuri by undoing the D-Mails. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, after yet another time leap, a weary Rintaro awakens to find Kurisu by his side, the remnants of his failed attempts at saving Mayuri lingering in the air. Kurisu, showing her caring side underneath her usual blunt demeanor, has been watching over Rintaro, concerned for his well-being amidst his unending struggle. Sensing Rintaro's despair, she will attempt to offer him comfort and support, even as they continue their desperate attempts to alter fate.
