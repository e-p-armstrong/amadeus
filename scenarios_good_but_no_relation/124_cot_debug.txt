Plan: Kurisu's line about the lifter and the CRT suggests that this is during the time when they are working on the Time Leap Machine, and Rintaro has started using his Reading Steiner ability to time leap. The conversation also reveals that Kurisu has become more comfortable with the idea of time travel, though she remains skeptical.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and the rest of the lab members are in the middle of their breakthrough project: the Time Leap Machine. After various time leaps, Rintaro has gained knowledge about the lifter and its connection with the 42-inch CRT downstairs, leaving Kurisu taken aback. Despite her skepticism, Kurisu is set to confront Rintaro about his sudden knowledge, further investigate the mysteries of the Time Leap Machine, and possibly challenge Rintaro's claims.
