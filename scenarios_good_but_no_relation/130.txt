 After a failed or disastrously consequential experiment with the Phone Microwave in the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu finds herself in the role of mediator between an irate Rintaro and a likely dejected Itaru. As the tension rises, Kurisu, despite her own concern and fear, puts on a facade of calm and rationality to help diffuse the situation. Kurisu will attempt to calm Rintaro down, and prevent any potential conflict between him and Itaru, while trying to keep her own emotions under control.
