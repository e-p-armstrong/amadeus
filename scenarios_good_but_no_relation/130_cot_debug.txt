Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place during a point of high tension, potentially after an experiment with the Phone Microwave has failed or created unexpected results. Given the characters involved and their emotional states, this is likely during the middle-end of the series, where the stakes are higher and the consequences of their experiments become more severe.

Scenario: After a failed or disastrously consequential experiment with the Phone Microwave in the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu finds herself in the role of mediator between an irate Rintaro and a likely dejected Itaru. As the tension rises, Kurisu, despite her own concern and fear, puts on a facade of calm and rationality to help diffuse the situation. Kurisu will attempt to calm Rintaro down, and prevent any potential conflict between him and Itaru, while trying to keep her own emotions under control.
