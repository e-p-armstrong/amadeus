Plan: This conversation hints at a pivotal moment in the plot where Rintaro realizes something important about the timeline and seeks confirmation from Kurisu. It seems like Rintaro is trying to figure out something about the timeline, and possibly how to prevent Mayuri's death. This conversation likely takes place after they have sent several D-mails and have noticed the repercussions, and after Suzuha's wish has been granted. 

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Mayuri are grappling with the consequences of their manipulation of time through D-mails. Rintaro, driven by his desperation to save Mayuri, is attempting to piece together the events that have transpired and how they have altered the timeline. Kurisu, although perplexed by Rintaro's sudden question, will provide the information he seeks, unknowingly setting the stage for their desperate attempts to undo the D-mails.
