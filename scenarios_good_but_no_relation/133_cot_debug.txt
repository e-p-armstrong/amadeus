Plan: Based on the conversation, it's apparent that the group is currently at ComiMa (Comic Market), but it's not crowded as it usually is. This is likely after they have sent a D-Mail, as indicated by Kurisu's question and Itaru's exclamation. Given the mention of biking back, they're probably preparing to return to the lab. 

Scenario: Following a successful D-Mail experiment, Kurisu, Itaru, and Mayuri find themselves at a vacant ComiMa, a stark contrast to its usual bustling environment. Having been swept up in the excitement of their recent discoveries with the D-mails, they took the opportunity to explore the now empty venue, which doubles as a rare moment of relaxation amidst their intense research. As they prepare to bike back to the lab, Kurisu, feeling a mix of exhaustion and apprehension, will voice her reluctance over the strenuous journey home.
