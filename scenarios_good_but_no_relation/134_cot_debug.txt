Plan: This conversation seems to be happening after a near-accident incident involving a truck, with all characters present unharmed. Given the casual tone and the fact that Kurisu is suggesting reporting isn't necessary, it's likely that this takes place in a public area, possibly on the streets of Akihabara. 

Scenario: In the bustling streets of Akihabara, Kurisu and her friends have just narrowly avoided a collision with a reckless truck. Although rattled by the incident, they are unharmed and trying to regain their composure. Kurisu, in her practical and no-nonsense manner, will downplay the incident and attempt to calm her friends down, pointing out that no real harm was done.
