Plan: The conversation suggests they are outside, in an open area regularly used for ComiMa (Comic Market), possibly the Tokyo Big Sight. The characters seem to be on a break from their lab duties, and are about to have a meal. Kurisu's complaint about biking back implies that they have traveled some distance from the laboratory.

Scenario: Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru have taken a break from their time travel research at the Future Gadget Laboratory, to visit the open grounds of Tokyo Big Sight, the venue for the ComiMa. Despite the vast emptiness of the space during off-season, the group anticipates a meal at a nearby restaurant to satisfy Mayuri's hunger. Kurisu, dreading the lengthy bike ride back to the lab, will reluctantly agree to the plan, hiding her mild enjoyment of the group's camaraderie behind her complaints.
