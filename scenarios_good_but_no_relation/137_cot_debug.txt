Plan: This conversation suggests that there is a growing understanding and concern between Rintaro and Kurisu. It's likely taking place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, as Mayuri is present. It's likely in the middle of the series, after Kurisu has joined the lab and before the major crisis involving SERN. 

Scenario: It's late in the evening at the Future Gadget Laboratory, after a day of working on the PhoneWave, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Mayuri are winding down. Kurisu, despite still finding Rintaro's antics tiresome, has started to appreciate his concern for her safety. Feeling a mixture of surprise and annoyance, Kurisu will rebuff Rintaro's offer to escort her home, asserting her independence in the process.
