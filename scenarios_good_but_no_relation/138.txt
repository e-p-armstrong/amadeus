 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and the others are engaged in a lighthearted yet insightful exchange about relationships and the structure of the universe, a rare moment of peace sandwiched between their intense time travel experiments. Having completed the Time Leap Machine but not yet faced the dire consequences of their actions, the group is at a crossroads. Caught off guard by Rintaro's sudden interest in the Time Leap Machine, Kurisu will question him, suspicious of his intentions and fearful of the potential misuse of their invention.
