Plan: This conversation seems to happen during a time of crisis, with Rintaro and Kurisu being pursued by unknown attackers. Given the mention of a taxi and pursuers, it's likely taking place in the city, outside of the lab. This scene could be happening during the time when SERN becomes aware of their time travel experiments and starts hunting them down.

Scenario: In the bustling city streets, Rintaro and Kurisu find themselves in the middle of a dangerous chase, pursued by unknown attackers possibly linked to SERN. The atmosphere is tense, with Rintaro hiding while Kurisu attempts to arrange an escape. Kurisu, feeling fearful yet determined, will use her wit and quick thinking to guide Rintaro to safety, while also trying to keep herself out of the clutches of their pursuers.
