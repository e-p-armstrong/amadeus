 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are discussing the aftermath of undoing Luka's D-mail, which has reversed his gender back to male but has also apparently caused him to fall in love with Rintaro. Kurisu is feeling analytical and slightly bemused by the unexpected romantic development. As the conversation progresses, she will try to help Rintaro make sense of the situation and guide him towards the next course of action in their quest to undo the effects of the D-mails and restore the original timeline.
