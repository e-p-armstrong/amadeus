Plan: This conversation is taking place during the period when Mayuri's death is imminent and Rintaro is trying to prevent it by undoing the D-mails. Kurisu's advice to Rintaro to use Luka (Urushibara-san) to get the necessary information indicates that they are trying to undo Luka's D-mail at this point. The setting is likely the Future Gadget Laboratory.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are grappling with the critical task of undoing the D-mails to prevent the impending death of Mayuri, who is doomed to die in two days. The tension is high as Kurisu, torn between her rational mind and her empathetic heart, is suggesting a plan that involves hurting Luka to force her to reveal information about her D-mail. In the coming conversation, Kurisu will wrestle with her guilt over this plan, while trying to convince Rintaro to consider it as a last resort.
