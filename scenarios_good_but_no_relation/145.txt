 In the middle of trying to undo the effects of a D-mail that changed Urashibara Luka's gender, Rintaro has brought Kurisu to Yanabayashi Shrine. She's initially irritated by Rintaro's sudden request and his staring, but agrees to assist. In the ensuing conversation, Kurisu will attempt to explain the scientific differences between male and female brains to Luka, with the ultimate goal of convincing Luka to help them revert the D-mail.
