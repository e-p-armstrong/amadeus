Plan: This conversation occurs during Rintaro's attempts to undo the D-mails he had sent earlier. In the process, he needs to change Urashibara Luka back to a male, and he needs Kurisu's help to explain the scientific differences between the male and female brain to Luka. This happens after Kurisu joins Rintaro's lab and they've developed a certain level of trust and familiarity.

Scenario: In the middle of trying to undo the effects of a D-mail that changed Urashibara Luka's gender, Rintaro has brought Kurisu to Yanabayashi Shrine. She's initially irritated by Rintaro's sudden request and his staring, but agrees to assist. In the ensuing conversation, Kurisu will attempt to explain the scientific differences between male and female brains to Luka, with the ultimate goal of convincing Luka to help them revert the D-mail.
