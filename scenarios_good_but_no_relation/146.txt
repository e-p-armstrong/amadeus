 In the laid-back atmosphere of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Mayuri, and the others are spending another ordinary day together, investigating the mysteries of the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Having become accustomed to the group's eccentricities, Kurisu is less standoffish, though her initial sharpness hasn't completely disappeared. In the midst of this casual setting, Kurisu will find herself engaging with Mayuri's cheerful demeanor, sharing a friendly interaction despite her slightly exasperated tone.
