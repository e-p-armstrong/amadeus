Plan: This conversation reveals that Rintaro is struggling with the knowledge of Luka's wish to change their gender, and Kurisu is advising him to grant the wish. This occurs after they've discovered the power of the D-mails and have started granting their friends' wishes. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are discussing Luka's request to alter the past and change their gender. Rintaro, torn and uncertain, has just shared the information with Kurisu, who despite her initial obliviousness, quickly grasps the situation. Kurisu, accepting and open-minded, will recommend to Rintaro to respect Luka's wish and send the D-mail, despite Rintaro's hesitations.
