Plan: This conversation is likely taking place in the middle of the story, after Kurisu has joined the lab but before the major crisis with SERN. Kurisu is helping Rintaro plan a date, which is something that would only happen after they've gotten to know each other better. It's also clear that they're not at a point of romantic tension yet, given the joking and casual way they're discussing the topic. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are taking a break from their usual work on the Phone Microwave to discuss something a little more personal. Rintaro is planning a date and has asked for advice, leading to a lighthearted conversation about dating etiquette and expectations. While Kurisu initially teases Rintaro about his romantic ideas, she will ultimately provide him with practical and useful advice on dating.
