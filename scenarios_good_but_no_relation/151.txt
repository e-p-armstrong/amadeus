 In the bustling Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are preparing for another round of experiments with the PhoneWave.

Caught between her concern for Mayuri and her growing interest in the PhoneWave, Kurisu will reluctantly assist Rintaro in his experiment, while sternly questioning his neglect of Mayuri.
