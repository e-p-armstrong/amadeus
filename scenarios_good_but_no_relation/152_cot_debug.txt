Plan: This conversation takes place in the late part of the story, after Rintaro has made multiple attempts to save Mayuri using the Time Leap Machine and has failed. He has also tried to undo the D-mails, particularly the one sent to Luka to change his gender in order to get the IBN 5100 back, but hesitates when faced with the painful choice of reverting Luka back to being a boy. 

Scenario: In the somber atmosphere of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro is grappling with the weight of his failed attempts to save Mayuri. He's been refusing to eat, stuck in a loop of guilt and despair. Kurisu, torn between her scientific rationale and her growing concern for Rintaro, will confront him about his stubbornness, try to offer him comfort, and urge him to face the consequences of his actions.
