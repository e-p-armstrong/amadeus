Plan: This conversation seems to happen at a moment of peace in the Future Gadget Laboratory, when the group is talking about Mayuri's upcoming cosplay event. Given the content of the conversation, it seems that the group is aware of the D-mails and the Phone Microwave but has not yet attracted SERN's attention. This is likely after Kurisu has joined the lab and built a rapport with the others, but before the time-leaping and Mayuri's repeated deaths.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Mayuri is eagerly discussing her upcoming cosplay event while Kurisu, Rintaro, and the others listen. Kurisu, feeling a bit out of place but trying to partake in the conversation, teases Rintaro about his protective nature towards Mayuri. Despite her initial refusal, she will eventually engage in a deeper conversation with Rintaro, hinting at her increasing interest and involvement in the group's activities.
