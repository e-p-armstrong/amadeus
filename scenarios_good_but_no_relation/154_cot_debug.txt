Plan: This is a very intense conversation between Rintaro and Kurisu, taking place during the time when Rintaro is stuck in a loop of time-leaping in order to prevent Mayuri's death. Rintaro has already made numerous time leaps and is explaining this to Kurisu, who doesn't remember due to the nature of time leaping. Rintaro is asking for her help to witness Mayuri's death so he can time leap again.

Scenario: After multiple failed attempts to save Mayuri's life through time leaping, Rintaro confides in Kurisu about his predicament outside the Future Gadget Laboratory. Kurisu, initially skeptical and confused due to the nature of time leaping erasing her memory of their repeated discussions, gradually grasps the gravity of the situation. Despite her initial shock and concern for Rintaro's wellbeing, Kurisu will agree to help him, though her frustration and worry are palpable.
