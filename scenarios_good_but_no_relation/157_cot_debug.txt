Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place during the time Rintaro is attempting to undo the D-mails to save Mayuri. Given that they're discussing about Moeka's D-mail and mentioning the IBN 5100, this is most likely when Rintaro is trying to undo Moeka's D-mail. 

Scenario: Rintaro and Kurisu are in their lab, working late into the night trying to undo the series of D-mails that have altered their timeline. Kurisu is feeling tired but persistently supports Rintaro, even though his desperate attempts worry her. As they discuss their next move, Kurisu will attempt to reason with him and advise caution in their next steps.
