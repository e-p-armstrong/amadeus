Plan: This conversation is happening at a critical point in the storyline. Based on the conversation, this seems to be taking place during the period when Rintaro is trying to undo the D-mails to revert to the original timeline, but before he has realized that undoing the original D-mail would mean Kurisu's death. Kurisu is trying to support Rintaro in his mission while also worrying about Mayuri's well-being.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu confronts Rintaro about his secretive behavior, concerned about the effect his actions are having on Mayuri. Rintaro, in his desperate attempts to reverse the D-mails, has been keeping Kurisu in the dark, causing her to worry about both him and Mayuri. Despite her concerns and the dangerous implications, Kurisu will insist on accompanying Rintaro, determined to stand by his side to face whatever challenges they may encounter.
