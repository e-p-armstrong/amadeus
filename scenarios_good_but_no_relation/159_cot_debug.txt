Plan: This conversation is taking place after Rintaro, Kurisu, and Moeka have located the elusive 'FB' and are preparing to send a D-Mail to undo Moeka's initial message. The mention of a gunshot and Nae suggests that they've just had the encounter with Tennouji (FB's real identity). Kurisu's concern about the D-Mail and the safety of the group suggests that they're in a high-stakes situation.

Scenario: After a tense confrontation with FB (Tennouji), Kurisu and Rintaro are in a secluded area, discussing the next steps for their mission to save Mayuri from SERN's clutches. Kurisu is anxious, fearing the potential consequences of their time-altering experiments and feeling responsible for the safety of her friends. With the pressing need to send the D-Mail quickly, Kurisu will prioritize getting back to the lab and ensuring they execute their plan without further harm or complication.
