Plan: This conversation indicates that something urgent has happened, likely an accident or an attack. Given that Moeka is mentioned, this is probably happening after the group has started sending D-mails, but before the SERN raid. Kurisu's suggestion to send a D-Mail suggests that they're trying to undo the event that just happened.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, following a sudden and shocking incident that involves Moeka, Rintaro is panicking. Kurisu, despite her own shock, is trying to keep her composure and manage the situation. In the midst of the chaos, Kurisu will suggest using their D-Mail technology to attempt to reverse the unforeseen event.
