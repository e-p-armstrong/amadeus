 Kurisu, Rintaro, and the rest of the lab team have been experimenting with D-Mails, altering past events to change the present, and they are now contemplating a D-Mail to alter Moeka's fate. With the theory of the attractor field and the concept of divergence in play, they are in the midst of the time leap experiments. Feeling uncertain but hopeful, Kurisu will suggest the sending of the D-Mail, anticipating the challenges and changes it may bring about.
