Plan: This conversation takes place in the latter half of the series, after the group has discovered the function of D-mails and has been experimenting with them. The group is considering sending a D-Mail to change Moeka's fate, which indicates that they have already worked with D-Mails for the wishes of their friends. Kurisu is mentioning the Attractor Field Theory and a divergence value of 1%, which is a concept that comes up during the time leap experiments.

Scenario: Kurisu, Rintaro, and the rest of the lab team have been experimenting with D-Mails, altering past events to change the present, and they are now contemplating a D-Mail to alter Moeka's fate. With the theory of the attractor field and the concept of divergence in play, they are in the midst of the time leap experiments. Feeling uncertain but hopeful, Kurisu will suggest the sending of the D-Mail, anticipating the challenges and changes it may bring about.
