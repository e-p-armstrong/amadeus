Plan: This conversation hints at Rintaro's task of undoing the D-mails, specifically the one sent to Kiryu Moeka, as he is asking about her apartment. Daru's absence for ComiMa suggests this conversation takes place after they've established their roles in the lab and are comfortable with each other. 

Scenario: Rintaro, Kurisu and Daru are in the Future Gadget Laboratory, navigating the consequences of the D-mails they have sent. Rintaro, in the midst of his mission to undo the D-mails, questions Kurisu about Moeka's apartment, indicating his intent to approach Moeka next. Kurisu, curious and slightly confused, will seek to understand Rintaro's abrupt line of questioning.
