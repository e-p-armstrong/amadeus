Plan: Given Rintaro's question about the IBN 5100, this conversation likely takes place after they've obtained the ancient computer but before they've completely figured out how to use it. This is a potentially stressful time as the lab members are trying to decipher SERN's secrets while also dealing with personal issues (like ComiMa for Itaru). It's also a period when Rintaro and Itaru's playful banter tends to get on Kurisu's nerves a bit. 

Scenario: In the midst of a particularly busy period at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Itaru is juggling decoding the IBN 5100 and preparing for ComiMa, while Rintaro enthusiastically gives him a playful title for his efforts. Kurisu, feeling exasperated and a little overwhelmed by their banter amidst the tension of their ongoing research, will ask them to quiet down to maintain her focus and sanity.
