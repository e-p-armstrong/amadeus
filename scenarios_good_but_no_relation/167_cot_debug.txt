Plan: This conversation transpires after Rintaro has revealed the existence of D-mails and how they have been altering timelines. The mention of the Time Leap Machine, cracking SERN’s database, and the first D-Mail suggests that this is during the phase where the discovery of D-mails and their consequences are being discussed. Kurisu shows a desire to see objective data, implying that she's still somewhat skeptical.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro has just revealed to Kurisu and Itaru the truth about D-mails and their ability to alter timelines. Kurisu, though initially skeptical, is beginning to accept the concept in theory, and is preparing to help Itaru crack SERN’s database to gather more evidence. She is setting aside her doubts and will proceed with the investigation, seeking concrete proof to validate Rintaro's claims.
