 In a quiet corner of Akihabara, Kurisu finds Rintaro, who has been acting strangely and withdrawn from the group due to the weight of the decisions he has to make. Kurisu, being concerned about Rintaro's behavior and well-being, and curious about the sudden halt in their experiments, seeks him out to try and understand what's going on. With a mixture of worry and determination, Kurisu will press Rintaro to divulge what's been troubling him, while challenging his understanding of their time travel theories.
