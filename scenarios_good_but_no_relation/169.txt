 After a series of timeline alterations and the discovery of the dire consequences of undoing the D-mails, Rintaro and Kurisu are now in the Future Gadget Laboratory, debating the nature of parallel worlds and their implications on existence. Kurisu, trying to comfort Rintaro, introduces a new perspective on the universality of worldlines, suggesting that her death on one timeline might not mean her death on all. In the coming conversation, Kurisu will try to convince Rintaro to accept her hypothesis, attempting to alleviate his fear of losing her.
