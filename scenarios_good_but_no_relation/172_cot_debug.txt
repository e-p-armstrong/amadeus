Plan: Given the characters involved and the topics discussed (time leaping, saving Mayuri, fear of being left behind, etc.), this conversation likely takes place during the latter part of the series, when Rintaro is repeatedly time leaping to save Mayuri and Kurisu is supporting him emotionally. It appears to be a private conversation between them, likely somewhere isolated or private. 

Scenario: In a quiet, secluded corner of Akihabara, Rintaro and Kurisu find themselves in a deep conversation about the repeated time leaps made to save Mayuri. Kurisu, having witnessed Rintaro's relentless efforts and suffering, feels a mix of worry, fear, and admiration for him. The conversation will take a turn towards Kurisu expressing her own fears about being left behind in the timeline shifts, showing her vulnerability to Rintaro for the first time.
