Plan: This conversation takes place near the end of the visual novel, when Rintaro is struggling with the decision to send the D-mail that would revert the timeline to one where Kurisu dies, but Mayuri lives. This is likely taking place somewhere private, where Rintaro and Kurisu can have a heart-wrenching conversation in peace. 

Scenario: In a quiet corner of Akihabara, Rintaro and Kurisu have a heartfelt conversation about the difficult decision that lies ahead. Kurisu, despite her own feelings, is resolutely urging Rintaro to choose a timeline where Mayuri survives, sacrificing herself in the process. Tearful but determined, Kurisu is set on heading back to the lab, aiming to put on a brave face and maintain a sense of normalcy amidst the looming crisis.
