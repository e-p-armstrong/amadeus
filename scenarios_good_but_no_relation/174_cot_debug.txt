Plan: This conversation likely takes place towards the end of the series, after Kurisu and Rintaro have finished undoing the D-mails and just before Rintaro receives the video message from his future self. It's probably in front of the lab, as Kurisu is preparing to head back to America.

Scenario: Standing in front of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu is preparing to say her goodbyes and return to America after an unexpected extension of her stay in Japan due to her involvement with Rintaro and his experiments. Having shared a lot of intense experiences with Rintaro and the rest of the lab members, she feels a mix of relief, regret, and sadness. In the following conversation, Kurisu will try to keep her composure, while unknowingly prompting a deeply emotional response from Mayuri.
