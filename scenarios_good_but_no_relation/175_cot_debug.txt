Plan: This conversation happens towards the end of the story. Kurisu is preparing to "disappear" from this worldline, and she's trying to console Mayuri and Rintaro about her departure, making it sound as if she's just returning to America. Given the emotional nature of this scene, it likely occurs after Rintaro has decided to revert the timeline back to the original one where Kurisu dies, to save Mayuri.

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu is getting ready to say her final goodbye to Rintaro and Mayuri, her newfound friends, before Rintaro undoes the D-mail that resulted in her survival. The atmosphere is thick with emotion, as Kurisu tries to lighten the mood by pretending she's merely going back to America. Kurisu, feeling a mix of sadness and determination, will make her farewell as light-hearted as possible, masking her true feelings to lessen the pain of her departure.
