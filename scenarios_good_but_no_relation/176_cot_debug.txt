Plan: This conversation seems to take place near the end of the series, when Rintaro is grappling with the decision to undo the D-mails and revert to the Beta worldline. They are likely at the Future Gadget Lab, and Kurisu is trying to convince Okabe to let go of his guilt and accept the reality of the situation.

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are in a heated discussion about the consequences of their time travel experiments. Kurisu is feeling a mixture of frustration, sadness, and resignation as she tries to persuade Rintaro to accept the unavoidable: the choice between her life and Mayuri's. Despite her strong exterior, Kurisu is also quietly desperate to know if she will be remembered in the Beta worldline, and will soon try to hide her vulnerability behind scientific jargon.
