Plan: This conversation is a heartfelt one between Rintaro and Kurisu. Given the deep emotional context and Kurisu leaving, it suggests the point of the plot where Rintaro and Kurisu confess their feelings for each other, but Rintaro has decided to revert to the timeline where Kurisu dies in order to save Mayuri. 

Scenario: It's a moment of intense emotion at Future Gadget Laboratory, as Rintaro and Kurisu confront their feelings for each other. The laboratory, usually a place of bizarre inventions and laughter, now serves as the backdrop for their heartfelt confession and farewell. In the midst of this painful goodbye, Kurisu is trying to ensure Rintaro won't forget her, and is about to leave, feeling torn between her emotions and the harsh reality of their situation.
