Plan: This conversation features Kurisu and Rintaro, and based on Rintaro's sudden, serious declaration that he's going to save Kurisu, it's likely taking place during a critical moment in the series. This could be when Rintaro has realized the original D-mail he sent about Kurisu's "death" is the cause of the altered timelines and that undoing it means Kurisu's death. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro has just returned from another failed attempt to save Mayuri, deeply affected by the recurring tragedies. Kurisu, oblivious to the gravity of the situation, greets him casually upon his return, only to be taken aback by his abrupt and heartfelt proclamation. Confused and startled, Kurisu will struggle to make sense of Rintaro's words and intentions.
