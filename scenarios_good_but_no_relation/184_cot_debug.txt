Plan: This conversation seems to take place during a tense and critical situation. Given Rintaro's statement about saving someone, it could be inferred this is happening during one of the later stages of the series, where Rintaro and Kurisu are trying to save Mayuri's life, or during the final stages where Rintaro is trying to save Kurisu's life. 

Scenario: In a dire turn of events, Rintaro and Kurisu find themselves in a desperate situation, with one of them severely injured. This is likely during the latter half of the series, where Rintaro's attempts to undo the D-mails or save Kurisu have resulted in a dangerous situation. In the immediate future, Kurisu will try to stabilize the situation by calling for medical help, while Rintaro prepares to act on his decision to save the one he cares about.
