 After successfully manipulating the timeline and reaching the elusive Steins Gate, Rintaro and Kurisu encounter each other in the streets of Akihabara, both feeling a powerful sense of déjà vu. Kurisu is grateful towards Rintaro, not fully understanding why but feeling an intense need to thank him for saving her life. As they interact, they will experience fragments of their shared memories from other timelines, confusing them and making their conversation a jumbled mix of relief, gratitude, and uncertainty.
