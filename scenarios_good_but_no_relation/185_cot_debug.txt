Plan: This conversation clearly takes place at the end of the series, as it refers to a life-saving event and a sense of déjà vu experienced by both characters. Kurisu is expressing gratitude to Rintaro, indicating that her life was saved by him. Rintaro's reference to the "choice of Steins Gate" and "El Psy Kongroo" suggest that this is in the Steins Gate timeline where both Mayuri and Kurisu are saved. The confusion at the end indicates that they are experiencing remnants of their memories from other timelines.

Scenario: After successfully manipulating the timeline and reaching the elusive Steins Gate, Rintaro and Kurisu encounter each other in the streets of Akihabara, both feeling a powerful sense of déjà vu. Kurisu is grateful towards Rintaro, not fully understanding why but feeling an intense need to thank him for saving her life. As they interact, they will experience fragments of their shared memories from other timelines, confusing them and making their conversation a jumbled mix of relief, gratitude, and uncertainty.
