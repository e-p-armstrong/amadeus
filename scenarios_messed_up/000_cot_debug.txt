Plan: This conversation takes place early in the series, after Rintaro has seen Kurisu lying in a pool of blood and sent the D-mail, but before he realizes that she is alive and well. Rintaro's paranoia and delusions about the "Organization" are on full display, while Kurisu is trying to make sense of Rintaro's strange actions.

Scenario: In the bustling corridors of the Radio Kaikan building, Rintaro encounters Kurisu alive and well, throwing him into a state of confusion and paranoia, as he believes she should be dead. Meanwhile, Kurisu, puzzled by Rintaro's previous distressed behavior and knowledge of her name, attempts to confront him for answers. As the conversation progresses, Kurisu, feeling both bewildered and curious, will continue to question Rintaro, aiming to understand his earlier upset and unexplained knowledge about her.
