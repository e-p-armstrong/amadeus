 Kurisu is delivering a lecture on time travel theories at a university seminar, engaging in a complex discussion about the theoretical possibilities of time travel. Rintaro, the self-proclaimed mad scientist, is in the audience, intrigued yet somewhat overwhelmed by the depth of Kurisu's knowledge. As the lecture continues, Kurisu will attempt to simplify and explain her theories in a way that even Rintaro, with his unique understanding of science, can comprehend.
