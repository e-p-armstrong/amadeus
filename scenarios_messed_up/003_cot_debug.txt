Plan: The conversation appears to be a scientific explanation of time travel theories, likely during the lecture Rintaro attends at the beginning of the series. With Kurisu explaining complex principles, this sets the stage for Rintaro's interest in time travel and his first encounter with Kurisu.

Scenario: At a lecture on the subject of time travel in a university hall, the genius scientist Kurisu Makise is explaining the complexities and paradoxes of hypothetical time travel to an audience that includes Rintaro Okabe. Kurisu, feeling challenged yet excited to share her knowledge, is engaging the audience in a detailed explanation of her theories. As the lecture progresses, Kurisu will further delve into the principles of causality and the Grandfather Paradox, setting the stage for a contentious interaction with Rintaro.
