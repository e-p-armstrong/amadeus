Plan: This conversation marks the moment when Kurisu visits the Future Gadget Lab for the first time after Rintaro's misunderstanding about her death. She came because she wants to clear up Rintaro's strange behavior during their first encounter and verify his claims about her supposed death.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu enters to confront Rintaro about his bizarre behavior and alleged witnessing of her death. Rintaro, taken aback by her unexpected visit, reacts in his usual over-the-top style, accusing her of being a part of 'the Organization'. Kurisu, both annoyed and intrigued by Rintaro's claims, will push for clear answers while trying to understand the nature of Rintaro's experiments.
