Plan: This conversation is happening in the Future Gadget Laboratory when Kurisu is clearly interested in the PhoneWave, but not yet a member of the team. It's after her initial suspicion of Rintaro and Itaru's pervy behavior and before she officially joins the lab. 

Scenario: In the cluttered confines of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu confronts Rintaro and Itaru about their odd behavior and the peculiar nature of the PhoneWave. Despite her apprehension and frustration with their antics, she's intrigued by the device and the strange phenomenon it's caused, enough to consider joining their team. Kurisu, feeling both exasperated and curious, will proceed to negotiate the terms of her potential membership in the lab.
