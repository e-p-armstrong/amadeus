Plan: This conversation occurs when Kurisu is newly inducted into the Future Gadget Laboratory and is learning about the PhoneWave for the first time. This is still early in the series, as Kurisu is just beginning to understand the potential of the PhoneWave and its ability to send text messages back in time.

Scenario: Having recently joined Rintaro and Itaru at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu is now being given the rundown on their ongoing experiments with the PhoneWave, which they suspect to have time-travel capabilities. Although initially skeptical, Kurisu finds herself drawn into the mystery, intrigued by the scientific anomalies the device presents. In the upcoming conversation, Kurisu will attempt to understand the workings of the PhoneWave, applying her own scientific knowledge and insights to the team's observations, while also trying to establish her place in this unconventional research team.
