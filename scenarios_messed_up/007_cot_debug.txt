Plan: This conversation is clearly from the early part of the story, after Rintaro has discovered Kurisu alive and well following his text message about her "death". The mention of Doctor Nakabachi's presentation and the email Rintaro sent gives away the timeline.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Itaru, and Kurisu are discussing the events surrounding Doctor Nakabachi's cancelled presentation, which Rintaro and Mayuri had attended. Kurisu, having been confronted by Rintaro about their previous, bloody encounter, is feeling puzzled and is trying to piece together the strange happenings. She will soon question Rintaro about the alarming content of the email he sent to Itaru, which claimed she had been stabbed.
