Plan: This conversation appears to be taking place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, with Rintaro, Itaru, Kurisu, and Mayuri all present. Given the mention of the 'gelbanas' and them sending a message, we can determine that this is part of the series where they are experimenting with the PhoneWave. Kurisu's remarks to Rintaro indicate her annoyance at being referred to as his assistant, implying she has recently joined the lab and is still getting used to her role.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu finds herself being unexpectedly roped into an experiment involving the PhoneWave, as Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri test its ability to send messages into the past. The atmosphere is tense and filled with anticipation, with Mayuri's concern over her bananas adding a touch of humor to the situation. Frustrated at being labeled as Rintaro's assistant, Kurisu will proceed to bicker with him while simultaneously participating in the experiment.
