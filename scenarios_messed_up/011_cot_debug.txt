Plan: This conversation happens when Kurisu is still new to the Future Gadget Laboratory and is still getting used to Rintaro's personality. The mention of the satellite and the PhoneWave suggests that this conversation occurs after Kurisu has joined the lab and Rintaro and his friends have discovered that the PhoneWave can send messages to the past.

Scenario: In the early stages of their acquaintance, Kurisu stops by the Future Gadget Laboratory, where she finds Rintaro immersed in his intricate world of conspiracy theories and scientific exploration. The tension and unfamiliarity between them is palpable as Kurisu tries to understand Rintaro's eccentric behavior and the workings of the lab. Curious yet skeptical, Kurisu is about to question Rintaro about their unexpected results with the PhoneWave, attempting to rationalize their findings.
