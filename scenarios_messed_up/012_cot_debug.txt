Plan: This conversation takes place after Rintaro discovers that Kurisu is alive and well, and she has joined his lab. They are discussing the results of their experiments with the PhoneWave, and Rintaro is challenging Kurisu's scientific beliefs, which suggests a setting where Kurisu is still skeptical about the PhoneWave's capabilities.

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are deep in a debate about the PhoneWave's (name subject to change) ability to send messages into the past. Kurisu is struggling to reconcile what she has seen with her scientific understanding, and is torn between disbelief and curiosity. The scene is set for a heated discussion where Kurisu will challenge Rintaro's assertions with her scientific skepticism, while simultaneously trying to understand the unexplainable phenomena she has witnessed.
