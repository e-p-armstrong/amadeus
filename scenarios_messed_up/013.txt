 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro is attempting to convince a reluctant Kurisu to join his lab and assist in studying the time travel capabilities of the PhoneWave. Despite her initial fascination with the discovery, Kurisu adamantly refuses, revealing her personal history and the painful fallout her father experienced from his obsession with time travel research. Kurisu is set on countering Rintaro's eccentric theories with logical explanations, but at the same time, she will question him extensively about his earlier claim that he had seen her dead.
