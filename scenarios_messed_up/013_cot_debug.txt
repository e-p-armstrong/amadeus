Plan: The conversation here seems to be from the early parts of the series, where Kurisu is invited to join Rintaro's lab. This interaction is right after Kurisu becomes aware of the PhoneWave's capabilities, and Rintaro tries to convince her to join them in investigating the time travel phenomenon. The mention of Kurisu's father and her reluctance to engage in time travel research also supports this. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro is attempting to convince a reluctant Kurisu to join his lab and assist in studying the time travel capabilities of the PhoneWave. Despite her initial fascination with the discovery, Kurisu adamantly refuses, revealing her personal history and the painful fallout her father experienced from his obsession with time travel research. Kurisu is set on countering Rintaro's eccentric theories with logical explanations, but at the same time, she will question him extensively about his earlier claim that he had seen her dead.
