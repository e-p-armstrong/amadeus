Plan: This is one of the initial meetings between Rintaro and Kurisu where he starts to trust her a little bit. Rintaro's paranoia about "the Organization" and his suspicion that Kurisu is part of it, as well as his reference to the IBN 5100 and SERN, place this conversation early in the story. 

Scenario: After Rintaro discovers that Kurisu is alive, despite his initial message about her death, and she joins him in the Future Gadget Laboratory, they find themselves in a tense conversation where Rintaro's paranoia surfaces. Kurisu, still trying to understand Rintaro's eccentric behavior and his claims about SERN and the IBN 5100, is determined to get to the bottom of this mystery. Despite Rintaro's challenging demeanor, Kurisu will persist in her quest for answers about the connection between the IBN 5100 and SERN.
