 At the house of Luka, Rintaro and Kurisu are engaged in a somewhat heated exchange over how Rintaro introduces Kurisu. They have been working together for a while now, and their playful bickering has become a common occurrence, despite Kurisu's continued annoyance at Rintaro's antics. Kurisu, feeling frustrated but also slightly amused, will continue to argue with Rintaro, challenging him on his choice of words and demanding a proper introduction.
