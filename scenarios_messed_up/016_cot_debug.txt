Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place at Luka's house, as they're talking to Luka and his father. Rintaro is introducing Kurisu to them, and they're about to ask Luka's father for something important. Since they're talking to Luka's father, this might be happening during the part of the story where Rintaro is trying to undo the D-mails.

Scenario: At the house of Luka, Rintaro and Kurisu are engaged in a somewhat heated exchange over how Rintaro introduces Kurisu. They have been working together for a while now, and their playful bickering has become a common occurrence, despite Kurisu's continued annoyance at Rintaro's antics. Kurisu, feeling frustrated but also slightly amused, will continue to argue with Rintaro, challenging him on his choice of words and demanding a proper introduction.
