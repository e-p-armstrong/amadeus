Plan: From the conversation, it seems Kurisu, Rintaro, and Luka are engaged in some physical task, possibly related to their experiments in the lab. This is likely during the period where they are working on perfecting the PhoneWave. The presence of Luka and the reference to "borrowing a push cart" suggests that this conversation takes place at the Yanabayashi Shrine, where Luka lives. 

Scenario: Kurisu, Rintaro, and Luka are at the Yanabayashi Shrine, working on transporting a heavy piece of equipment related to their PhoneWave experiments. This is a scene of camaraderie and light-hearted banter as they navigate the challenges of their experiment. As the conversation unfolds, Kurisu will grapple with the physical demands of science outside of her usual theoretical work, while trying to maintain her dignity and assert her boundaries.
