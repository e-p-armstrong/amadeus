 Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Kurisu have just returned from a day out in Akihabara where Mayuri's knowledge of the area proved invaluable. As the evening draws in, Mayuri prepares to head home and invites Kurisu to join her, but Kurisu, feeling a sense of commitment to their work and perhaps a desire for a private conversation with Rintaro, decides to stay behind. In the quiet lab, Kurisu plans to continue working on the PhoneWave or discuss important matters with Rintaro.
