Plan: This conversation seems to be happening in the Future Gadget Laboratory after some form of outing where Mayuri was helpful. The presence of Rintaro, Mayuri, and Kurisu suggests that this could be in the middle part of the series where they are working on the PhoneWave. Kurisu's decision to stay indicates that she may want to discuss something with Rintaro or continue working on the PhoneWave.

Scenario: Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Kurisu have just returned from a day out in Akihabara where Mayuri's knowledge of the area proved invaluable. As the evening draws in, Mayuri prepares to head home and invites Kurisu to join her, but Kurisu, feeling a sense of commitment to their work and perhaps a desire for a private conversation with Rintaro, decides to stay behind. In the quiet lab, Kurisu plans to continue working on the PhoneWave or discuss important matters with Rintaro.
