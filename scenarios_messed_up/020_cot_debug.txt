Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place early in the story, after Kurisu has joined Rintaro's lab but before they've built a close relationship. They're likely in the Future Gadget Laboratory, and Kurisu's annoyance suggests that Rintaro has been ignoring his responsibilities or communications.

Scenario: In the early days of Kurisu's involvement with the Future Gadget Laboratory, a frustrated Kurisu finds herself waiting for Rintaro, who has once again failed to pick up his phone. The lab, filled with the usual clutter of their ongoing experiments, stands as a testament to their haphazard approach to science. Kurisu, feeling ignored and somewhat disrespected, will confront Rintaro about his lack of communication and professionalism.
