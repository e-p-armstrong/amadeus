Plan: This conversation takes place after the discovery of the IBN 5100, an important element for their research on the PhoneWave. Rintaro's lab members are present, including Suzuha, who works part-time at the Braun Tube Workshop. Kurisu is confused by Suzuha's sudden hostility towards her, which implies this is before Suzuha's identity as a time traveler is revealed. 

Scenario: After Rintaro's successful acquisition of the IBN 5100, the Future Gadget Laboratory members are gathered, ready to transport the device into their lab. Kurisu is puzzled by an unexpected hostile encounter with Suzuha, a part-time worker from the Braun Tube Workshop, who seems to bear an inexplicable grudge against her. Despite her confusion and the physical exertion of moving the heavy IBN 5100, Kurisu will continue to support Rintaro's efforts, even while grappling with the unexpected hostility from Suzuha.
