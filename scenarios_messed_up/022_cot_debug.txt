Plan: This conversation takes place after Rintaro and his friends have discovered that the Phone Microwave can send text messages to the past and SERN has gotten involved. The tension and mentions of SERN suggest that they're in the middle of the conflict with the organization. Kurisu's threatening to turn Rintaro over to the police suggests she's not fully aware of the gravity of the situation yet.

Scenario: In the cluttered Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are in the midst of a tense conversation about their unexpected enemy, SERN. The atmosphere is charged as Rintaro references the ongoing "war" against SERN, causing a skeptical and somewhat frustrated Kurisu to question his motives and seriousness. Determined to understand Rintaro's intentions, Kurisu will persistently press him for answers, while also grappling with the new reality of their dangerous situation.
