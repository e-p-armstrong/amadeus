Plan: In this conversation, Kurisu is questioning Rintaro and Itaru about their claims about SERN's involvement in time travel research and the role of the IBN 5100 in decrypting SERN's database. This conversation likely takes place after Kurisu has joined the Future Gadget Laboratory and is taking part in the research and experiments with Rintaro and Itaru. Given the topic of the conversation, it seems like it's following the initial discovery of the potential of the PhoneWave for time travel.

Scenario: In the midst of their research at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, still skeptical, challenges Rintaro and Itaru to provide concrete evidence about SERN's secret time travel research and the crucial role of the IBN 5100. The mood is tense, but there's also a sense of excitement and anticipation - they're on the verge of uncovering something potentially earth-shattering. Curiosity piqued, Kurisu will now probe deeper into their experiments and theories, pushing them to validate their claims.
