Plan: This conversation is a scientific exchange between Kurisu and Rintaro about the Phone Microwave. Kurisu is questioning Rintaro about the settings of the device, and they are attempting to replicate the "discharge phenomenon." This implies that they are in the research phase of the time travel experiments, after Kurisu has joined the lab but before they have perfected the method. 

Scenario: Kurisu and Rintaro are in the Future Gadget Lab, surrounded by the chaotic clutter of their ongoing experiments on the PhoneWave. Having recently joined the lab, Kurisu's curiosity and scientific rigor are driving her to understand the inconsistent results they've been getting from the device. She will continue to question Rintaro about the conditions of the experiments, seeking to identify the variables that might be affecting the outcome.
