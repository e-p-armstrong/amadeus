Plan: This conversation takes place when the group is investigating SERN's secret experiments and their relation with the IBN 5100. Given the reference to the Z Program and the Committee of 300, it likely occurs after they have started sending D-mails and when they are starting to discover the darker implications of time travel.

Scenario: The Future Gadget Laboratory team is knee-deep in their investigation into the mysterious SERN organization and their connection to the elusive IBN 5100. Having uncovered a cryptic document, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are deciphering its contents, revealing SERN's secret plans and hinting at a shadowy Committee of 300. Overwhelmed by the revelation that SERN has been conducting time-space displacement experiments, Kurisu will try to make sense of the information, while battling her disbelief and a growing sense of unease.
