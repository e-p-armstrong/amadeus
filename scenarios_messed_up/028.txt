 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, the team is deep into a session of decoding and discussing SERN's Z Program, having uncovered its existence through their experiments with the PhoneWave. Kurisu, intrigued and concerned about the implications of the Z Program, is reading through the report, while Rintaro is performatively acting out his mad scientist persona, in an attempt to lighten the mood. As they delve deeper into the Z Program, Kurisu will start to question Rintaro's motivations, trying to compel him to drop his mad scientist act and confront the seriousness of the situation.
