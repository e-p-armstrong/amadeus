Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place after Kurisu has joined the Future Gadget Lab, but before the SERN raid. The characters are discussing the Z Program, which suggests they have started digging into SERN's plans. Kurisu and Itaru are more focused on the information, while Rintaro is still in his "Hououin Kyouma" persona, indicating that this scene may occur before the time-leaping to save Mayuri starts.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, the team is deep into a session of decoding and discussing SERN's Z Program, having uncovered its existence through their experiments with the PhoneWave. Kurisu, intrigued and concerned about the implications of the Z Program, is reading through the report, while Rintaro is performatively acting out his mad scientist persona, in an attempt to lighten the mood. As they delve deeper into the Z Program, Kurisu will start to question Rintaro's motivations, trying to compel him to drop his mad scientist act and confront the seriousness of the situation.
