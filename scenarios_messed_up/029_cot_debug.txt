Plan: This conversation takes place after Rintaro and his friends have discovered that the Phone Microwave can send text messages to the past. They have been experimenting with this technology but after discovering the Jellyman's Report, Rintaro is worried about the implications of their actions and tries to dissuade Kurisu from continuing with their experiments. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Lab, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru have just stumbled upon the Jellyman's Report, a gruesome revelation of human experimentation by SERN, using a similar time travel technology. Rintaro, fearing for their safety and the potential consequences of their experiments, is pleading with Kurisu to abandon their work and secure her future. Despite the risks, Kurisu will decide to stay and uncover the truth behind SERN's experiments, pushing the group further into dangerous territory.
