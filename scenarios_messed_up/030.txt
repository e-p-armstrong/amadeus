 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are engrossed in a deep conversation about SERN's time travel experiments, which they've discovered through their hacking efforts. As they discuss the possible implications of Kerr black holes and proton compression, Kurisu finds herself both intrigued and horrified by the scientific theory behind SERN's experiments. Armed with this newfound knowledge, Kurisu will attempt to further decode SERN's time travel theory and its highly dangerous potential consequences.
