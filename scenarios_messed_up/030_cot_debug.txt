Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place after Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru have hacked into SERN and discovered their time travel research. Kurisu's dialogue suggests that they are discussing the scientific principles behind SERN's time travel experimentation, and the mention of John Titor places this scenario after the characters have interacted with Titor online.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are engrossed in a deep conversation about SERN's time travel experiments, which they've discovered through their hacking efforts. As they discuss the possible implications of Kerr black holes and proton compression, Kurisu finds herself both intrigued and horrified by the scientific theory behind SERN's experiments. Armed with this newfound knowledge, Kurisu will attempt to further decode SERN's time travel theory and its highly dangerous potential consequences.
