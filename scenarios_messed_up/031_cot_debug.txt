Plan: The context of this conversation is a detailed discussion about the theoretical aspects of time travel, specifically black holes, event horizons, and the concept of a Kerr black hole's ring singularity. This conversation likely occurs after the group has discovered the potential of the Phone Microwave as a time machine and are now trying to understand the science behind it. 

Scenario: Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro and Itaru are deep in discussion about the science of time travel, having discovered that the Phone Microwave can send messages to the past. Kurisu, the resident expert, is explaining the complex concepts of black holes, event horizons and singularities to Rintaro and Itaru. As the conversation progresses, Kurisu will try to make the group understand the intricacies of time travel and the challenges faced by SERN in their attempts to create a true naked singularity.
