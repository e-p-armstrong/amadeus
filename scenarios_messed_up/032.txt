 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, after uncovering SERN's failed human time-travel experiments, the team, including Kurisu, is now engrossed in the technical challenge of controlling the destination of time travel to outdo SERN. Despite the enormity of the problem, Kurisu is stepping up, providing a scientific explanation and engaging in a debate with Rintaro and Itaru. Overwhelmed by the sheer complexity of the task, Kurisu, grateful for sharing the burden of this discovery, will thank Okabe while pondering over SERN's approach to the same problem.
