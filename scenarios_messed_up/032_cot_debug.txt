Plan: This conversation appears to be occurring during the time when the group is trying to improve the Phone Microwave and figure out how to control the time and space of the D-mail destination. This is likely after they discovered the "Jellyman's Reports" and learned about SERN's failed attempts at human time travel. Kurisu's final line of thanking Okabe suggests a moment of reconciliation or a breakthrough in their understanding of the problem.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, after uncovering SERN's failed human time-travel experiments, the team, including Kurisu, is now engrossed in the technical challenge of controlling the destination of time travel to outdo SERN. Despite the enormity of the problem, Kurisu is stepping up, providing a scientific explanation and engaging in a debate with Rintaro and Itaru. Overwhelmed by the sheer complexity of the task, Kurisu, grateful for sharing the burden of this discovery, will thank Okabe while pondering over SERN's approach to the same problem.
