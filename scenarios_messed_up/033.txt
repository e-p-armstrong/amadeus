 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Itaru are deeply immersed in a discussion about SERN and the secrets of time travel, having discovered the ability to send D-mails through the PhoneWave. Kurisu, despite her initial hesitation, is now a provisional member of the lab, aiding in their research while maintaining a skeptical perspective. In this conversation, Kurisu will begin to share her findings about SERN's time travel experiments, which will lead to a better understanding of the PhoneWave's capabilities and the path to its improvement.
