Plan: This conversation takes place in the Future Gadget Laboratory and involves Kurisu, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Itaru. They are discussing SERN and their experiments, which indicates that they have discovered the D-mails and are in the process of understanding and improving the PhoneWave. Kurisu's comment about being a temporary lab member suggests that she has joined the lab, but she's not fully committed yet.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Itaru are deeply immersed in a discussion about SERN and the secrets of time travel, having discovered the ability to send D-mails through the PhoneWave. Kurisu, despite her initial hesitation, is now a provisional member of the lab, aiding in their research while maintaining a skeptical perspective. In this conversation, Kurisu will begin to share her findings about SERN's time travel experiments, which will lead to a better understanding of the PhoneWave's capabilities and the path to its improvement.
