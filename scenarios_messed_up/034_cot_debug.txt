Plan: This conversation is taking place after Kurisu has joined Rintaro's lab and they have discovered the Phone Microwave's ability to send text messages to the past. They are in the process of refining their understanding of the device and its capabilities. 

Scenario: In the lab, Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri are in the midst of a deep discussion about the theory behind the time-travelling emails. A sense of camaraderie and shared curiosity fills the room, though it is punctuated by Rintaro's eccentricity and Kurisu's scientific rigor. Feeling a bit exasperated but also amused, Kurisu will next engage in a light-hearted debate about what to name this new time-traveling email phenomenon.
