 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Itaru, Kurisu, and Mayuri are in the midst of a lively technical discussion about the PhoneWave and the newly named D-Mails. Having established a rapport with the group, Kurisu is actively participating in the brainstorming, albeit with her usual blend of sarcasm and seriousness. With a focus on uncovering the mysteries of the PhoneWave, Kurisu is set to challenge Rintaro's theories and lead the group towards practical experiments, all while maintaining a light-hearted atmosphere with her occasional clumsy antics.
