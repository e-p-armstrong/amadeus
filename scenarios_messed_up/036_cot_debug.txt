Plan: This conversation is taking place during the time when Rintaro, Kurisu and Itaru are conducting experiments with D-mails using the PhoneWave. The group is in the lab and they're discussing how the D-mails are being sent and received. Kurisu is actively participating in the experiments and seems to be taking a leadership role in the process.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru are deep into their experiments with the PhoneWave, attempting to understand the peculiarities of sending D-Mails. Amidst the eccentric banter and camaraderie, Kurisu is showing her assertive side, taking charge of the experiment and directing the others. In the upcoming conversation, Kurisu will continue to lead the experiments, focusing on solving the mystery of the D-mails' anomalies, despite Rintaro's theatrics.
