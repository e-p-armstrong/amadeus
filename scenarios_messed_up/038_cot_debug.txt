Plan: This conversation is quite technical and focuses on the mechanics of the PhoneWave, suggesting that they are in the process of understanding and refining the time machine. The involvement of all main characters indicates this conversation is happening after Kurisu has joined the lab as a member, but before the major crises of the story. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri are deeply involved in a discussion about the PhoneWave's operational principles and the limitations of its data transmission. With their focus on technical details, Kurisu's comfort with the team is evident, and she is fully engaged in helping solve the machine's mysteries. Displaying her scientific rigor, Kurisu will challenge and dissect the theories being presented, guiding the team toward a deeper understanding of their device.
