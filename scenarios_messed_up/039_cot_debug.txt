Plan: This conversation is centered on the limitations and advancements regarding the PhoneWave. Given that the group has already perfected the art of D-Mailing and are now discussing the possibility of sending humans through time, this is likely to be taking place in the middle of the story after they have discovered the D-Mail but before Mayuri's death. 

Scenario: Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri are in the midst of a profound discussion concerning the capabilities of the PhoneWave and its potential for human time travel. As they grapple with the limitations and the ethical implications of their newfound power, Kurisu's scientific curiosity and her pursuit of knowledge are clearly evident. Going forward, Kurisu will advocate for further investigation into the PhoneWave to gain a deeper understanding of its mysterious phenomena.
