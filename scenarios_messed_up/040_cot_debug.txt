Plan: This conversation occurs after the discovery of the PhoneWave's time travel capability but before they've fully understood how it works. It's a moment of tension between Kurisu and Rintaro, as they debate about the nature of their discovery and its implications. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, the team, including Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru, has just discovered that their PhoneWave can send messages into the past, albeit accidentally. Kurisu, initially a skeptic of time travel, is grappling with this unsettling realization and is engaged in an argument with Rintaro about the validity of their accidental discovery. Though skeptical, Kurisu will continue to question the nature of the PhoneWave, aiming to uncover the scientific truth behind its time-bending abilities.
