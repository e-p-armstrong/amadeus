Plan: This conversation likely takes place at the Future Gadget Lab, after the team has discovered the time-travel capabilities of the Phone Microwave but before the threat of SERN becomes prominent. The characters are discussing resuming their experiments, suggesting they are exploring the capabilities of the microwave and the potential of the D-mails.

Scenario: Kurisu, Mayuri, and Rintaro are at the Future Gadget Lab, having recently discovered that their Phone Microwave can send text messages to the past. Despite the concerns of their landlord, Mister Braun, about the building shaking due to their experiments, they plan to continue their tests. Kurisu, being practical and a little exasperated by Rintaro's convoluted logic, will attempt to persuade him to be more cautious and considerate.
