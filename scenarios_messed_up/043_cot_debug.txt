Plan: Given the conversation's content and the characters involved, this is likely in the Future Gadget Laboratory, during the period where the team is working on improving the PhoneWave. This seems to be a casual conversation interspersed with their usual playful bickering, suggesting it's during a peaceful time before the SERN crisis. It appears to be after Moeka has joined the lab, and the group is discussing an upgrade to the PhoneWave. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, Mayuri, and Moeka are in the midst of renaming their upgraded PhoneWave and preparing for a new round of experiments. Kurisu, ever the pragmatist, is growing weary of their playful banter and is eager to proceed with the experiment. Despite her irritation, Kurisu will find herself drawn into their teasing, reluctantly participating in their lightheartedness and further bonding with the group.
