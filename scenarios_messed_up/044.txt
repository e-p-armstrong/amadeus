 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are in the midst of another day of fine-tuning the Phone Microwave. Having become an integral part of the research team, Kurisu is eager to make sense of the mysterious phenomena they are dealing with, and is questioning the details of their experiments. Despite Rintaro's dismissive response, Kurisu, feeling determined and a little annoyed, will continue to challenge him and seek clarity on their research findings.
