Plan: This conversation suggests that they are discussing the details of their experimentation with the Phone Microwave. The fact that Kurisu is questioning the specifics of the experiment indicates that she has already joined the lab and is actively involved in their research. Rintaro's teasing of Kurisu as his assistant, and her denial of it, suggests that they have developed a comfortable and playful dynamic.

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are in the midst of another day of fine-tuning the Phone Microwave. Having become an integral part of the research team, Kurisu is eager to make sense of the mysterious phenomena they are dealing with, and is questioning the details of their experiments. Despite Rintaro's dismissive response, Kurisu, feeling determined and a little annoyed, will continue to challenge him and seek clarity on their research findings.
