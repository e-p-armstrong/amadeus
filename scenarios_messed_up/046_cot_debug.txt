Plan: This conversation is happening in the Future Gadget Laboratory. Rintaro and Kurisu are discussing the potential use of the PhoneWave's ability to send D-mails, and it's clear they have tested it out at least once. The mention of trying to win the lottery suggests it takes place after the first successful D-mail but before the more serious consequences of time alteration become apparent.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu is challenging Rintaro's plan to use the PhoneWave's newfound time-altering capabilities for personal gain. In this relatively light-hearted scene, the team is still unaware of the severe consequences their time-altering experiments will bring. Despite her initial skepticism, Kurisu will soon engage in brainstorming a safe and trivial change to the past, indicating her growing involvement in the team's experiments.
