 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and the other lab members are in the midst of an informal conversation, taking a break from their research on the PhoneWave. Rintaro's use of her nickname "Celeb Seventeen" indicates that they're still in the process of getting to know each other better, leading to playful banter. Kurisu, slightly annoyed but tolerant, will retort to Rintaro's teasing while trying to maintain a level of professional distance.
