 In the midst of their time travel experiments at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Mayuri ponder over the possibilities of using D-mails, specifically the concept of sending lottery numbers from the future.

With this train of thought, Kurisu will continue to explore the theoretical consequences of their time travel experiments.
