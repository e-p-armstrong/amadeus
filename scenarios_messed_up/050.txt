 In the midst of a discussion at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are once again debating the theory behind "Steins Gate", a concept which Rintaro remains cryptic about. The pair are in a phase where they've already started working together to understand the Phone Microwave's time-travel capabilities, and their relationship has developed into one where they can engage in deep scientific discussions. Frustrated by Rintaro's vague explanations, Kurisu will press him for more concrete information about his elusive concept of "Steins Gate".
