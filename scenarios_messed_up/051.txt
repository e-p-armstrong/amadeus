 Kurisu, Rintaro, and Mayuri are in the Future Gadget Laboratory, having recently discovered the power of D-mails. Rintaro, excited by a D-mail's potential to change the past, is checking if he's won the lottery, while Kurisu is still trying to understand the concept and implications of D-mails. Kurisu, initially dismissing Rintaro's antics, will soon realize the gravity of the situation and start seriously investigating the changes caused by the D-mail.
