Plan: This conversation takes place after Rintaro, Kurisu, and the rest of the team discover the ability to send D-mails. Rintaro's reference to "LOTO SIX" signifies that he's realizing the potential of these D-mails to alter events in the past. Kurisu's confusion about the topic indicates that this is one of the first instances of a D-mail changing the timeline.

Scenario: Kurisu, Rintaro, and Mayuri are in the Future Gadget Laboratory, having recently discovered the power of D-mails. Rintaro, excited by a D-mail's potential to change the past, is checking if he's won the lottery, while Kurisu is still trying to understand the concept and implications of D-mails. Kurisu, initially dismissing Rintaro's antics, will soon realize the gravity of the situation and start seriously investigating the changes caused by the D-mail.
