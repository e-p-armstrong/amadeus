Plan: This seems to be a conversation probably after Rintaro has sent a D-Mail that has altered the timeline significantly. The fact that Kurisu has no memory of an event Rintaro distinctly recalls is indicative of a major timeline shift. 

Scenario: Amidst the clutter and chaos of the Future Gadget Lab, Rintaro has just sent another D-Mail, altering the timeline once again. Having no memory of this event due to the shift, Kurisu is confused and disoriented, doubting her own observations. As Rintaro tries to explain, Kurisu will struggle to understand the implications of the D-Mail and the changes it has brought, while grappling with the unsettling feeling of missing memories.
