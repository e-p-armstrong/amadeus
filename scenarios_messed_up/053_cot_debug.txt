Plan: The conversation here is similar to the previous one, with playful banter between Kurisu and Itaru. It's likely taking place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, during a period of relative calm when they are working on the Phone Microwave. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are once again immersed in their research on the PhoneWave. Kurisu's banter suggests she is more comfortable and involved with the team, even engaging in their playful teasing. Despite her exasperation, Kurisu will continue to challenge Itaru's self-proclaimed title of a 'pervy gentleman', in an attempt to maintain a semblance of professionalism amidst the group's antics.
