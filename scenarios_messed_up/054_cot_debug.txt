Plan: This lengthy conversation between Kurisu and Rintaro indicates a point in the series where they are already familiar with each other and the concept of D-Mail. Kurisu is questioning the validity of Rintaro's claims about his ability to remember changes in the timeline. This occurs after the discovery of D-Mail but before the major conflicts with SERN, so the conversation is likely taking place in the Future Gadget Laboratory. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are deep into a late-night discussion, with Kurisu challenging the logic behind Rintaro's 'Reading Steiner' ability. Despite the usual banter, there's a sense of discomfort as Rintaro appears unusually gloomy. In this scene, Kurisu will continue to probe Rintaro's claims about changing the past with a mix of skepticism and concern.
