Plan: This interaction happens at the Future Gadget Laboratory, after Rintaro and Kurisu have become comfortable with each other enough to engage in banter. Rintaro is grinning because he is talking to John Titor online, and Kurisu is questioning him about it.

Scenario: Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and Rintaro are taking a break from their usual research on the Phone Microwave. Rintaro is engrossed in an online conversation with John Titor, a self-proclaimed time traveler, causing him to sport an uncharacteristic grin. Kurisu, noticing his unusual behavior, will proceed to tease him and question him about his interaction with John Titor and his belief in Titor's claims.
