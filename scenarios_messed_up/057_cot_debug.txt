Plan: Given the discussion about D-Mails, memories, and changing the past, this conversation likely occurs after Rintaro and his friends have discovered the potential of the Phone Microwave to change the past. The mention of Daru sending a D-Mail and Faris suggests this happens during their period of experimentation with D-Mails, before they attract SERN's attention. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, the group is deep into their experimentation with the PhoneWave, sending D-Mails and observing their effects on the timeline. Amidst the trials, Kurisu is intrigued yet skeptical about the concept of changing past events and how memories are retained. Moving forward, she resolves to question Rintaro further about his unique 'Reading Steiner' ability, refusing to send a D-Mail herself due to her belief in accepting her past as it is.
