 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru have begun another day of experimenting with the PhoneWave, interrupted by a brief interaction with a part-timer downstairs. Kurisu, despite her growing familiarity and comfort with the team, is still attempting to balance being part of the lab's camaraderie while maintaining her scientific integrity and dedication. In the midst of this casual conversation, Kurisu will continue to assert her grounded, pragmatic perspective, both defending her choices and challenging the lab's eccentric practices.
