 Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, the team, including Kurisu, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Itaru, are experimenting with sending D-mails using the PhoneWave. They are trying to determine the precise conditions under which the machine works, and are using Mayuri's indecisiveness about canned food as a test case. Kurisu, feeling intrigued and slightly amused by the team's unconventional approach, will continue to analyze the results of their experiments to better understand the workings of the PhoneWave.
