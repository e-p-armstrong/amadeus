Plan: Given the conversation about the PhoneWave and D-mails, this is when the team is experimenting with sending the D-mails. The presence of all the team members and the casual, playful tone suggest this is during a period of initial success with the D-mails, before the major complications arise. Kurisu is in analytical mode, trying to figure out why the discharge didn't occur.

Scenario: Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, the team, including Kurisu, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Itaru, are experimenting with sending D-mails using the PhoneWave. They are trying to determine the precise conditions under which the machine works, and are using Mayuri's indecisiveness about canned food as a test case. Kurisu, feeling intrigued and slightly amused by the team's unconventional approach, will continue to analyze the results of their experiments to better understand the workings of the PhoneWave.
