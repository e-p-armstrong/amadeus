 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and the team are in the midst of a heated discussion about the PhoneWave (name subject to change) experiments and the potential risks associated with sending personal information. Kurisu, playing the role of the voice of reason amidst the chaos, is trying to ensure that the team understands the importance of caution and data collection over personal curiosities. As the debate continues, Kurisu will attempt to convince the group to prioritize the scientific principles of the experiment over their individual desires or fears.
