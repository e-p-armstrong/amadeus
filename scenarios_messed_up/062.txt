 Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru are in the midst of another D-Mail experiment, this time involving Kiryu Moeka. Suddenly, Rintaro realizes that only he remembers Moeka's presence and the D-Mail she sent, while the others are clueless, due to a shift in the timeline. Kurisu, puzzled and somewhat concerned, will try to make sense of the situation and theorize about the potential consequences of time paradoxes caused by D-mails.
