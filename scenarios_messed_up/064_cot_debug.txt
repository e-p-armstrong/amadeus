Plan: The conversation involves multiple characters, including Mayuri, Rintaro, Itaru, Kurisu, and Luka. The mention of cosplay and Luka's shy reaction suggest this is the part of the series where Luka's D-mail wish is being granted, where he wishes to be a girl. Kurisu's reprimand to Rintaro indicates she's trying to protect Luka.

Scenario: The scene is set in the Future Gadget Laboratory, where the gang is granting the wishes of their friends via D-mails. Luka, dressed stylishly, is the center of attention, and Kurisu, initially taken aback by the unusual scene, quickly comes to his defense when she feels Rintaro is being insensitive. As the conversation unfolds, Kurisu will attempt to reassure Luka and confront Rintaro about his insensitivity.
