Plan: This conversation takes place after Kurisu has joined Rintaro's lab, and after the trio have discovered the D-mail function of the PhoneWave. The mention of using D-mail to alter Luka's past suggests that they are discussing possible experiments before the major timeline changes have started to have a traumatic impact. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Mayuri are discussing the potential uses of the PhoneWave's D-mail function, specifically, its ability to alter personal histories. At this point, Kurisu, while still somewhat hesitant about the ethical implications, is increasingly drawn into the thrill of scientific discovery and experimentation. As the conversation progresses, Kurisu will find herself on the defensive, trying to reconcile her innate curiosity and interest in the experiment with her concerns about the potential consequences.
