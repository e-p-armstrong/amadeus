Plan: This conversation seems to occur when Kurisu is feeling overwhelmed by her role in the lab, and is considering handing over her tasks to someone else. The mention of Urushibara-san indicates that Luka is present, which suggests that this is happening after Luka has been introduced to the lab team. This is likely happening at the Future Gadget Laboratory.

Scenario: In the bustling environment of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu is feeling the weight of the tasks she's been handling, trying to perfect the Phone Microwave and manage the unpredictable group of friends. As she seeks to lighten her load by passing her duties onto Urushibara Luka, she's met with a firm denial from Rintaro. Despite her frustration, Kurisu will continue to work diligently on their time-travel innovation, driven by her scientific curiosity and growing attachment to the team.
