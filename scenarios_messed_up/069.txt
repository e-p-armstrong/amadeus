 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and the others are working on an experiment to send D-mails - text messages into the past - using the PhoneWave. They are assisting Luka, who wishes to change his past by sending a message to his mother. Despite the technical aspects of the task, Kurisu will take the time to remind the team about the importance of maintaining a respectful tone in their message.
