Plan: This conversation is happening during the time when they are experimenting with sending D-mails using the Phone Microwave. The discussion about character limits and the bit about Luka's message suggests that this could be the time when they are helping Luka send a message to his past self. 

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and the others are working on an experiment to send D-mails - text messages into the past - using the PhoneWave. They are assisting Luka, who wishes to change his past by sending a message to his mother. Despite the technical aspects of the task, Kurisu will take the time to remind the team about the importance of maintaining a respectful tone in their message.
