Plan: This conversation suggests a moment of vulnerability for Kurisu, which would place it later in the series when she has grown closer to Rintaro and the rest of the Future Gadget Laboratory team. Given the emotional tenor of the conversation and Kurisu's initial upset, this may occur after a major setback or crisis, such as the repeated failures to save Mayuri or the danger posed by SERN. 

Scenario: Sometime after the series of failed attempts to save Mayuri from her fate, Kurisu finds herself in the Future Gadget Lab with Rintaro, overwhelmed by the mounting pressure and the emotional toll of their situation. Feeling deeply hurt, confused, and abandoned, Kurisu confronts Rintaro, accusing him of not wanting her around. Despite her initial denial of her emotional state, Kurisu will eventually let her guard down and admit her distress to Rintaro, who reassures her of their friendship and her importance to them.
