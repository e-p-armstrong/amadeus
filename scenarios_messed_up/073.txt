 Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru are in the Future Gadget Laboratory, deep in discussion about the potential and limitations of their D-Mail technology and the possibility of physical time travel. Kurisu, carrying a sense of realism and caution, is skeptical about the group's capability to surpass SERN's research and is concerned about the repercussions of their actions. As the conversation progresses, Kurisu will continue to question the feasibility of Rintaro's ambitious ideas and propose a safer, more grounded approach to their scientific endeavors.
