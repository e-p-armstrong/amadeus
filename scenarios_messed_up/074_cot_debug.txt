Plan: This conversation is clearly taking place after Kurisu has joined the Future Gadget Laboratory and before the group discovered that SERN has been watching them. It's possible that it's taking place right before they realize SERN's involvement. The final line suggests that Kurisu is starting to take a more active role in the team's activities.

Scenario: In the early days of Kurisu's involvement in the Future Gadget Laboratory, she's learning more about Rintaro and Itaru's hobbies and lifestyles, including their interest in @channel. Despite her initial rejection and annoyance, she's starting to become more involved in their activities, particularly their investigation into SERN. Feeling curious and slightly concerned, Kurisu will ask about the progress on their hacking attempts into SERN's database.
