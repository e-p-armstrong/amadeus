 The Future Gadget Laboratory is a flurry of activity as Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are deep in their investigation of SERN's hidden time travel research. Having become an integral part of the lab, Kurisu is actively contributing to the research while also dealing with Rintaro's eccentricities. Although annoyed by Rintaro's constant teasing, Kurisu is determined to continue working on the translation and will argue against the risky idea of hacking into SERNâ€™s Large Hadron Collider.
