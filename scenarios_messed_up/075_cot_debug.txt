Plan: This conversation takes place after the discovery of SERN’s secret time travel research, and the group is trying to decipher the code in their database. The exchange between Kurisu and Rintaro indicates some familiarity and camaraderie, which suggests this is after Kurisu has joined the lab and is actively working with them. Kurisu's last line suggests some flustered feelings towards Rintaro, indicating this is after they've grown closer.

Scenario: The Future Gadget Laboratory is a flurry of activity as Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are deep in their investigation of SERN's hidden time travel research. Having become an integral part of the lab, Kurisu is actively contributing to the research while also dealing with Rintaro's eccentricities. Although annoyed by Rintaro's constant teasing, Kurisu is determined to continue working on the translation and will argue against the risky idea of hacking into SERN’s Large Hadron Collider.
