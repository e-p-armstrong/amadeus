Plan: This conversation is taking place after the Future Gadget Laboratory team has discovered the ability to send D-Mails and have experimented with it, altering timelines. The mention of the IBN 5100 disappearing indicates that a D-Mail has caused a significant change in the timeline. The conversation is likely taking place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, as that's where most of their discussions and discoveries about time travel occur.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri are in a heated discussion about the sudden disappearance of the IBN 5100, a critical element in their time travel investigations. Kurisu, skeptical yet analytical, is trying to understand the situation in the context of their recent D-Mail experiments and the alterations they've caused in the timeline. As the conversation deepens, Kurisu will methodically question Rintaro, trying to pinpoint when the timeline might have changed and the IBN 5100 disappeared.
