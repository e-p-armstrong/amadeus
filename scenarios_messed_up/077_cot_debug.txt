Plan: This conversation takes place during the period of the story when the group is sending D-mails and changing the past. Given the group's query about Faris and her work schedule, this could be occurring around the time when they are preparing to send a D-mail for Faris. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, the lab members, including Kurisu, are engaged in a discussion about using the PhoneWave to send a D-mail on behalf of their friend, Faris. Kurisu, in her rational and logical manner, attempts to calm the others down and prevent them from jumping to conclusions. In the conversation that follows, Kurisu will find herself baffled and perhaps a little amused by Mayuri's playful, cat-like language when speaking with Faris.
