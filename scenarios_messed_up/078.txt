 Kurisu is at the CRT shop downstairs from Rintaro's Future Gadget Laboratory, where she's observing the PhoneWave (name subject to change). She's still adjusting to Rintaro's constant roleplaying as 'Hououin Kyouma' and is a bit exasperated by it, though she's starting to show signs of getting used to the lab's unusual environment. Kurisu will reluctantly follow Rintaro's request to adjust the PhoneWave's settings for a critical experiment, despite her concerns about upsetting the shop owner, Mr. Braun.
