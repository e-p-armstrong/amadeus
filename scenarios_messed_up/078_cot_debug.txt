Plan: This conversation seems to take place in the early stages of their experimentation with the PhoneWave. Given Kurisu's initial reluctance to deal with Rintaro's 'Hououin Kyouma' persona, and her being in a different location (presumably downstairs, from the mention of 'the guy downstairs'), it's likely that this is a part of the story where Kurisu has joined the lab but is still trying to adjust to Rintaro's eccentricities and the lab's overall situation.

Scenario: Kurisu is at the CRT shop downstairs from Rintaro's Future Gadget Laboratory, where she's observing the PhoneWave (name subject to change). She's still adjusting to Rintaro's constant roleplaying as 'Hououin Kyouma' and is a bit exasperated by it, though she's starting to show signs of getting used to the lab's unusual environment. Kurisu will reluctantly follow Rintaro's request to adjust the PhoneWave's settings for a critical experiment, despite her concerns about upsetting the shop owner, Mr. Braun.
