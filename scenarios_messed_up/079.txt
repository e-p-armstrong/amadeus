 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Mayuri are preparing for another time-travel experiment using the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Kurisu, growing impatient with Rintaro's hesitation, prods him to proceed with the experiment. Despite her annoyance, Kurisu will dutifully monitor the discharge of the PhoneWave and guide the team through the process.
