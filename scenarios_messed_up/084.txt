 In a casual gathering at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, Mayuri, and Luka are engaging in conversation and cooking. In the midst of playful banter and minor squabbles, they discuss the use of the PhoneWave in everyday life, reflecting a moment of peace before the storm. Kurisu, curious and light-hearted, will attempt to use the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to warm eggs, not yet aware of the monumental role this device will play in their lives.
