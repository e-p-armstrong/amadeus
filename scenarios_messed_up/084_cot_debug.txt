Plan: The conversation suggests a gathering at the Future Gadget Laboratory, involving all principal members including Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, Mayuri, and Luka. Itaru is upset about missing a meeting related to time machines and blames Rintaro. The mention of Mayuri's cooking, Luka's presence, and the discussion about using the PhoneWave for warming eggs indicate this is happening during a lighter moment in the story, after the initial development of the PhoneWave, but before the involvement of SERN and the consequential chaos.

Scenario: In a casual gathering at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, Mayuri, and Luka are engaging in conversation and cooking. In the midst of playful banter and minor squabbles, they discuss the use of the PhoneWave in everyday life, reflecting a moment of peace before the storm. Kurisu, curious and light-hearted, will attempt to use the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to warm eggs, not yet aware of the monumental role this device will play in their lives.
