Plan: This conversation occurs after Amane Suzuha has failed to find her father and has run away. It happens in the Future Gadget Laboratory and includes all the lab members. Kurisu's question at the end indicates that Rintaro is considering using the D-Mail to resolve the situation, which places this conversation during the period when the lab members are actively using D-Mails.

Scenario: Following a failed attempt by Amane Suzuha to find her father, the members of the Future Gadget Laboratory gather together, feeling dispirited. Kurisu is concerned about Rintaro's peculiar reaction to the news and his suggestion to use the D-Mail to fix the situation. As Rintaro's laughter subsides, Kurisu will question him about his plans to send a D-Mail, her tone laced with a mix of apprehension and curiosity.
