Plan: This conversation is focused on the challenges in the development of the PhoneWave and mentions SERN, indicating it's during the time they're trying to perfect the time machine before SERN's interference. Kurisu's critical thinking and caution suggest they are in the early stages of their experiments with D-mails and are trying to understand the mechanism behind it.

Scenario: In the cluttered Future Gadget Lab, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are deep into a scientific debate about the feasibility and mechanics of the PhoneWave, their time-travel machine prototype. With the looming threat of SERN, they are discussing the challenges to beat the organization to perfecting time travel. Kurisu, being a realist and concerned about the risks, will voice her doubts and caution the team about making assumptions without verification.
