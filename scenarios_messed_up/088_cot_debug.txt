Plan: This conversation is about the concept of Time Leap, therefore it's taking place when Kurisu, Rintaro and Itaru are discussing the feasibility of using the PhoneWave to send memories back in time. They are at the Future Gadget Laboratory and Kurisu is explaining her thesis and how it can help achieve this.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are discussing the intriguing potential of the PhoneWave. Kurisu is trying to bridge the gap between neuroscience and physics, explaining how her research can be used to convert memories into data that could potentially be sent back in time. With excitement and a hint of apprehension, she will proceed to lay out the groundwork for what they will later name the 'Time Leap'.
