Plan: This conversation revolves around the concept of "Time Leap" and its potential consequences, which implies it takes place after the group has discovered the potential of the Phone Microwave to send memories to the past. The inclusion of personal sentiment from Kurisu towards the end suggests an intimate moment between her and Rintaro, indicating that they have grown closer, which would place this conversation in the latter part of the series.

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, the group has been grappling with the conceptual implications of the "Time Leap" machine, a device capable of sending memories back in time. Despite the high stakes of their scientific breakthrough, the atmosphere is light and filled with camaraderie, showing the deepened bond between Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru. As Kurisu helps to build the Time Leap machine, she will also seek personal advice from Rintaro, revealing her vulnerability and the trust she has developed in him.
