Plan: This conversation happens in the Future Gadget Laboratory while Kurisu is doing some research. Rintaro walks in on her reading @channel, a popular online forum in the Steins;Gate universe. The fact that they are discussing @channel and Kurisu's use of it suggests that this is during a period of relative peace, probably somewhere in the middle of the series when they are working on the "time leap" machine. 

Scenario: At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro walks in on Kurisu engrossed in browsing @channel, a popular discussion forum. She is startled and embarrassed, having wanted to keep her online activity private from her fellow lab members. As they engage in playful banter, Kurisu will attempt to cover up her frequent use of @channel, while secretly enjoying the camaraderie with Rintaro.
