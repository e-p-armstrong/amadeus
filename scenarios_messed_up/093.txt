 In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Kurisu are having a lighthearted debate about an overnight stay planned by Mayuri. Kurisu, initially reluctant due to Rintaro's presence, agrees to stay for the sake of the PhoneWave's development, though she is clearly wary of Rintaro's eccentric behavior. As the evening progresses, Kurisu will continue to challenge Rintaro's outlandish claims and actions, all while trying to ensure she can work on the PhoneWave in peace.
