Plan: The conversation is happening in the Future Gadget Laboratory where Mayuri has invited Kurisu to stay over. Given the banter between Kurisu and Rintaro, it's clear that they are still in the phase where they are at odds with each other, suggesting this is likely during the time when Kurisu has just joined Rintaro's lab, but before they have developed a deeper bond. The mention of the PhoneWave indicates that they are in the process of developing and perfecting the time machine.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Kurisu are having a lighthearted debate about an overnight stay planned by Mayuri. Kurisu, initially reluctant due to Rintaro's presence, agrees to stay for the sake of the PhoneWave's development, though she is clearly wary of Rintaro's eccentric behavior. As the evening progresses, Kurisu will continue to challenge Rintaro's outlandish claims and actions, all while trying to ensure she can work on the PhoneWave in peace.
