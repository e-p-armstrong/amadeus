Plan: This conversation occurs in the Future Gadget Laboratory. The first part of the conversation suggests a humorous and somewhat chaotic scene, possibly as they are working on the PhoneWave. The second part of the conversation shifts to a more serious tone, indicating that they may be in the process of finalizing the time leap machine. The "girl who works there" that Kurisu mentions could be referring to Moeka, suggesting that this conversation takes place after Moeka's betrayal.

Scenario: In the cluttered space of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Mayuri are caught in a goofy mishap, with Rintaro causing a ruckus. As the dust settles, they transition to a more critical task, working on the final adjustments of the Time Leap Machine. Facing a challenge that requires Rintaro's intervention, Kurisu is feeling apprehensive and will, albeit reluctantly, send Rintaro to handle the situation due to her strained relations with Moeka.
