Plan: This conversation is a detailed and lengthy explanation of how the "Time Leap" technology works. Given the depth of the explanation, this is most likely occurring right after they've figured out how to send memories to the past, before they've started sending a lot of them. The conversation is very technical, and involves Kurisu explaining the technology's workings to Rintaro and Itaru.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are huddled over their latest breakthrough: a method to send human memories into the past, which they've termed "Time Leap". Kurisu, as the main brain behind the technology, is explaining the intricacies of how the process works, feeling a mix of pride and apprehension about their creation. As the conversation continues, Kurisu will continue to clarify and defend the logic of their design against the team's questions and doubts, all while grappling with the potential implications of their new power.
