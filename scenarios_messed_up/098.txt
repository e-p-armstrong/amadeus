 The Future Gadget Laboratory is buzzing with intense discussion as Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri grapple with the implications of their latest discovery: the Time Leap Machine, which can send memories to the past. Kurisu is feeling conflicted and a bit anxious, as she understands the potential risks of their invention and debates whether to turn it over to authorities. In the upcoming conversation, she will try to explain the mechanics of the Time Leap Machine and assuage the group's fears about fractalized data and memory loss.
