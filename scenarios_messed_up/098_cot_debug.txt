Plan: This conversation takes place after the group has discovered the ability to send memories to the past, effectively allowing the consciousness of the sender to time travel. They are discussing the implications and risks of this process, trying to decide who will take the leap. Given the complexity of the discussion and the involvement of all major characters, this conversation likely occurs in the middle of the plot, before any major crises but after significant development of the time travel concept.

Scenario: The Future Gadget Laboratory is buzzing with intense discussion as Kurisu, Rintaro, Itaru, and Mayuri grapple with the implications of their latest discovery: the Time Leap Machine, which can send memories to the past. Kurisu is feeling conflicted and a bit anxious, as she understands the potential risks of their invention and debates whether to turn it over to authorities. In the upcoming conversation, she will try to explain the mechanics of the Time Leap Machine and assuage the group's fears about fractalized data and memory loss.
