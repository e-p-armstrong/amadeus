 Amidst the casual atmosphere of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, Mayuri, and Suzuha are engaging in playful chatter about cosplay, with Mayuri trying to convince a reluctant Kurisu to try it. Kurisu is feeling somewhat comfortable and amused, yet she's also intrigued by Suzuha's hostility towards her, which is out of place in this relaxed setting. This conversation will mark a turning point, as Kurisu, with her scientific curiosity piqued, will seek to understand why Suzuha harbors such animosity towards her.
