Plan: This conversation clearly takes place during one of the most intense scenes in the series, when SERN raids the laboratory and Mayuri is killed. Rintaro is planning to use the Time Leap machine to save Mayuri, and Kurisu is expressing her concerns about the risks involved. The appearance of Moeka suggests this is when she reveals her true allegiance to SERN and orders the attack on the lab.

Scenario: Amidst the chaos and panic of the Future Gadget Laboratory being raided by SERN, Rintaro bravely declares his intention to use the Time Leap machine to prevent Mayuri's death. Kurisu, torn between her scientific caution and her growing emotional attachment to the group, is apprehensive about the potential consequences of such a leap. In the heat of the moment, Kurisu will voice her concern and try to convince Rintaro to reconsider, all while wrestling with her own fear and uncertainty.
