Plan: This conversation is clearly tense and filled with threat, indicating a major shift in the story's atmosphere. Given the characters involved (Kurisu and Moeka) and the mention of men stationed throughout Akihabara, it is likely taking place during the SERN raid on the Future Gadget Laboratory.

Scenario: The Future Gadget Laboratory is under sudden and hostile siege by SERN operatives led by Moeka. Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru are cornered, the fear and tension palpable in the air. With a confused and frightened expression, Kurisu will question Moeka about their motives, desperately seeking a way to deescalate the situation.
