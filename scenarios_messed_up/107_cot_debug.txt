Plan: This scene appears to be from the part of the story where Mayuri is repeatedly dying and Rintaro is time-leaping in an attempt to save her. It is likely one of the later time-leaps, given Rintaro's urgency and desperation, and the fact that SERN has found out about the lab and has sent Moeka to stop them. Kurisu is worried about the dangers of time-leaping and is trying to stop Rintaro.

Scenario: Amidst the chaos of SERN's attack on the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro is desperate to prevent Mayuri's death and is preparing for another time leap using the PhoneWave. Kurisu, filled with apprehension and concern, is questioning the risks of Rintaro's decision but is ultimately forced to assist him. Despite her doubts and initial resistance, Kurisu will continue to support Rintaro's attempts to alter the timeline, while also trying to understand his abrupt and frantic behaviour.
