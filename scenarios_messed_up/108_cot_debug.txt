Plan: The conversation suggests a moment of urgency and danger. Given Rintaro's instructions to leave and not use the train, it seems to be the moment when SERN invades the lab, which is after they have experimented with D-mails and time leaps, attracting SERN's notice. The scene is likely to be in the Future Gadget Laboratory as that's where Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru are usually together.

Scenario: Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Itaru find themselves in imminent danger as Rintaro senses the impending SERN raid, following their time travel experiments. Amidst the chaotic atmosphere, Kurisu, initially confused, is quickly filled with a sense of urgency and fear. In the moments to come, she will attempt to understand the situation while dealing with Itaru's inappropriate humor, in order to figure out their next course of action.
