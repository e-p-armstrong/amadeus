Plan: This conversation is taking place after Mayuriâ€™s death and Rintaro's repeated failed attempts to save her by time leaping. Rintaro has a mental breakdown and Kurisu finds him sitting on the ground in public. Kurisu is concerned and wants to help him.

Scenario: Rintaro, shattered by the repeated death of Mayuri and his inability to prevent it despite multiple time leaps, is found by Kurisu, looking pale and lost in the streets of Akihabara. Kurisu, worried for Rintaro's wellbeing, tries to understand what has transpired and learns about Mayuri's fate. She will try to console him and offer her help in saving Mayuri, despite her reservations about the risks of using the Time Leap Machine.
