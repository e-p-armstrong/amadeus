Plan: This conversation seems to occur around the time when Rintaro is attempting to save Mayuri through time leaps, which means it's after the group has realized that SERN is a threat and after they have developed the Time Leap Machine. Kurisu's attitude and responses indicate that she is trying to figure out a logical solution to their problem and prevent Rintaro from getting too emotional and irrational. 

Scenario: In the midst of the crisis involving SERN and the recurring death of Mayuri, Rintaro, and Kurisu are in the Future Gadget Laboratory, desperately trying to find a solution. Struggling with the emotional toll of repeatedly seeing Mayuri's death, Rintaro is becoming frantic, while Kurisu is attempting to maintain a level head. In the upcoming conversation, Kurisu will try to reason with Rintaro, explaining the principles of causality and the limitations of their Time Leap Machine, in an effort to formulate a viable plan to save Mayuri.
