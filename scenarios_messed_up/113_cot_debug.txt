Plan: This conversation is happening after the lab members have developed the Time Leap Machine but are facing limitations with it, namely that they can only leap back in time up to a certain point. Rintaro is desperate to save Mayuri from her impending death at the hands of SERN. Kurisu is explaining the limitations of the Time Leap Machine to him.

Scenario: Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are grappling with the limitations of the Time Leap Machine they've developed, specifically its inability to take them back past a certain point in time. The stakes are high as they desperately need to prevent SERN from killing Mayuri, a scenario that's set to occur in just a few short hours. Kurisu, while sympathetic to Rintaro's desperation, is trying to explain the current technical limitations and the potential dangers of seeking outside help, even as she considers potential improvements for the future.
