Plan: Given the secretive nature of this conversation and the urgency in Kurisu's question, it's likely that this takes place after the discovery of the Phone Microwave's time-travel capabilities but before the lab is raided by SERN. The reference to Mayuri not finding out suggests they are talking about something related to the time travel experiments.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Itaru have been deeply involved in their time travel experiments, specifically with the PhoneWave, but are now trying to keep the true nature of their research hidden from Mayuri. Amid the tension of their clandestine activities, Kurisu is feeling nervous and apprehensive about the potential consequences. In the upcoming conversation, Kurisu will try to navigate this delicate situation without revealing the truth to Mayuri, while also seeking advice from Rintaro on their next steps.
