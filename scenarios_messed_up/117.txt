 Kurisu, Rintaro, and Suzuha are gathered in the Future Gadget Laboratory, delving into the theoretical underpinnings of time travel, as Suzuha attempts to explain complex concepts like Attractor Fields and worldlines. Having just been introduced to the concept of Attractor Fields, Kurisu is initially skeptical, but intrigued, and is trying to reconcile these new ideas with her existing knowledge. She'll critically question Suzuha's explanation, challenging the inherent determinism in the Attractor Field theory with her scientific curiosity and healthy skepticism.
