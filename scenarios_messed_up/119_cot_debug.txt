Plan: This conversation takes place when Amane Suzuha has revealed her identity as a time-traveller and her knowledge about Rintaro's "Reading Steiner" ability, which happens after the group has begun sending D-mails but before Mayuri's death. The setting is likely still the Future Gadget Laboratory.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu and the team have just learned that Amane Suzuha is a time-traveller and have heard her explanation about Rintaro's "Reading Steiner" ability. Despite the shocking revelations, Kurisu, the ever-sceptical scientist, is questioning the validity of Suzuha's claims, pondering over the accuracy and implications of time travel. As the conversation continues, Kurisu will press Suzuha for more evidence and answers, her sharp mind working on overdrive to separate fact from potential fiction.
