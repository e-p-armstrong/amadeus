Plan: This conversation suggests that Suzuha's time machine has broken down and they are considering using the Time Leap Machine to correct this. This is likely happening after they have mastered the Time Leap Machine and have been using it for various purposes. This must be during the period when they are trying to evade SERN, given the level of desperation to use the Time Leap Machine.

Scenario: In the face of the malfunctioning time machine belonging to Suzuha, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Suzuha are gathered in the Future Gadget Laboratory, brainstorming ways to fix it. Having gained considerable knowledge and experience with time travel, Kurisu is contemplating the potential of using the Time Leap Machine to rectify the situation. Despite the risks, Kurisu will propose using the Time Leap Machine to go back to a time before the time machine's malfunction.
