Plan: This conversation takes place during the crisis period when Mayuri is repeatedly dying, and Rintaro is time leaping to save her. Given the presence of Suzuha and the discussion about the time machine, this is likely after Suzuha has revealed herself as John Titor and the daughter of Itaru. Rintaro's statement about leaping back to the 11th also situates this conversation after they've developed the Time Leap technology.

Scenario: In the midst of a tense atmosphere in the Future Gadget Lab, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Suzuha are discussing their plan to repair the time machine, following Suzuha's revelation of her true identity as John Titor, Itaru's daughter from the future. Rintaro, desperate to save Mayuri from her repeated deaths, announces his plan to time leap again. Kurisu, though worried about the potential consequences of meddling with time, will question the efficacy of Rintaro's plan and brainstorm alternatives.
