 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, after the discovery of the "Time Leap" and the ability to send memories into the past, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Suzuha are discussing the details of their recent time travel exploits. Kurisu, still skeptical but increasingly accepting of the time travel phenomena, is working on the Time Leap Machine, although she feels confliced about it. She is about to question Rintaro further about his previous time leaps, while also attempting to maintain her scientific skepticism despite the mounting evidence.
