Plan: This conversation is happening after the development of the Time Leap Machine, but before Mayuri's repeated deaths. Kurisu is discussing the mechanics of time leaping and the nature of consciousness, and her tone indicates that she is confused and apprehensive about their discovery.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Kurisu, Rintaro, and Suzuha are discussing the newly completed Time Leap Machine. The atmosphere is charged with both excitement and uncertainty as they grapple with the implications of their invention. Kurisu, feeling both proud and apprehensive, will dive deeper into the discussion, seeking to understand the mysteries of consciousness, the Reading Steiner, and the potential effects of their time manipulation experiments.
