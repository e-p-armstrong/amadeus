Plan: The conversation indicates a high-tension situation where Rintaro is angry at Itaru, and Kurisu is trying to mediate. This could be following a failed experiment or a setback in their research. The most probable period is during the series of time leaps Rintaro takes to try and save Mayuri, with each failure increasing his frustration. 

Scenario: After another unsuccessful attempt to save Mayuri using the time leap machine, tension is high in the Future Gadget Laboratory. Rintaro, frustrated and desperate, is on the verge of lashing out at Itaru, while Kurisu, maintaining her composure, steps in to defuse the situation. Keeping her usual cool demeanor, Kurisu will attempt to soothe Rintaro's anger and convince him to stay rational, despite the emotional strain they are all under.
