 The Future Gadget Laboratory team, including Rintaro, Kurisu, Itaru, Mayuri, and Suzuha, has taken a break from their usual research to go on a trip in search of a mysterious pin. Despite the light-hearted atmosphere, Kurisu is concerned about Rintaro's health and is openly voicing her worry. As the day progresses, Kurisu, despite her exhaustion, will continue to prioritize their research, expressing her preference for working on the time leap machine over leisurely activities.
