 After a day spent at the bustling ComiMa, Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru are taking in the sight of the now-empty venue. They've ventured out from their usual haunt, the Future Gadget Laboratory, for this event, and while Kurisu is still somewhat bemused by their otaku tendencies, she's become a part of their adventures. With the day winding down, Kurisu is dreading the long bike ride back to the lab, and will likely engage in more friendly banter and shared experiences with Mayuri and Itaru on their way back.
