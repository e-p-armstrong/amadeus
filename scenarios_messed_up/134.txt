 The group of friends, including Kurisu, Suzuha, Mayuri, and Itaru, are out in the streets of Akihabara when they narrowly escape a reckless truck driver. Though shaken, they find relief in the fact that no one is hurt and proceed to discuss the incident. Sensibly, Kurisu will remind the others to keep calm, pointing out that while the situation was dangerous, no harm was done and they should focus on moving forward.
