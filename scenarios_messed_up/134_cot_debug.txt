Plan: This conversation indicates that the group has just narrowly avoided being hit by a truck. Given the characters involved (Kurisu, Suzuha, Mayuri, and Itaru), this is likely taking place outside the Future Gadget Laboratory or somewhere in Akihabara. The casual talk suggests a non-crisis moment, possibly in the middle of the story.

Scenario: The group of friends, including Kurisu, Suzuha, Mayuri, and Itaru, are out in the streets of Akihabara when they narrowly escape a reckless truck driver. Though shaken, they find relief in the fact that no one is hurt and proceed to discuss the incident. Sensibly, Kurisu will remind the others to keep calm, pointing out that while the situation was dangerous, no harm was done and they should focus on moving forward.
