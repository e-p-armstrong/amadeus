 Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru find themselves in the expansive, bustling city of Tokyo, specifically at the Tokyo Big Sight, known for hosting the ComiMa event. They are currently on a break from their lab work, which gave them the opportunity to travel away from their usual locale. Feeling the strain of the long bike trip and dreading the journey back, Kurisu will reluctantly agree to taking a break and grabbing a meal with Itaru and Mayuri before they return to the Future Gadget Laboratory.
