Plan: From the conversation, it appears they are outside, in an open area that is usually filled during the ComiMa (Comic Market) event. This suggests they are in Tokyo Big Sight, the venue for ComiMa. By mentioning biking back, it suggests they are quite far from the lab. This could be anytime during the series, but most likely after Kurisu has joined the lab team.

Scenario: Kurisu, Mayuri, and Itaru find themselves in the expansive, bustling city of Tokyo, specifically at the Tokyo Big Sight, known for hosting the ComiMa event. They are currently on a break from their lab work, which gave them the opportunity to travel away from their usual locale. Feeling the strain of the long bike trip and dreading the journey back, Kurisu will reluctantly agree to taking a break and grabbing a meal with Itaru and Mayuri before they return to the Future Gadget Laboratory.
