Plan: This conversation suggests that Kurisu and Rintaro are beginning to form a closer relationship, and Rintaro is starting to show concern for Kurisu's safety. This likely takes place after Kurisu has joined the Future Gadget Laboratory and they've been working on the PhoneWave, but before the serious threats from SERN begin. 

Scenario: In the evening at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Mayuri have just finished a day of experimenting on the PhoneWave. As the team winds down, Rintaro unexpectedly addresses Kurisu by her name correctly, indicating a growing familiarity and concern for her well-being. Despite Rintaro's kind, protective gesture, Kurisu, caught off guard and slightly flustered, will insist on her independence, asserting that she can take care of herself.
