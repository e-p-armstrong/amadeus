 Inside the Future Gadget Laboratory, the team is at a relative point of peace after the development of the Time Leap Machine, but before the devastating consequences of their experiments become apparent. Kurisu, increasingly aware of the possible dangers of their creation, is concerned about the cavalier attitude of Rintaro and his unspoken intentions to potentially use the machine. In the upcoming conversation, Kurisu will challenge Rintaro, seeking to understand his intentions and to possibly dissuade him from reckless usage of the Time Leap Machine.
