Plan: This conversation takes place at the Yanabayashi Shrine. Given the mention of mapping Luka's brain patterns and the discussion of the differences between male and female brains, this is likely when Rintaro has to undo Luka's D-mail and return him to being a male. 

Scenario: Rintaro and Kurisu have traveled to Yanabayashi Shrine to face Luka with an uncomfortable truth: they need to undo the D-mail that made him a girl. Rintaro, struggling with how to approach this sensitive topic, enlists Kurisu's scientific expertise to explain the neurological differences between male and female brains. Feeling somewhat sympathetic but primarily scientific curiosity, Kurisu will attempt to persuade Luka to agree to a brain mapping experiment, hoping to provide a tangible, scientific basis for the need to revert his gender.
