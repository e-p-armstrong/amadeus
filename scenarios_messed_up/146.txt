 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu are discussing Luka's revealed wish to be a girl, a wish that can be granted by the use of a D-mail. Kurisu, pragmatic and empathetic, understands Luka's desire and supports it, despite Rintaro's hesitation due to his preconceived notions of Luka's gender. In the ensuing conversation, Kurisu will attempt to convince Rintaro to let go of his biases and help Luka, using a blend of logic and sarcasm.
