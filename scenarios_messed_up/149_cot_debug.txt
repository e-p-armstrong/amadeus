Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place in the presence of Rintaro, Kurisu, and Faris. Based on the dialogue, it's likely that it's happening at the MayQueen NyanNyan café where Faris works, in the middle of the series after Kurisu has joined the lab. 

Scenario: At the MayQueen NyanNyan café, Rintaro, Kurisu, and Faris find themselves in a lively conversation. Kurisu is observing Rintaro's exchanges with Faris, her curiosity piqued about his relationships with other women. In the upcoming conversation, Kurisu will use her sharp wit to probe Rintaro about his romantic inclinations.
