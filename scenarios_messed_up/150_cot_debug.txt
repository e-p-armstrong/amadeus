Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place after Kurisu has joined the lab and they have discovered the Phone Microwave's ability to send D-mails. The mention of ComiMa indicates that this conversation happens at a specific point in the series when Rintaro was supposed to accompany Mayuri to a comic market event but was caught up with his experiments. 

Scenario: In the bustling Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro is engrossed in his experiments with the PhoneWave, while Kurisu is acting as a mediator between him and Mayuri, who is upset because Rintaro broke his promise to go to ComiMa. Despite being annoyed at Rintaro's disregard for Mayuri's feelings, Kurisu is also intrigued by his request to use the PhoneWave and is about to probe further into his intentions.
