Kurisu is trying to comfort him and get him to eat, indicating she cares for him and is worried about his well-being. 

Scenario: In the aftermath of numerous failed attempts to save Mayuri from her destined death, Rintaro is in the depths of despair, refusing to eat and shutting himself away in the Future Gadget Laboratory.

In this emotionally charged conversation, Kurisu will try to convince Rintaro to accept what has happened and to take responsibility for the lives he did manage to save.
