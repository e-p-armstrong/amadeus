 At the Future Gadget Laboratory, Mayuri is excitedly discussing her plans to attend a multi-day cosplay event. Kurisu, while interested in Mayuri's stories, is hesitant about attending such a crowded event, and attempts to redirect the invitation to Rintaro, who, despite claiming to have other business, insists on having a private conversation with Kurisu. Kurisu, caught off guard but intrigued, will attempt to understand Rintaro's sudden seriousness amidst the lighthearted conversation.
