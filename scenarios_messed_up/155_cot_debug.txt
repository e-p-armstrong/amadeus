Plan: This conversation is during a critical moment when Rintaro and Kurisu are attempting to send a D-Mail to Moeka, to undo the effects of her original D-Mail and revert the timeline. They are separated, with Kurisu at the lab and Rintaro at Moeka's place, and are communicating over the phone. It seems to be a tense and high-stakes situation.

Scenario: Rintaro and Kurisu are in the midst of trying to undo the effects of a D-mail sent by Moeka, with Rintaro at Moeka's apartment and Kurisu working from the Future Gadget Laboratory. The situation is tense, as Rintaro is under pressure and Kurisu is trying to manage the situation from the lab. As the attempts to send the cancellation D-mail keep failing, Kurisu will need to keep her cool and think of alternative strategies to help Rintaro succeed.
