Plan: This conversation is happening after they've discovered that the Rounders' manager is FB and right before they are about to send another D-Mail to alter the past. Given the mention of a gunshot and Nae, this is likely after Moeka's death and Nae's revenge. Kurisu is urging Rintaro to focus on saving Mayuri rather than taking revenge on SERN. 

Scenario: The scene is set in the tense aftermath of discovering the identity of FB and the tragic death of Moeka at the hands of Nae. Kurisu, Rintaro, and the team are in a race against time to send a critical D-Mail to prevent Mayuri's death. Kurisu, while shaken by the recent violence, is trying to refocus Rintaro's attention on their mission to save Mayuri, and will press him to take immediate action.
