Plan: This conversation suggests a tense situation, likely after an event involving Moeka (otherwise known as Kiryu). Given that Kurisu suggests sending a D-Mail, it's probably taking place in the Future Gadget Laboratory. This could be after Moeka's attack on the lab.

Scenario: In the aftermath of Moeka's unexpected attack on the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro is panicking, unsure of how to handle the situation. Kurisu, despite being shaken, is trying to maintain her composure in order to figure out the best course of action. With a sense of urgency, Kurisu will suggest sending a D-Mail, hoping to prevent this disastrous event from ever occurring.
