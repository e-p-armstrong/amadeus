Plan: This conversation seems to be happening during one of the darker points of the series - after the first time Mayuri dies, and when Rintaro is desperately trying to save her by undoing the D-mails. The mention of Nae, and her threatening to kill Rintaro, suggests this is after Moeka's D-mail is undone. Kurisu's mention of time leaping also indicates this. 

Scenario: In the heart of the series' conflict, Rintaro and Kurisu are battling against time and fate, attempting to undo the consequences of their D-mails to save Mayuri. They've just undone Moeka's D-mail, and faced a threat from Nae, which left them both shaken. A determined Kurisu, feeling an urgent need to fix things, will suggest another time leap to Rintaro, trying to keep him focused on the task at hand.
