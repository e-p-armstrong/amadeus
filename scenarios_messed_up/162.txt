They are preparing to send a D-Mail to undo the changes caused by a previous D-Mail, with Rintaro nursing an injury that will disappear once the worldline shifts. Kurisu, worried and frantic, will try to keep the situation under control by assisting Rintaro and discussing the peculiar behaviour of Tennouji.
