Plan: Given the characters involved and the mention of Moeka's apartment, this conversation likely takes place after Moeka's D-mail is undone and Rintaro is asking the lab members about their memories of her. Given that Daru is at ComiMa, this is likely during one of the quiet periods between the undoing of D-mails and the subsequent timeline changes.

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro is trying to piece together the altered memories of his lab members in the aftermath of undoing Moeka's D-mail. Kurisu, feeling somewhat confused and curious, denies ever visiting Moeka's apartment. Moving forward, Kurisu will attempt to help Rintaro understand the timeline changes, even while she herself is trying to reconcile her own, altered memories.
