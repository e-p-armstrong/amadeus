Plan: In this conversation, the group is discussing the IBN 5100, which is instrumental in decoding SERN's encrypted files. This is likely taking place in the Future Gadget Laboratory after they have acquired the IBN 5100, but before SERN becomes a significant threat. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro, Itaru, and Kurisu are discussing how to use the IBN 5100 to further their time travel research. Having been involved in a flurry of activities, including preparing for ComiMa, Itaru is exhausted, yet remains committed to the cause. Although irritated by their banter, Kurisu is focused and will attempt to steer their attention back to the task at hand.
