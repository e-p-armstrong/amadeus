Plan: The conversation suggests a tense moment where Rintaro is planning to infiltrate SERN. Given Rintaro's mention of escaping the Alpha worldline and saving Mayuri, this places the scene after the point when SERN has started hunting them and after Mayuri's repeated deaths. This is before they figure out how to undo the D-mails.

Scenario: In a tense meeting at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro is urging the team to prepare for a risky operation: hacking into SERN. Having witnessed Mayuri's repeated deaths in alternate timelines, Rintaro is desperate to change their fate. Kurisu, while concerned about the legality and safety of their actions, is about to engage in a heated debate about their course of action with Rintaro.
