Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place after the lab has been raided by SERN and Mayuri has repeatedly died in multiple timelines. It is likely set in a private and quiet place where Rintaro and Kurisu can talk seriously. 

Scenario: Rintaro, burdened by the cycle of Mayuri's death, has secluded himself, prompting Kurisu to seek him out in concern. He is wrestling with the painful decision of choosing between Kurisu's life and Mayuri's, as the alteration of the timeline to save Mayuri would result in Kurisu's death. In this emotionally charged conversation, Kurisu will try to understand Rintaro's predicament, and will attempt to challenge the established time travel theories in hopes of finding another solution.
