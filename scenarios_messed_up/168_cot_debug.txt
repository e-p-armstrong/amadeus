Plan: This conversation is likely toward the end of the story when Rintaro and Kurisu are dealing with the concept of worldlines and the possibility of Kurisu's death if they revert to the original timeline. This suggests that they're deep in their understanding of time travel and dealing with the consequences, specifically the dilemma of saving Mayuri or Kurisu.

Scenario: Kurisu and Rintaro are in the midst of a heated discussion about the nature of worldlines and parallel universes within the Future Gadget Laboratory, with the threat of SERN looming over them. With the weight of her potential death hanging in the balance, Kurisu is attempting to comfort Rintaro, despite her own fears. In the face of their dire situation, she will use her scientific knowledge to argue her perspective, trying to ease his worry over choosing between saving her or Mayuri.
