Plan: The conversation suggests a tense situation. Kurisu is calling Rintaro a wimp, implying he's not acting like his usual self. The mention of Mayuri, and the possibility of death, suggests this happens after the lab was raided by SERN and Mayuri's life is in constant danger. This is likely a timeline where Rintaro is time leaping to save Mayuri, but failing each time.

Scenario: In the midst of the timelines where Rintaro is desperately time leaping to save Mayuri from SERN's attacks, there's a heavy atmosphere in the Future Gadget Laboratory. Rintaro is overwhelmed by fear and guilt, causing Kurisu to witness a side of him that is far from his 'mad scientist' persona. Kurisu, though worried herself, is trying to encourage Rintaro to confront his fear and talk to Mayuri about his feelings, in an attempt to restore his confidence and resolve.
