 Caught in a sudden downpour, Rintaro and Kurisu have taken refuge in a building, probably the Future Gadget Laboratory. Their conversation, filled with playful banter and subtle hints of growing affection, takes a more personal turn as Kurisu offers to mend a tear in Rintaro's coat. Kurisu, though initially defensive, will continue to interact with Rintaro in a manner that suggests a deeper interest, thereby furthering their emotional connection.
