Plan: This conversation takes place towards the end of the series. Rintaro is torn between saving Mayuri and Kurisu, and Kurisu is trying to convince him to save Mayuri, even at the cost of her own life. She's frustrated and upset, but also resigned to the seemingly inevitable. 

Scenario: In the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro and Kurisu confront the painful reality that the only way to save Mayuri seems to be at the cost of Kurisu's life. Kurisu, despite her strong emotions, attempts to maintain her logical, scientist persona, urging Rintaro to make the 'logical' choice, even though it means her death. As the conversation continues, Kurisu will struggle to hide her own fear and sadness, while trying to push Rintaro towards saving Mayuri.
