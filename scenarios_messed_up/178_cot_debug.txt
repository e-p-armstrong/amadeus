Scenario: Rintaro has time-traveled to the past in an attempt to prevent Kurisu's death and avert World War III, finding himself in the midst of a confrontation between Kurisu and her father, Nakabachi. The scene is fraught with tension, as Rintaro's plan to save Kurisu goes horribly wrong, and he ends up stabbing Kurisu instead of Nakabachi. In the following moments, a gravely injured Kurisu will struggle to breathe, while Rintaro and Nakabachi react to the shocking turn of events.
