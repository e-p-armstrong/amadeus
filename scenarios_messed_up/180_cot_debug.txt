Plan: This conversation seems to occur at a critical moment in the story. Rintaro's statement about wanting to save Kurisu suggests that this is after he has made the decision to undo the D-mails and return to the original timeline, where Kurisu dies. This is probably taking place in the Future Gadget Laboratory, just before Rintaro is about to embark on his mission to save both Kurisu and Mayuri.

Scenario: In the tense atmosphere of the Future Gadget Laboratory, Rintaro has made the heart-wrenching decision to undo the D-mails, leading to a timeline where Kurisu meets her tragic end. Overwhelmed with a mix of confusion, fear, and surprise, Kurisu confronts Rintaro as he descends from the lab's second floor, unaware of the grave determination behind his words. As Rintaro confesses his intention to her, Kurisu will be taken aback and question him, trying to grasp the gravity of his declaration.
