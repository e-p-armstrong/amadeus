Plan: This conversation is taking place towards the end of the storyline, when Rintaro is trying to save Kurisu from her father, Dr. Nakabachi, who is the one who originally kills her. In this timeline, Kurisu is aware that her father wants to kill Rintaro. 

Scenario: In a desperate attempt to change the timeline and save both Mayuri and Kurisu, Rintaro confronts Dr. Nakabachi at a lecture hall, deliberately drawing his murderous intent away from Kurisu. Kurisu, fearful yet determined, is torn between protecting Rintaro and trying to reason with her father. As tensions escalate, Kurisu will make a desperate plea to her father to stop his attack on Rintaro.
