Plan: This conversation suggests a critical situation where someone's life is in danger. Given Rintaro's statement, it's likely that he's referring to his determination to save Kurisu from her destined death in the original timeline. This could be one of the instances where Rintaro has decided to time leap to save Kurisu, probably towards the end of the series.

Scenario: In a heart-wrenching moment, Rintaro has just been injured but is determined to change the course of events that result in Kurisu's death, as they have reached a timeline where the reality of her fatal fate has been revealed. Despite her concern for Rintaro's immediate physical condition, Kurisu is confused and unsure of what he's implying. As panic and confusion fill the air, Kurisu will attempt to get help, while Rintaro prepares for yet another desperate leap through time to save her.
