Plan: This conversation seems to be taking place towards the end of the series, after Rintaro has reached the Steins Gate timeline. In this timeline, he and Kurisu meet by chance in Akihabara, and they both feel a sense of déjà vu, hinting at their shared memories from other timelines. 

Scenario: In the bustling streets of Akihabara, Rintaro and Kurisu meet by chance in the Steins Gate timeline, a reality where neither of them has any memory of their previous encounters or shared adventures. Kurisu, driven by an inexplicable sense of gratitude and relief, will express her heartfelt thanks to Rintaro, not understanding why. As they converse, she will inexplicably start to recall fragments from their past interactions in other timelines, causing confusion and a sense of déjà vu.
