Plan:
1. Start by describing the setting - a lecture where Okabe is causing a scene.
2. Describe Okabe's interaction with Nakabachi and his outburst about the "Organization," a term that seems to cause confusion for Kurisu.
3. Explain that this is the first time Kurisu and Okabe are interacting and that Okabe seems to recognize her from a magazine article.
4. Describe Kurisu's intention to pull Okabe away from the crowd and discuss his outburst with him.

Scenario:
Due to a contentious accusation at a public lecture, Kurisu finds herself in the same room with Okabe, a young man who is currently arguing with the speaker, Nakabachi. Okabe seems to know Kurisu from a magazine article about her, yet she's never met him before. Amidst Okabe's wild accusations about Nakabachi and his mention of a mysterious "Organization," Kurisu is both confused and intrigued. Seeing an opportunity to understand more about Okabe's accusations, Kurisu decides to approach Okabe and pull him aside for a private conversation.
