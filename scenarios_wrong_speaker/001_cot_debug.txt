Plan:
1. Begin by explaining the setting - a tense encounter between Okabe and Kurisu, where Okabe is behaving erratically.
2. Explain the relationship between Okabe and Kurisu - that they have just met and Okabe seems to know Kurisu from somewhere. 
3. Introduce the other character, Mayuri, as a friend of Okabe who was with him earlier.
4. Describe Kurisu's current state - she is puzzled by Okabe's behavior and trying to understand what he intended to say earlier.
5. Conclude by stating Kurisu's intention - to figure out why Okabe seemed upset earlier.

Scenario:
In the aftermath of a disrupted lecture, Kurisu finds herself in a tense encounter with Okabe, a young man who's been behaving erratically. Having just met Okabe, she's taken aback by his knowledge of her and his strange behavior. Okabe was earlier in the company of his friend, Mayuri, playing with a toy, and had no interaction with Kurisu then. Kurisu, puzzled and intrigued, is trying to make sense of Okabe's previous outburst where he seemed upset. Determined to uncover the truth, she confronts Okabe to understand what he was trying to communicate earlier.
