[name]???[line]“Hey, what are you mumbling about?”[%p]
There’s no sound from the phone against my right ear. Only silence.[%p]
I am baking in the summer sun.[%p]
Sweat slowly slides down my chin and drips onto the asphalt.[%p]
[name]???[line]“Okarin? Earth to Okarin!”[%p]
A girl is standing in front of me.[%p]
She calls my name with an inquisitive tilt of her head.[%p]
We are about to infiltrate deep into enemy territory. Yet despite the imminent risk of death, there is no hint of tension on her innocent, childlike features.[%p]
I cover my phone’s mouthpiece and turn to the girl with an index finger to my lips.[%p]
[name]???[line]“You talking to someone?”[%p]
I nod and put my phone back to my ear.[%p]
Still no sound from the other side.[%p]
My contact is wise to maintain silence. The whole area could be bugged.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...No, I was just talking to someone. Everything’s fine. I’m about to infiltrate the assembly hall.”[%p]
Still no reply.[%p]
Looks like they just want my report.[%p]
It’s too dangerous to waste time talking here anyway.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, Doctor Nakabachi got the jump on us, but I’ll make sure he tells us everything.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What!? [color index="820000"]The Organization[color index="800000"] is already on the move!?”[%p]
I open my eyes wide to match my shocked tone.[%p]
The girl turns towards me in surprise.[%p]
I sigh, shaking my head as I rub my temples.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see... so that’s the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
I speak the parting words, then pocket my cellphone.[%p]
Steins Gate. Some know it as Fate; to others, it is the Will of God.[%p]
You could count on one hand the people in this world aware of its true nature.[%p]
In any case, we should begin the infiltration.[%p]
I advance towards Radi-Kan, which is just across the street from the train station.[%p]
Of course, this is enemy territory. I can’t just stride through the front door like an average person.[%p]
I bypass the elevators and escalators and head to the 8th floor by the stairwell.[%p]
But I only make it to the 7th floor before I have to stop and rest.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Who was that on the phone?”[%p]
The girl -- Shiina Mayuri -- immediately resumes our conversation. She followed me all the way here, and she isn’t even short of breath.[%p]
I, on the other hand, am gasping for air with my hands on my knees.[%p]
Who would have thought an 8-story building would be so tall?[%p]
I turn to Mayuri while wiping the sweat off my brow.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If I told you, I’d have to kill you.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, wow. Thanks, Okarin!”[%p]
Mayuri smiles happily and doesn’t pry any further.[%p]
As always, she is quick to understand my position.[%p]
We’ve known each other since we were both little.[%p]
Mayuri is 16 -- two years younger than me -- so she’s more like a little sister than a typical childhood friend.[%p]
I’ve been looking out for her as long as I can remember.[%p]
I used to hope that Mayuri might become the key to Steins Gate, but now I’ve reconsidered.[%p]
I don’t want that terrible fate for her. She should live a normal life.[%p]
That is my present wish.[%p]
We continue to the 8th floor and enter the assembly hall. In front of us stands a cheap looking stage with a podium and a sign reading “Doctor Nakabachi’s Time Machine Press Conference”.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin! Okarin!”[%p]
Mayuri insists on calling me Okarin, but it’s neither my real name nor my codename. It’s just one of those annoying nicknames people use.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How many times do I have to tell you? Don’t call me Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh? But I’ve always called you that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That was then! I have since become Hououin Kyouma, the insane mad scientist hunted by secret organizations the world over. Muhahaha!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But that’s too hard to remember.”[%p]
In any case, Hououin Kyouma is my [color index="820000"]true name[color index="800000"].[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And besides, it doesn’t even sound like Okabe Rintaro. You’re weird, ehehe!”[%p]
Cease your foolish laughter![%p]
Okabe Rintaro may be my real name, but I have rejected it, for it is stupid.[%p]
And so I also hate the derivative “Okarin.”[%p]
Come on, it sounds like that elf boy’s blue pipe thing.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So, Okarin, can I ask you something?”[%p]
In one ear and out the other.[%p]
She’s been calling me that for five years now, so maybe it’s time to give up.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What are we doing here?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait. You followed me here without knowing why?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup.”[%p]
She nods without dropping her smile.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’re here for Doctor Nakabachi’s press conference.”[%p]
We’re standing in the assembly hall on the 8th floor of Radi-Kan. It is here that the conference will be held.[%p]
Doctor Nakabachi is an inventor. He appears on TV from time to time and has a few patents under his belt, but mostly he is treated as a curiosity.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Press conference? But where are the reporters?”[%p]
Mayuri’s right.[%p]
I’ve scanned the entire hall, but there’s no one who looks like a reputable reporter or cameraman.[%p]
There are only about ten of us standing in the hall, including me.[%p]
Considering Nakabachi’s moderate media presence and the fact that he claims to have invented a time machine, I would have expected more.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Could this be the Organization working its twisted influence?”[%p]
I twist my lips into a sneer.[%p]
I thought that Nakabachi was like me, a scientist fighting to overthrow the Organization.[%p]
But this press conference suggests other motives at work. Our enemies won’t miss this chance.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’d prefer not to get wrapped up in his mess.”[%p]
Nevertheless, I’m interested in what he has to say.[%p]
That’s why I’m here, blowing an afternoon of my precious summer holiday.[%p]
Mayuri ponders my utterance for a while before finally turning her head.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You wrapped something? Is it his birthday too? Ehehe!”[%p]
I let out a sigh.[%p]
Mayuri is known to not only make bad jokes, but to laugh at them too.[%p]
She’s always been... special.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Keep your guard up, Mayuri. I suspect this won’t be a normal confer--”[%p]
I didn’t even finish my sentence![%p]
Are we under attack!? Are they trying to fry our brains with [color index="820000"]electromagnetic waves[color index="800000"]!?[%p]
Dust falls from the ceiling as the floor shakes.[%p]
We’re definitely under attack.[%p]
It’s coming from above, but we’re on the top floor.[%p]
All that’s above is the roof.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“An earthquake? Is it magnitude 2? What does magnitude mean again?”[%p]
No time to deal with Mayuri’s confusion. Something’s not right about this.[%p]
I bolt out of the conference hall and run up the stairs to the roof, ignoring the “no trespassing” signs in my way.[%p]
The door is open. Upon closer inspection, I realize that the lock has been broken.[%p]
I open the door and see a billowing cloud of black smoke.[%p]
There’s some kind of phosphorescent dust sparkling in the air.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“An explosion!?”[%p]
I can’t believe it. Was there really an explosion?[%p]
My heart is racing.[%p]
Damn, I don’t know what to do.[%p]
Should I run away?[%p]
But why an explosion? Terrorists?[%p]
No, that doesn’t fit.[%p]
I mean, how do you explain [color index="A0140000"]that[color index="800000"]!?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What the...”[%p]
A strange machine is sitting in the middle of the roof.[%p]
It’s huge, maybe three meters tall, and looks kind of like a satellite.[%p]
Did that thing cause the shaking just now?[%p]
Who put it here?[%p]
Was it Doctor Nakabachi? Is this part of his presentation?[%p]
Impossible. Even if that were the case, how the hell would he get it up here?[%p]
My head is bursting with questions.[%p]
As I search for the courage to approach the machine, a throng of reporters and building staff bursts onto the rooftop.[%p]
They look just as confused as I am.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]“Please stay back, everybody!”[%p]
And then a woman, who I assume is a staff member, appears to wave us back.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]“The press conference will proceed as scheduled!”[%p]
Is she trying to hide something?[%p]
Her response was unusually quick, almost like she’s trying to keep me away from that device.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve got a nose for conspiracies, and this stinks of a coverup. What are they hiding? What was that explosion?”[%p]
I want to know... but I shouldn’t risk getting any closer.[%p]
I turn and leave...[%p]
...but not because I’m scared or anything like that.[%p]
Staff members lead all of us back to the 8th floor.[%p]
Mayuri is nowhere to be seen. She’s not in the event hall either.[%p]
I find her on the 7th floor.[%p]
Several [color index="820000"]capsule toy[color index="800000"] machines are lined up next to a plate reading “Birthplace of the Japanese PC”.[%p]
She’s gazing upon them with a wistful look.[%p]
I breathe a sigh of relief, then take out my phone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. I’ve got a bad feeling about this. Something’s happening, and I have no idea what it is.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yeah, I know. Don’t worry. I won’t do anything to jeopardize the mission. El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
After I speak the words and hang up, I am able to wipe the sweat from my forehead.[%p]
My sweat is cold.[%p]
Half of me hopes something will happen. The other half fears the same thing.[%p]
I put away my phone and look back at Mayuri.[%p]
She’s still staring at those capsule toys.[%p]
She doesn’t seem to be worried about the explosion at all.[%p]
I can’t decide if she’s level-headed or just air-headed.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hmm?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Well... I really want an Upa.”[%p]
Just as I thought.[%p]
Mayuri points to a capsule machine. The sign on the front says ’[color index="820000"]RaiNet Kakeru[color index="800000"] 3D Character Doll Series’.[%p]
RaiNet Kakeru is a popular anime series with its own card game spinoff, RaiNet AccessBattlers. They even hold international tournaments.[%p]
“Upa” is the series’s mascot character. It resembles an elliptical egg with limbs sticking out, like some kind of deformed dog.[%p]
It’s what they call an “uglycute” character.[%p]
High school girls find these creatures adorable for some reason. Last year, an ugly frog character was the rage. Its name escapes me, though.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then go for it. I can’t guarantee you’ll get an Upa, though.”[%p]
Mayuri gives me a troubled smile.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But Mayushii’s all out of 100-yen coins.”[%p]
“Mayushii” is what Mayuri calls herself sometimes.[%p]
According to her, it’s supposed to have an ☆ at the end -- Mayushii☆.[%p]
But who really cares?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So, can I borrow 100 yen? Please?”[%p]
She holds her hands out with a look like a begging puppy.[%p]
Looks like she was planning this from the very beginning.[%p]
Well, at least she didn’t say ’gimme’.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you think it’s that easy, Mayuri? You’ll get no money from me. Instead, I’ll show you just how harsh life really is.”[%p]
I pull out a 100-yen coin, set it into the machine’s slot, and spin the lever.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ah, ahh...”[%p]
I open the capsule and take out the contents.[%p]
Mayuri leans forward eagerly to see what I got.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s an Upa! And it’s metal! A Metal Upa!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is it rare?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Super rare!”[%p]
While I examine the Metal Upa, a boy who was watching us tries his luck on the same RaiNet machine.[%p]
[name]Boy[line]“Aw, a normal Upa...”[%p]
He looks at my Metal Upa in resentment.[%p]
I turn to see Mayuri’s sparkling eyes also fixed on the Upa.[%p]
Hey, high school girl. You’re acting like a little kid.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph. I give this creature of metal to you, Mayuri.”[%p]
Honestly, I don’t want it.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really!? Are you sure, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The name’s Hououin Kyouma!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe! Thank you, Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Is she doing it on purpose?[%p]
[name]Presenter[line]“Thank you all for coming to Doctor Nakabachi’s Time Machine Press Conference.”[%p]
I hear the announcement from the floor above.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sounds like they’re starting.”[%p]
I head to the stairs.[%p]
But Mayuri doesn’t follow.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s go, Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mm... just a sec. I gotta write my name.”[%p]
She’s preoccupied with the Metal Upa. I go on ahead.[%p]
[name]Presenter[line]“Without further ado, I am pleased to introduce the inventor, Doctor Nakabachi! Please welcome him with a big round of applause!”[%p]
Doctor Nakabachi enters to sparse applause.[%p]
He walks up to the podium.[%p]
He’s already wearing a frown, for some reason. I can feel his irritation from here.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“I am Doctor Nakabachi. Thank you all for coming.”[%p]
Nakabachi takes the microphone and begins to speak, his voice brimming with confidence.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Now then, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin with my theory of time travel, the greatest scientific breakthrough of the century.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Did he really build a time machine?”[%p]
Mayuri appears after writing her name on the Metal Upa. She’s a bit late, in more ways than one. What did she think a time machine presentation would be about?[%p]
I take another look around the room.[%p]
There are about 20 people now, including us, but still no media presence to speak of.[%p]
So this is the extent of Doctor Nakabachi’s fame. No one believes that he invented a time machine.[%p]
I was interested in what he had to say, true, but my expectations were no higher than the rest of the onlookers.[%p]
And a good thing they weren’t. As he proceeds to explain his time machine design, my curiosity quickly turns to disappointment, then anger.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“DOOOOOCTOOOOOOOORRR!!”[%p]
My roar silences Nakabachi and draws the eye of every person in the room.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you take us for fools!?”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Who the hell are you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who the hell am I!? Someone who knows you for a fraud, that’s who!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You stole your theory from [color index="820000"]John Titor[color index="800000"]! And you call yourself an inventor!?”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“S-someone throw this man out!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re the one we should throw out, Doctor! Have you no shame!? You have no right to call yourself an inventor!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Shut your mouth, you little pest!”[%p]
Just then, someone grabs my arm from behind.[%p]
Quite convinced it’s an official here to throw me out, I turn around to glare him down.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Unhand me, you... huh?”[%p]
[name]???[line]“...”[%p]
It’s a girl about my age.[%p]
Her intense stare seems to challenge me. I take a step back.[%p]
Her face looks somehow familiar. Where have I seen her before?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah...”[%p]
We haven’t met, but I know her face.[%p]
It’s Makise Kurisu.[%p]
A few days ago, my friend Daru showed me a magazine article titled “Girl Genius Gives Lecture in Akihabara”.[%p]
The article was about a 17-year-old girl who had just graduated from an American university. Her thesis was even published in a major scientific journal.[%p]
Girl Genius, Makise Kurisu. I recognize the stubborn-looking girl from her photograph.[%p]
She’s even wearing the exact same scowl.[%p]
What business could such a genius have with me?[%p]
She takes a quick look around the room, then turns back to me with a stern expression.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Could you come with me for a moment?”[%p]
What’s with the attitude? She’s obviously not staff, and there’s no way that [color index="A0140000"]the[color index="800000"] Makise Kurisu would be working with someone like Doctor Nakabachi.[%p]
Which means... no![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-you’re with the Organization!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If their tendrils have gotten this far, then I’ve made a grave mistake.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Stop fooling around and come with me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
My outburst has already attracted too much attention.[%p]
Nakabachi, in particular, looks like he wants to rip my head off. It must be mortifying to be exposed as a fraud by a bright young man like myself.[%p]
Anyway, I mustn’t draw any more attention to myself. If the Organization gets wind of my presence here, it could endanger Mayuri -- to say nothing of these ignorant civilians.[%p]
I let Makise Kurisu lead me out of the assembly hall.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Try anything and people are sure to notice. What will your superiors say then?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What are you talking about?”[%p]
She glares at me. Quite fiercely at that.[%p]
Attractive though she may be, there is no innocence in her eyes.[%p]
A beautiful agent, unmatched in cruelty.[%p]
My heart beats in exhilaration from the danger.[%p]
Looks like chaos really does get my blood pumping. Heh heh heh.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I just need to ask you something.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What makes you think I’ll answer? I know how the Organization operates.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What’s with this ’Organization’ stuff?”[%p]
Instead of answering, I take out my phone and put it to my ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. I’ve been caught by an Organization agent. ...Yes, it’s Makise Kurisu. She’s a dangerous one. ...No, it’s fine. I’ll find a way to--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu suddenly snatches the phone from my hand.[%p]
What skill! I didn’t have time to react.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Huh? Your phone’s off.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Who were you talking to?”[%p]
Her eyes pierce deep into my soul. I quickly look away.[%p]
She’s good. Is she trying to attack my sense of identity in order to cause a mental break?[%p]
Recover. This isn’t enough to sway me![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-your techniques don’t work on me, but I’ll tell you anyway. That’s no ordinary phone. It’s designed to deactivate the moment it leaves my hand. Muhahaha!”[%p]
Such measures are necessary to maintain secrecy. I know things that could get me killed.[%p]
I quickly retrieve my phone and wipe the cold sweat off my forehead.[%p]
Whew, that was close.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...So you talk to yourself.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Guh!”[%p]
This is bad. Ordinary methods don’t work on Makise Kurisu, the genius girl.[%p]
On the contrary, she’s the one psyching me out![%p]
Damn. Looks like I’ll have to make a tactical retreat.[%p]
If I can just find an opening![%p]
Suddenly, Kurisu steps up to me with a serious expression.[%p]
She stares right at me, her huge eyes blazing with strength of will.[%p]
Such fire. I can’t look away.[%p]
Could someone with such pure eyes really be an Organization agent?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What were you trying to tell me earlier?”[%p]
Earlier?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you talking about?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“About fifteen minutes ago. Before the conference started.”[%p]
Nonsense. This is the first time we’ve met.[%p]
I was with Mayuri and that Upa toy fifteen minutes ago.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You were trying to tell me something, right? You looked really upset.”[%p]
Is this a trap? It does seem like one of the Organization’s dirty tricks.[%p]
But would this girl do something that underhanded?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You looked like you were going to start crying any second.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why? Have we met before?”[%p]
She seems sincere.[%p]
That makes her even more suspicious.[%p]
That’s right, don’t let her beauty fool you![%p]
She’s a cold, calculating secret agent.[%p]
If I show the slightest vulnerability, I’m done for![%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And how do you know my name?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“My knowledge has no limits.”[%p]
I am a mad scientist, after all.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Genius girl, our next meeting shall be as enemies!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Farewell! Muhahaha!”[%p]
I spin around and take off down the stairs, ignoring her call to stop. Like I’d listen to the enemy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn the Organization! They must be serious if they’re sending in agents like her!”[%p]
I run all the way down to the 4th floor and check behind me. Once I’m convinced Makise Kurisu’s not tailing me, I sigh while rubbing my temples.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I can’t let them capture me yet.”[%p]
Well then, what do I do now?[%p]
My mission was to attend the conference and evaluate Doctor Nakabachi’s research. Now that I know he’s a fraud, there’s no real point in going back.[%p]
I guess I’ll just go home.[%p]
But wait. Aren’t I forgetting something important?[%p]
Let’s see now... what is it?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Damn. I left Mayuri behind.”[%p]
I knew she’d be a liability.[%p]
I shouldn’t have brought her along. I was trying to prioritize her safety, but got careless.[%p]
I’ll try calling her first. If she’s alright, then I can just have her meet me here.[%p]
With that thought in mind, I take out my phone. I turn it on.[%p]
And it rings just as I do.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hm? An email?”[%p]
It’s not just a regular email. There’s a video attached.[%p]
And it’s from an unknown address.[%p]
I open the video file with some trepidation.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Hm?”[%p]
There’s nothing but noise.[%p]
Is this a prank? Or some sort of Makise Kurisu-style attack? Maybe the noise is some sort of make-people-go-crazy frequency.[%p]
...No, wait, I don’t remember giving her my mail address, so I’m probably just thinking too hard.[%p]
I curse myself for being gullible enough to play the video.[%p]
I have more pressing matters to deal with anyway.[%p]
I stop the video and call Mayuri’s phone from my address book.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Dammit, Mayuri. Why won’t you pick up?”[%p]
Looks like I’ll have to go back to the assembly hall.[%p]
But things will get messy if I bump heads with Makise Kurisu again.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait, don’t tell me! Did that femme fatale kidnap Mayuri!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn you! Is that how the Organization operates!?”[%p]
Leaving without Mayuri isn’t an option.[%p]
Call me overprotective, but she’s like a little sister to me, and there’s a very real danger that she might wander off somewhere the moment I let her out of my sight.[%p]
Mayuri has always been like that. I never know if she’ll be there when I turn to look.[%p]
...In a sense, that’s why I became Hououin Kyouma.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I have to go back for her.”[%p]
The thought of climbing back up to the 8th floor is depressing, but I have no choice.[%p]
When I get back to the assembly hall, Doctor Nakabachi’s conference has just finished.[%p]
Nobody is on stage, and the phony inventor has already left.[%p]
The 20 or so members of the audience are starting to pack up.[%p]
I soon find Mayuri.[%p]
She’s in the corner, looking lost.[%p]
Well, at least she wasn’t kidnapped.[%p]
Even better, I don’t see Makise Kurisu anywhere.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh, looks like I scared her off.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So be it. I’ll let her go this time.”[%p]
Still, I keep my eyes peeled as I run up to Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri! Why didn’t you pick up? We’re leaving.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin! My Metal Upa ran away.”[%p]
She turns to me with a forlorn expression.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ran away? What, it’s alive? That’s a little hard to believe.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I think I dropped it...”[%p]
I see, so she was looking for it.[%p]
Not like it really matters.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Forget about it. You can always get another one.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“No way. Metal Upas sell upwards of 10,000 yen online, you know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait... what?”[%p]
That toy was worth that much!?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Think, Mayuri! Where did you drop it!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I don’t know! That’s why I’m looking. And even if we find it, you can’t sell it, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Muhahaha! That 10,000 yen will fund my research!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I said you can’t sell it! It even has Mayushii’s name on it.”[%p]
Thus begins our search for the Metal Upa.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪ Upa, Upa, come out, come out, wherever you are!”[%p]
Mayuri tries calling its name. I don’t know if she truly expects a response.[%p]
By the way, “tutturu♪” is Mayuri’s catchphrase.[%p]
It means... actually, I’ve never bothered to ask what it means.[%p]
Anyway, the Metal Upa is nowhere to be found.[%p]
Maybe she didn’t drop it in the assembly hall, but on the 7th floor landing near the capsule toy machines.[%p]
Another possibility is that someone with an eye for rare items pilfered it.[%p]
Just imagining the smug grin on that person’s face makes me writhe in envy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What kind of man steals a helpless girl’s toy? Is there nothing in his heart but the lust for money!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Sounds like you, Okarin!”[%p]
Woah, wasn’t expecting that from Mayuri.[%p]
[name]???[line]“AHHHHHHHHHHH!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“!?”[%p]
Wh-what was that?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Was that a scream?”[%p]
I think so...[%p]
Only the presenter and a few other people are left in the assembly hall.[%p]
Including Mayuri and me, less than half the audience remains.[%p]
Everyone looks at each other anxiously, startled by the scream.[%p]
Even I cannot suppress a shiver.[%p]
First the explosion on the roof. Now this. What’s going on here?[%p]
Mayuri squeezes my hand tight.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stay here, Mayuri!”[%p]
I take a deep breath, prepare myself, and head in the direction of the scream.[%p]
The echoes lead me down a dark, empty hallway on the same floor.[%p]
I’m pretty sure it came from around that corner.[%p]
I crouch down and turn the corner slowly, keeping my eyes and ears peeled for any sign of danger.[%p]
And there, at the end of the passage, I see it.[%p]
There’s something on the ground.[%p]
No... some[color index="A0140000"]one[color index="800000"].[%p]
Motionless.[%p]
Who is it?[%p]
The clothes are familiar.[%p]
...It can’t be.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...”[%p]
Makise Kurisu...[%p]
Her face is turned away, but I know it’s her.[%p]
The impertinent genius girl I just fought with ten minutes ago...[%p]
...is now face down in a pool of bright red blood.[%p]
She’s dead.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No... but... why?”[%p]
Suddenly, I realize that I’m shaking.[%p]
I want to run. Run away.[%p]
I shouldn’t have come.[%p]
This is wrong.[%p]
Someone killed Makise Kurisu. There’s no other explanation.[%p]
Who would do such a thing?[%p]
There’s no one else here.[%p]
[name]Presenter[line]“Uwahhh!”[%p]
I twist around in shock.[%p]
Some other men have followed me.[%p]
And every one of them is ghastly pale. They must have seen the body.[%p]
[name]Presenter[line]“Call the police!”[%p]
A man cries out in panic. At this, everyone else starts screaming and running away.[%p]
I follow them, of course. There’s absolutely no reason to stay here.[%p]
Concern for Makise Kurisu is superseded by my instinctive urge to flee.[%p]
When I get back to the assembly hall, Mayuri is waiting for me with tears in her eyes.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What happened, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-we’re leaving!”[%p]
I grab Mayuri’s hand and run.[%p]
I race down the stairs, trying to drive the image of Kurisu’s dead body from my mind.[%p]
But I can’t.[%p]
The redness of her blood is burned into my mind, more than the sight of the body itself.[%p]
That was my first time seeing a dead body.[%p]
Is this what it’s like? When I realized that she was dead, I felt chilling terror and a surge of nausea. [%p]
But that was all I felt. Fear and disgust.[%p]
Shouldn’t there be something more?[%p]
I guess I just didn’t know her that well.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Haah, haah...”[%p]
I finally stop once we get out to the main street, Chuo-[color index="820000"]dori[color index="800000"].[%p]
My chest pounds, my breathing labored from running down the stairs at full speed.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, what happened? You look really pale...”[%p]
Mayuri doesn’t seem to comprehend the situation.[%p]
I guess it’s because she didn’t see the body.[%p]
She’s not even breathing hard.[%p]
She looks slow, but she’s actually pretty fast on her feet.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Someone... died.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Eh...”[%p]
I take several deep breaths.[%p]
The color of that blood still stains my brain.[%p]
But I’ve calmed down a bit.[%p]
Makise Kurisu is dead.[%p]
And I don’t know who the killer is.[%p]
Sirens in the distance. I guess an ambulance will be here soon.[%p]
Then the police will arrive, and this area will become a crime scene.[%p]
But for now, the crowds milling through Akihabara have no idea what has happened.[%p]
Everyone is going about their business as usual, the neverending search for electronics, [color index="820000"]moe[color index="800000"], and porn.[%p]
Just another day in Akihabara.[%p]
I take my phone out of my pocket, perhaps out of reflex.[%p]
I’m not sure what I plan to do with it.[%p]
Oh, I know. My friend Daru. I’ll tell him what happened just now, since he knows about Makise Kurisu.[%p]
I suppose it might be disrespectful to the victim.[%p]
But my adrenaline is pumping. I can’t make calm decisions after witnessing something like that firsthand.[%p]
That’s how humans are, after all.[%p]
We’re not as special as we like to believe.[%p]
At the end of the day, we’re nothing but dirty, slime-like flesh.[%p]
Our souls fester like semen left to rot in the womb.[%p]
That’s how we humans are.[%p]
While wallowing in a bit of angst, I begin to type on my phone.[%p]
“Someone stabbed Makise Kurisu. Don’t know who. Looked bad. Hope she’s okay.”[%p]
I don’t know if she was stabbed. That just seems like the most logical explanation, given the amount of blood and the absence of a gunshot.[%p]
On the other hand, I didn’t write that she was dead, even though I’m pretty sure she was.[%p]
I can’t exactly explain why I didn’t.[%p]
If I had to say, I guess I felt like writing it down would set it in stone.[%p]
It might make me feel guilty as well.[%p]
The thought brings a smirk to my face. It’s not like I’m the one who killed her. Why should I feel guilty?[%p]
I just saw someone’s death up close, and only a few minutes later, I’m smiling.[%p]
Am I really that cruel and cold?[%p]
Well, I am a fiendish mad scientist, so it suits me.[%p]
I finish typing and place my thumb over the send button.[%p]
And then...[%p]
I press down.[%p]
Sending...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha!?”[%p]
What was that?[%p]
Wait! Look around![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They’re gone...”[%p]
Summer break.[%p]
Noon.[%p]
The busiest street in town.[%p]
Just now, thousands of pedestrians vanished into thin air.[%p]
Is this a dream? Am I hallucinating?[%p]
I don’t know.[%p]
But they’re gone.[%p]
I saw them vanish with my own two eyes.[%p]
I stand petrified, speechless, and alone on the empty street.[%p]
Desperate to find someone, anyone, I look up.[%p]
And there, at the top of Radi-Kan...[%p]
Sticking out from the 8th floor event hall where we just were...[%p]
Is a crashed satellite.[%p]
