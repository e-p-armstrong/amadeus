[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, you. Can you see us?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why won’t you answer? I’m asking you a question. Yes, you on the other side of the monitor.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph. Your silence only strengthens my hypothesis.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I suppose that, from your perspective, it appears that we are the ones inside the monitor. Heh heh heh, but that’s where you’re wrong!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“For it is you who are inside! Your reality is nothing but lies and shadows. Naturally, that includes you, too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“True reality is on this side of the screen.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t believe me? I don’t blame you. Few are those who can handle the truth.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But no matter. I shall speak in simpler terms, easy enough for even you to understand.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is the Future Gadget Laboratory, located in the Akihabara district of Tokyo. We call it simply... the lab. Our purpose is to shatter [color index="820000"]the System[color index="800000"] and plunge the world into chaos.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really? You shouldn’t do bad things, Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Quiet. I’m a mad scientist, remember?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“From the station, head down Chuo-dori until you reach Suehirocho Station, then take a left onto Kuramaebashi-dori. In the alley before the traffic light, you’ll find the run-down Ohiyama Building. The lab is on the second floor.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“On the first floor is a store of ill repute called the [color index="820000"]Braun Tube[color index="800000"] Workshop. You can’t miss it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It deals exclusively in CRT monitors, of all things. Can you imagine? Even in the heart of Akihabara’s Electric Town, the demand for CRTs is practically nonexistent.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But the proprietor of the Braun Tube Workshop, Tennouji, is also the owner of the building.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s how he can afford to maintain his ridiculously niche hobby shop even as land value continues to rise.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“He may seem a rough sort, but he was no match for my charisma. Now the entire second floor is mine for next to nothing. Muhahaha!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I digress. The Future Gadget Laboratory is currently experiencing a severe shortage of manpower. We welcome dedicated scientists from all fields to apply. At present, our researchers are--”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin, Okarin. You’ve gotta say ’lab mems’, not researchers.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Our lab mems -- laboratory members -- are three!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am the founder of the Future Gadget Lab, Lab Mem Number 001, the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“’Okarin’ is cuter, though...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Next, we have our resident [color index="820000"]cosplayer[color index="800000"] and only female member, Lab Mem Number 002, Shiina Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪ Call me Mayushii! I like making costumes more than wearing them.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And last, we have our resident [color index="820000"]super hacka[color index="800000"], Lab Mem Number 003, Hashida Itaru.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Stop calling me that! It’s super [color index="A0140000"]hacker[color index="800000"], duh.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Here at the Future Gadget Laboratory, we devote ourselves to the art of invention!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“For details, see our lab’s homepage.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Our top priority, of course, is to develop weapons for the war with the Dark Dominion, but that research has spawned a number of offshoot inventions. In fact, that’s all it’s spawned.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Our arsenal of Future Gadgets is up to eight, but this is just the beginning. I have a total of 108 inventions to create!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Like in that tennis manga, right? I get it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No! It’s the number of earthly desires in mortals, you [color index="820000"]@channel[color index="800000"] junkie.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And I thought I told you not interrupt me when I’m talking!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah, wouldn’t want to interrupt you talking to yourself.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not talking to myself. Can’t you see? I’m talking to the person behind the monitor.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ah, he just grinned!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you grinning about, damn you!? You don’t even exist outside that monitor!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Just say ’[color index="820000"]don’t look at me[color index="800000"]’.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I don’t think that’s gonna work...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It appears our attempts to communicate have failed. It’s sad to see someone so deeply in denial of reality.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Maybe they think we’re in the game?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I doubt it’s even occurred to them.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But aren’t your [color index="820000"]2D girlfriends[color index="800000"] the same way?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s different. Those girls are my wives.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nobody cares about your harem.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But Mayushii touched upon a very interesting theme, ya know? What if we’re actually just characters in a game? Any way we can know for sure?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Come on!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Such questions are meaningless. Our time is better spent thinking of ways to destroy the System.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nice [color index="820000"]chuunibyou[color index="800000"], bro.”[%p]
I step back from the monitor.[%p]
Displayed on the screen is the uglycute character [color index="820000"]Alpacaman[color index="800000"].[%p]
This is a game called ’Alpacaman 2’, where you speak to Alpacaman via microphone and watch him react.[%p]
The game exploded in popularity when it was released 10 years ago, but personally, I find only the “ugly” part of “uglycute” to be true.[%p]
I bought it yesterday. 500 yen used. Headset included.[%p]
I turn to Daru with a menacing glare.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Shut it, hacka. I’m no chuunibyou patient.”[%p]
I sweep my hair back and flash a devilish grin.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am Hououin... Kyouma!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s your character’s name, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh Daru... your communication skills are beyond repair.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ll have you know I go to a ton of [color index="820000"]offline meets[color index="800000"], and I’m always the life of the party.”[%p]
This fat, bespectacled guy is my brother-in-arms and right-hand man, Hashida Itaru. Nickname: Daru.[%p]
He’s a hardcore [color index="820000"]otaku[color index="800000"]. You can always find him in front of the computer, playing games and watching anime.[%p]
He has 2D wives on whom he cheats with 3D maids. I don’t agree with his preferences, but to him, anything’s fine as long as it’s moe.[%p]
He’s the reliable and skilled partner who brings my ideas to fruition. Despite his insistence that software is his forte, he shows remarkable aptitude with hardware as well.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ow... the needle bit my finger...”[%p]
Over here, nursing a pricked finger, we have Shiina Mayuri. A 16-year-old high school student, if you can believe it. I’ve known her since we were both small.[%p]
She’s also an otaku. Nowhere near Daru’s level, though.[%p]
This ditzy girl is in charge of the lab’s official Costume Division (for Women), and today she’s working on costumes at her usual leisurely pace.[%p]
Why does the Future Gadget Laboratory need costumes (for women)?[%p]
It doesn’t.[%p]
The truth is that Mayuri is completely useless.[%p]
Still, there’s no way I would ever kick her out.[%p]
After all, she was the first one to join the Future Gadget Laboratory.[%p]
I still remember the day Mayuri first came to the lab. It was spring. She said to me:[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii is Okarin’s hostage! I belong here!”[%p]
Well, that certainly was cryptic.[%p]
But her offer was my salvation.[%p]
For she was the first to join me on my magnificent quest. She saved me from a solitary life on the run from the Organization.[%p]
I will never forget her kindness.[%p]
Mayuri doesn’t have to be useful. Her being here is enough.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So, did Alpacaman say anything?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nope. Nothing.”[%p]
The human-faced alpaca inside the monitor was completely unresponsive. So unresponsive you’d think the game was bugged.[%p]
Whatever, I give up.[%p]
Never again will I play this boring game.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn antisocial alpaca!”[%p]
I curse his name and smack the TV.[%p]
As soon as I do--[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hm?”[%p]
The TV makes a sound like it shorted, and then the screen goes blank.[%p]
I change the channel...[%p]
Nothing.[%p]
Check the power cable...[%p]
Nothing.[%p]
Whack it again...[%p]
Nothing.[%p]
I guess it’s broken. Damn.[%p]
This crummy TV is on lease from the Braun Tube Workshop downstairs.[%p]
It’s probably just old.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You made Mr.Alpaca angry!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn. I’ll have to get it repaired later.”[%p]
I turn off the TV and lie down on the couch.[%p]
I’m fed up with the humidity of Japanese summers. I stare at a conspicuous stain on the ceiling while fanning myself.[%p]
I close my eyes.[%p]
And what naturally comes to mind is that impossible scene I saw an hour ago.[%p]
