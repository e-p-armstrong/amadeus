[name]Rintaro[line]“They’re gone...”[%p]
As I left Radi-Kan, everyone vanished before my eyes. I can’t explain it.[%p]
And it wasn’t just the people on the street.[%p]
The people in the stores, gone. In the restaurants, gone. Even the cars vanished, drivers and all.[%p]
And it all happened in the blink of an eye.[%p]
Suddenly, an empty city spread before me.[%p]
I could still hear the music from the stores, but those catchy melodies were the only sounds of life remaining.[%p]
Heat was rising from the asphalt in waves, but I felt only a cold chill down my spine.[%p]
I just stood there, breathless, until--[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What’s wrong?”[%p]
Mayuri’s voice brought me back to reality.[%p]
Mayuri hadn’t disappeared.[%p]
She was right there, looking at me with questioning eyes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“E-everyone disappeared just now, right!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You saw it too, right!? Just now, before our very eyes!”[%p]
Panic took hold as the enormity of what had just happened struck me.[%p]
Unable to control myself, I grabbed Mayuri by her slender shoulders and shook her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you see it, Mayuri!? You saw it, right!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hmmm? Huhhhhh?”[%p]
Mayuri’s head flopped back and forth from my shaking.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“IIIII diiiiidn’t seeeee anythiiiiing!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You... didn’t?”[%p]
I stopped shaking her and looked straight into her eyes.[%p]
She returned my gaze with eyes clear as glass marbles.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You saw nothing? Nothing at all!? There were people here a second ago, weren’t there!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...There were?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Even the store employees are gone! That’s impossible by any measure!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Of course they are...”[%p]
Her reply didn’t make any sense.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It was like this when we got here. Oh, I know! You’re seeing things, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m sure it’s ’cause of the heat! Tutturu♪”[%p]
How could she laugh at a time like this?[%p]
I always thought she was a bit strange, but maybe her brain is actually broken.[%p]
I realized that she couldn’t help me.[%p]
With nowhere else to turn, I looked up at the bright blue sky.[%p]
There wasn’t a cloud in sight. The scorching summer sun shone bright through the gaps between Akiba’s buildings.[%p]
Naturally, my eyes drifted to the top floor of Radi-Kan, where I had been just a moment before.[%p]
There it was. An enormous machine, like some kind of satellite, embedded in the roof of the building where, not five minutes before, I had found Makise Kurisu’s body in a pool of blood.[%p]
What happened to her?[%p]
Just before everyone disappeared, I could’ve sworn I heard an ambulance siren.[%p]
Makise Kurisu might still be in that dark, narrow passageway -- cold, bloody, and alone.[%p]
The thought disturbed me, but the question at the forefront of my mind was...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What the hell is that satellite doing there?”[%p]
Right before Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation, the building shook like a bomb had exploded. The roof door lock had been broken, and beyond it someone had placed a satellite-like machine, shrouded in smoke and glowing dust.[%p]
When I first saw it, the satellite was “on” the rooftop.[%p]
But that’s not what I was seeing now.[%p]
This satellite had penetrated the top floor of the building, obliterating the room where Doctor Nakabachi’s press conference had been held.[%p]
It must have fallen out of orbit without burning up in the atmosphere, somehow.[%p]
I knew it was crazy, but what other explanation could there be?[%p]
The real question was...[%p]
When did that happen?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, about that satellite...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup. What a surprise, huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean? What was a surprise?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It made a huge ’kaplow’ sound!”[%p]
A huge ’kaplow’...[%p]
It certainly did make a sound.[%p]
But I don’t think it was “kaplow!”[%p]
I’d say it was more like “Zzzzzznnnmmm.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did that satellite fall out of the sky?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Did it? Do you think any aliens were on board?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Had I lost my mind?[%p]
What I had seen didn’t match at all with what Mayuri was saying.[%p]
Suddenly, nothing seemed real. Had I dreamt it all?[%p]
[name]Policeman[line]“Hey! You two!”[%p]
Just then, a uniformed policeman ran up to us, his expression stern.[%p]
[name]Policeman[line]“What do you think you’re doing here? This area is off-limits. You have to leave.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“We’re sorry!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“First, my good man -- let’s call you ’Officer A’ -- I have one question!”[%p]
[name]Officer A[line]“Officer A...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thousands of people just vanished! You saw it too, didn’t you!?”[%p]
[name]Officer A[line]“What are you talking about? Get out of here!”[%p]
I was quickly losing confidence in my own memories.[%p]
I decided to tell him about Makise Kurisu and get him to call an ambulance, but before I could--[%p]
[name]Officer A[line]“Look, I don’t have time for your nonsense.”[%p]
The policeman took me by the upper arm and said--[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]“No one got stabbed at Radi-Kan.”[%e]
What? How could he say that with such certainty?[%p]
While I was still trying to comprehend the situation, the policeman forcefully led us away.[%p]
We were escorted up to [color index="820000"]UPX[color index="800000"] and released.[%p]
There were people at UPX, like usual.[%p]
Actually, there were far more people than usual. The place was packed.[%p]
Just as Officer A had said, Chuo-dori had been blockaded by police, so nobody could enter.[%p]
There was nothing we could do, so we headed back to the lab.[%p]
And that brings us to the present.[%p]
I’m baffled.[%p]
Did the whole hour since the beginning of Nakabachi’s presentation really happen?[%p]
I check online for any news.[%p]
The net is buzzing about the mysterious machine that crashed into Radi-Kan.[%p]
All of the major stations in Tokyo -- even [color index="820000"]ToTV[color index="800000"] -- are running special bulletins about it.[%p]
Fortunately, it doesn’t look like anyone was hurt, but Chuo-dori is still closed off.[%p]
Akihabara Station is jammed with reporters and curious onlookers.[%p]
Nobody has mentioned anything about the disappearance of thousands of people from Akiba’s streets, nor about Makise Kurisu’s murder.[%p]
It’s all a mystery.[%p]
...A mystery?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see... so that’s it!”[%p]
From the sofa I spring to my feet, a wide grin on my face.[%p]
Daru and Mayuri turn and stare.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is all an elaborate coverup by the Organization! Their influence has corrupted local law enforcement, which means our entire government may already be under their control. My god!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But they underestimated me, for I am not so easily played. One day, I will expose their deeds and put an end to their reign!”[%p]
Having come to a satisfactory conclusion, I take a celebratory bottle of Dr P -- my favorite soda -- from the fridge.[%p]
The lab has no air conditioning. Ice cold drinks are essential.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah, [color index="A0140000"]elixir intellectualis[color index="800000"], a drink fit for a genius!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Cola’s better.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin really loves his Dr P!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I pity the man who knows not the greatness of this beverage! Muhahaha!”[%p]
