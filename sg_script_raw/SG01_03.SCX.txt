Step through the curtain dividing its center, and you’ll enter the heart of the Future Gadget Laboratory: the development room.[%p]
Just as the name implies, this is the room where we develop Future Gadgets. Needless to say, it is strictly off-limits to outsiders.[%p]
Yes, I know the setup is cheap -- I would much rather have an airlock than a curtain -- but our research budget is already scraping the bottom of the barrel.[%p]
Besides, what’s important isn’t money. It’s ambition.[%p]
I poke Daru and bid him follow me into the development room.[%p]
All of the windows here are weather stripped with packing tape, so it’s dim.[%p]
And hot, almost like a sauna.[%p]
I’ve been wanting to buy an air conditioner for the lab, but there’s no money for that. We’re currently accepting donations.[%p]
Upon entering the development room, I pick up the lab coat that’s lazily draped on the chair and put it on.[%p]
I always wear a lab coat in the development room. For practical reasons as well as symbolic ones.[%p]
Daru, however, refuses to wear his.[%p]
Putting it on and taking it off is apparently too much trouble for him. He can’t be bothered to do anything that doesn’t interest him. It’s men like him who give our generation a bad name.[%p]
His lab coat (purchased from my own pocket money, I might add) just sits on the shelf. It’s never been worn and probably never will be.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru. Is the plan progressing smoothly?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uh, what plan?”[%p]
Daru gives me a blank look.[%p]
I sigh and turn his attention to the table in the middle of the room.[%p]
Sitting majestically on top of the table is a commercial-grade [color index="820000"]microwave oven[color index="800000"]. It’s significantly larger than newer home models.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The plan, as in [color index="A0140000"]the plan[color index="800000"]. Obviously, I’m talking about perfecting Gadget No. 8.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, that. How was I supposed to know what you meant?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’ve known each other for what, three years now?”[%p]
We went to high school together. And now, we’re going to the same university. We share an inseparable bond, like prison cellmates. He’s only been a lab member for two months, though.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We were in different classes junior year, and actually we didn’t talk at all. So two years?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Details. The point is we’ve known each other a long time. I expect you to keep up with me here.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][center]”N O P E”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Awkward silence.[%p]
Man. All I wanted to do was have one of those cool cryptic conversations where we talk about “plans” and “preparations” and other important-sounding stuff but no one knows what it means except us.[%p]
Shot down again.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, are we any closer to figuring out what’s wrong with Gadget No. 8?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Not yet.”[%p]
So far, the Future Gadget Laboratory has completed a total of eight inventions.[%p]
As I explained to Alpacaman, the lab’s primary goal is to develop weapons for the war against the Dark Dominion, led by the Organization, that rules the world from the shadows.[%p]
At present, we haven’t completed any inventions of that sort. On the contrary. We haven’t even figured out what we should make.[%p]
But along the way, we have managed to create some ingenious Future-ish Gadgets as a byproduct of our research.[%p]
It is a fundamental truth of science that great inventions are often created by accident. In other words, [color index="820000"]serendipity[color index="800000"].[%p]
Allow me to introduce our glorious Future Gadgets.[%p]
Gadget No. 1, the [color index="820000"]Bit Particle Gun[color index="800000"].[%p]
Gadget No. 2, the [color index="820000"]Bamboo Helicam[color index="800000"].[%p]
Gadget No. 3, [color index="820000"]Could This Be Ora Ora!?[color index="800000"].[%p]
Gadget No. 4, [color index="820000"]Moad Snake[color index="800000"].[%p]
Gadget No. 5, [color index="820000"]’Once Again I’ve Made A Worthless Object’ by Goemon[color index="800000"].[%p]
Gadget No. 6, the [color index="820000"]Cyalume Saber[color index="800000"].[%p]
Gadget No. 7, [color index="820000"]Ghost in the Ball[color index="800000"].[%p]
They can all be seen on the website Daru made, so feast your eyes upon the product of a mad scientist’s genius.[%p]
Anyway, our current problem is Future Gadget No. 8, the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
“PhoneWave” is a pretty weak name, so I’ve added (name subject to change) to the end until we come up with something better. For the record, it was Mayuri’s idea, not mine.[%p]
When a Future Gadget is completed, the three of us discuss what to name it.[%p]
I prefer names based on mythology, or names with hidden meanings that need extra explanation to understand.[%p]
Daru thinks my naming style too ridiculous. He just doesn’t have a passion for words like I do.[%p]
Mayuri can’t be bothered to remember difficult names. She says they don’t “fit” in her head.[%p]
And so, our opinions on gadget names are always split.[%p]
But I digress.[%p]
The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is, in short, a remote-controlled microwave.[%p]
You put food into the microwave before you leave, then on your way back, call the attached cellphone to start the heating process. Voila! Hot food ready for your arrival.[%p]
...So it’s basically a piece of junk.[%p]
A few days ago, however, we discovered that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) has a second, unintended capability.[%p]
Our brave -- or possibly just ditzy -- Mayuri had made it her daily routine to heat some frozen fried chicken by remote control.[%p]
Long story short, she was defrosting her beloved “Juicy Chicken Number One!” as usual when the unexpected happened.[%p]
The chicken came out more frozen than when she’d put it in. The microwave [color index="A0140000"]refroze[color index="800000"] the chicken.[%p]
Since then, Daru and I have been searching for the cause.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We tried copying what Mayu-shi did, but we just can’t reproduce the freezing phenomenon.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And when we tried to freeze a banana, it turned out really weird.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I just don’t get it.”[%p]
Daru, now looking completely fed up with the heat, starts fanning himself with his shirt.[%p]
I know what he means by “really weird.”[%p]
Let’s see if we can’t make it happen again.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri! Mayuri! Bring forth the bananas!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Are you gonna turn them into gelbanas again?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s been bugging me, Mayu-shi. Can you stop calling them ’gelbanas’?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But gelbanas are gelbanas.”[%p]
I take the bananas from Mayuri and stick the whole bunch into the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Why do you have to use the whole bunch? It’s a waste of food.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your stinginess could cost us the battle with the Organization!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s fine with me. Mayushii always buys the bananas, and now Mayushii can’t eat a single one.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Next time, we’ll only do one banana.”[%p]
But I already put the whole bunch in, so I ignore her hungry complaints.[%p]
The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is simple to use.[%p]
It’s a microwave with a phone taped on.[%p]
The number is already in my address book. I just need to call the PhoneWave.[%p]
Now, where did I put my phone...[%p]
I check my pants and coat pockets.[%p]
I’m connected.[%p]
[name]Guidance[line][color index="8A0000"]“Hello. This is the PhoneWave (name subject to change).”[%p]
This is the voice of Mayushii Guidance, the system Daru programmed to operate the phonewave.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Do you hear Mayushii’s voice?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Be quiet. I’m trying to listen.”[%p]
[name]Guidance[line][color index="8A0000"]“You can operate the timer from this menu.”[%p]
[name]Guidance[line][color index="8A0000"]“After pushing the # button, please enter the heating time in seconds.”[%p]
[name]Guidance[line][color index="8A0000"]“For example, press ’#60’ for one minute.”[%p]
[name]Guidance[line][color index="8A0000"]“For two minutes, press ’#120’.”[%p]
Entering the command properly will cause the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to function like a normal microwave.[%p]
Instead, we’re going to deliberately mess up and enter “120#”.[%p]
When I enter the command, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) starts up with a low hum.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Won’t this just warm it normally?”[%p]
Crap, I messed up![%p]
I immediately shut it off.[%p]
Let’s try again.[%p]
This time, we’re going to ignore the guidance and enter “120#”.[%p]
Crap, I messed up.[%p]
Let’s start over.[%p]
I need to ignore the guidance and enter “120#”.[%p]
That should do it.[%p]
This method was originally a simple mistake on Mayuri’s part, but it somehow starts the freezing process.[%p]
The PhoneWave (name subject to change) comes to life.[%p]
The turntable begins to rotate.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nice turntable, right? It’s even spinning backwards.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Backwards!?”[%p]
I never noticed that![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That might have serious implications! If we look at quantum critical behavior driven by [color index="820000"]Hund’s rule[color index="800000"]--”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah! No.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...not Hund’s Rule?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“No.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...okay.”[%p]
The three of us wait and stare at the spinning bananas.[%p]
After 120 seconds pass, the microwave chimes.[%p]
Mayuri takes the bananas out.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Gelbanas are ready!”[%p]
The bananas have become... not-bananas. Gelatinous blobs coated with a thin membrane.[%p]
After Mayuri discovered that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) had a freezing function, we attempted to freeze a bunch of bananas. This is what happened.[%p]
It just gets more confusing each time.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru. You wouldn’t mind [color index="A0140000"]eating[color index="800000"] one of these, would you? Of course you wouldn’t. It’s for science! Your sacrifice will forever be remembered!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...They look really nasty.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The taste doesn’t matter. What matters is that you eat it! So come on, Daru, no need to be shy. Break a leg, or a stomach, and go for it!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“No way.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Fine. Mayuri! The honor shall be yours.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But gelbanas are all gloopy, droopy, soft, and squishy.”[%p]
Wait, she already tried one?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It had no flavor and wasn’t tasty at all...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gloopy, droopy, soft and squishy... Daru, what do you think?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Soft and squishy bananas, huh... Soft and squishy... banana...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Mayu-shi, say ’your banana’s all soft and squishy’ for me.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Daru-kun, your nose is bleeding.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Please just say it!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Your banana’s all soft and--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t make her say that, you perv!”[%p]
Daru retreats after I hit him with a tissue box.[%p]
Mayuri looks at us with an innocent smile. She doesn’t get it, obviously.[%p]
Anyway.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They’re gelatinous, a semi-solid state of matter. In other words, there is a possibility that the intermolecular bonds were weakened.”[%p]
What could have partially liquified the bananas...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve got it!”[%p]
I turn to the whiteboard and write “FREEZING” in the middle. Then, I cross it out and slap the board with my hand.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What we thought was a freezing function is actually something else!”[%p]
A bold statement, if I do say so myself.[%p]
...So why isn’t anyone surprised?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now’s the time to shout, ’W-what you say!?’ Come on, don’t be shy!”[%p]
Their reactions are pathetically weak.[%p]
Mayuri probably didn’t even understand half of what I said...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uh, we already knew that.”[%p]
...Oh.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The problem is we don’t know what it [color index="A0140000"]is[color index="800000"] doing, or why it’s doing it.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“If it’s the opposite of freezing, then couldn’t it be thawing them?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What a silly question, Mayuri. What you’re describing is just a normal microwave!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Then, what is it?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We don’t know, and that’s the problem.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
He’s right. To be honest, I haven’t a clue.[%p]
