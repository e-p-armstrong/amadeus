[name]Rintaro[line]“...so hot.”[%p]
I was at university all morning. As I return to Akiba the heat is now becoming unbearable.[%p]
I grab an ice coffee at the bakery inside Yodobashi to quench my thirst.[%p]
While I’m at it, I guess I’ll check @channel on my phone.[%p]
I mostly frequent the occult board, the future technology board, and sometimes the physics board.[%p]
I search for threads on the mass disappearance phenomenon or Makise Kurisu’s stabbing, but turn up nothing.[%p]
So were those hallucinations after all?[%p]
When I peek at the occult board, I find posts in multiple threads from someone claiming to be “John Titor”.[%p]
Wait. John Titor is back?[%p]
John Titor appeared on an American BBS 10 years ago, claiming to be a time traveler.[%p]
He claimed to have traveled from the year 2036 in order to obtain an old computer, the [color index="820000"]IBN 5100[color index="800000"]. His claims started quite a storm among the BBS denizens.[%p]
Titor also made several accurate -- if fragmentary -- predictions of future events.[%p]
The start of the Iraq War, and the spread of [color index="820000"]Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease[color index="800000"], for example.[%p]
To prove he was from the future, he explained the principles behind his time machine and provided pictures of its operation manual.[%p]
But after about four months, he disappeared without ever revealing his identity.[%p]
At one point, his predictions gained popularity even in Japan.[%p]
Yes, he certainly did get some things right.[%p]
But on the other hand, he missed several others. Some of his posts contradicted each other, too. That’s why, to this day, most people doubt his authenticity as a time traveler.[%p]
So after ten years of silence, that same John Titor is now on a Japanese BBS?[%p]
Ridiculous. It’s obviously a [color index="820000"]troll[color index="800000"].[%p]
First of all, John Titor is American. Yet now, he’s posting on @channel in Japanese.[%p]
Let’s take a look at his posts.[%p]
Looks like they’ve already made an archive of these threads.[%p]
Of course, there have been sites dedicated to John Titor for years now.[%p]
This post closely resembles what the original Titor wrote 10 years ago.[%p]
I’ve read one of the books on Titor. That’s how I know.[%p]
This new John Titor is clearly an impostor.[%p]
There are many Titor fanatics on @channel.[%p]
He’s not exactly a household name in Japan, but I doubt anyone would fall for this level of trolling.[%p]
As I continue to read, however, I find the response the opposite of what I expected.[%p]
Everyone is accepting this “time traveler” as if this were his first appearance.[%p]
Nobody has even mentioned his appearance 10 years ago.[%p]
Finding this strange, I try posting a retort, but everyone ignores me.[%p]
What the hell?[%p]
You can figure this out if you do a little research, people![%p]
There’s the original John Titor thread archive in English, and plenty of Titor blogs in Japanese.[%p]
I enter John Titor’s name into a search engine.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]12 matches.[%e]
Wait... only 12?[%p]
Moreover, all 12 are about the current Titor’s postings on @channel.[%p]
I can’t find a single trace of the Titor from 10 years ago.[%p]
Bizarre. This just can’t be.[%p]
I searched for information on Titor a few years ago. Back then, I got tens of thousands of hits.[%p]
Is this search engine filtered?[%p]
I try searching on another site just to make sure, but it gives the same result.[%p]
What is this madness?[%p]
It feels like I’ve stumbled onto another plane of reality.[%p]
Could this be another Organization conspiracy?[%p]
These past two days, I’ve been surrounded by nothing but chaos and confusion.[%p]
I’ll call Daru.[%p]
He’ll know about Titor for sure.[%p]
After all, I’ve talked to him about Titor before.[%p]
I only vaguely remember the details of that conversation.[%p]
But I’m positive the conversation happened.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Yeah?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. Report.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“...Okarin, can you drop the act when you’re on the phone at least?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you aware that John Titor has returned?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where are you, anyway? You coming to the lab?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“I’m at MayQueen+Nyan².”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Again?”[%p]
MayQueen+Nyan² is a [color index="820000"]maid cafe[color index="800000"] in Akiba.[%p]
Daru’s a regular there. Apparently, 3D cat maids are his thing too.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I have a sensitive matter to discuss.”[%p]
Actually, it’s not sensitive at all.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t move until I get there.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Huh? You’re coming? Fine, bu--”[%p]
By the time I dig my phone out of my bag, I no longer feel like making the call.[%p]
Instead, I send him an email on the way back to the lab. He replies with his location.[%p]
By “MayQueen”, he means “MayQueen+Nyan²”, a [color index="820000"]maid cafe[color index="800000"].[%p]
Daru’s a regular there. Apparently, 3D cat maids are his thing too.[%p]
