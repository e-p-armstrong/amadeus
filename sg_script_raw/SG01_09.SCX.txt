MayQueen+Nyan² is only a three minute walk from the lab.[%p]
Coming from Kuramaebashi-dori, take a left at Tsumakoisaka Crossing and you’ll find it.[%p]
That’s where I’m headed now.[%p]
It’s usually busy in Akiba during summer break, but now it’s even busier because of the Radi-Kan incident.[%p]
The area was blocked off yesterday, but it doesn’t look like they could keep the main road closed for two days straight. I haven’t seen a single police officer today.[%p]
But the Radi-Kan building still seems off limits. The entrance shutters are closed shut and sealed with yellow police tape.[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]“We’re here now in Akihabara the day after the unexplained satellite crash. The police barricade has been lifted, and a tremendous number of people have gathered in front of the station!”[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]“The satellite’s origin is still under investigation. We’re told that it can’t be removed until the authorities have more information.”[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]“According to the police, the satellite does not appear to be dangerous. However, tourists and local business owners have raised concerns.”[%p]
The media has dozens of cameras set up outside of the police line.[%p]
And there are nearly twice as many onlookers as reporters. Enough to fill the entire street with people. Everyone’s aiming their phone cameras at the satellite-like object.[%p]
So many people...[%p]
Living in Akiba, you get used to crowds and big events, but a gathering of this size is unusual.[%p]
I wonder when they’ll get rid of that thing. I hope it doesn’t explode or something.[%p]
They’ve been letting people back into the area, so I guess there’s no danger.[%p]
Still, considering its unknown origin, I’m surprised there isn’t more security.[%p]
Today, like always, otaku are shopping for [color index="820000"]doujinshi[color index="800000"], import games, electronics, or whatever strikes their fancy.[%p]
Aside from the scene at Radi-Kan, it’s the same as any other day.[%p]
But I still don’t understand what I saw yesterday.[%p]
I’ve half accepted that the mass disappearance was just my imagination.[%p]
Maybe I’ve become unable to distinguish reality from fantasy, like the media likes to say about teenagers these days.[%p]
With that thought in mind, I return my gaze to the street.[%p]
And there, in front of me, stands a woman holding her phone in front of her face.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!?”[%p]
She took a picture.[%p]
Her phone was clearly pointed at me.[%p]
I tried to cover my face, but not quickly enough.[%p]
I turn around just to make sure that she wasn’t pointing it at someone behind me, but that doesn’t seem to be the case.[%p]
[name]???[line]“...”[%p]
She’s still staring at her phone.[%p]
Without even glancing at me, she turns around and points her phone at some other pedestrian.[%p]
Maybe she’s just taking photos of everyone at the scene, and not just me.[%p]
But still, I need to have a word with her.[%p]
The Organization is after me, so I can’t risk that photo getting out.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait wait wait!”[%p]
[name]Lady[line]“...”[%p]
She doesn’t turn around.[%p]
Is she so engrossed in her photography that she doesn’t even notice me?[%p]
Or did she not catch my magnificent, native-level English?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, you with the phone camera! Wait! Please, wait!”[%p]
[name]Lady[line]“...?”[%p]
She turns back, finally noticing me.[%p]
And of course, her phone turns with her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey! No pictures! Are you with the Organization!?”[%p]
[name]Voyeur Lady[line]“...”[%p]
She completely ignores my objection.[%p]
And then she goes back to looking at her phone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Answer my question. Are you with the Organization?”[%p]
If she is, then I may have to take suitable measures.[%p]
[name]Possible Organization Spy[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-you’re not?”[%p]
[name]Probably Not Organization Spy[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Even so, I can’t let you keep that picture. The Organization will stop at nothing to find my whereabouts, and they’ll kill anyone who gets in their way!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I need you to delete that picture immediately.”[%p]
[name]Lady Ignoring Me[line]“...”[%p]
Is she even listening?[%p]
[name]Lady Ignoring Me[line]“...Sorry.”[%p]
Wow, she finally speaks. Just a whisper, but it’s something.[%p]
[name]Lady Who Apologized out of Nowhere[line]“If I... upset you.”[%p]
She lowers her head slightly in a bow.[%p]
Or at least I think it’s a bow. She’s been looking down all this time, so I can’t really tell.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Before you apologize, I need you to delete that photo.”[%p]
[name]Lady Ignoring Me[line]“I was shooting... the scenery.”[%p]
Her fingers dance across her phone’s keys with impressive speed, exactly the opposite of her annoyingly slow speech pattern.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The scenery? You’re a tourist?”[%p]
Or is she one of the people who came to see the satellite?[%p]
In that case, why did she take a picture of me?[%p]
She shakes her head without looking at me.[%p]
[name]Lady Ignoring Me and Apparently Sightseeing in Akihabara[line]“...It’s proof. Of where I was today.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re a strange lady...”[%p]
[name]Strange Lady Apparently Sightseeing in Akihabara[line]“Kiryu... Moeka.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hm?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“My name.”[%p]
I guess she’s introducing herself.[%p]
That’s nice, but I just want her to delete that photo.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I have a question for you... may I?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“First, the photo--”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“There’s an urban legend... in Akihabara.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Have you heard of it?”[%p]
An urban legend?[%p]
What is she talking about?[%p]
Don’t tell me. There is a brilliant but insane mad scientist said to be lurking in Akihabara?[%p]
And now, that brilliant but insane mad scientist is the target of every assassin in the underworld?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gah... I’ve remained in this town for far too long! I’ll need to make plans.”[%p]
Akihabara. You weren’t such a bad town. I’m glad th--[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“The phantom... retro PC.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Retro PC?”[%p]
She replies with a nod... or something like a nod.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“They say there’s one... in Akihabara.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh...”[%p]
Nothing about a mad scientist.[%p]
I’m relieved, but also disappointed.[%p]
At any rate, this is the first I’ve heard about a phantom retro PC.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A retro PC... you mean like a [color index="820000"]98[color index="800000"]?”[%p]
That’s the first model that comes to mind.[%p]
But are 98s really that hard to find?[%p]
She shakes her head slightly... or something like a shake.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...No. This.”[%p]
She turns her phone towards me.[%p]
The screen shows an oddly shaped computer.[%p]
It’s hard to tell since the picture’s monochrome, but it looks like some kind of PC. [%p]
It looks kind of familiar.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“An IBN 5100.”[%p]
An IBN 5100...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s the computer John Titor tried to get.”[%p]
Her fingers twitch... I think.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You’ve seen one?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No. I’ve only heard the name.”[%p]
Coincidence?[%p]
No...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This could be the choice of Steins Gate.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Know anyone... who might know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru probably knows more about it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“He’s my Favorite Right Arm. A super hacka capable of breaking into even [color index="820000"]MI6’s[color index="800000"] mainframe.”[%p]
The MI6 part is a slight exaggeration. If that ever did happen, men in black would break down our door and take us away.[%p]
But the super hacka part is true.[%p]
The depth of his computer knowledge is uncanny.[%p]
Speaking of Daru, I’m supposed to meet him at MayQueen+Nyan². I don’t have time to stand and chat with some crazy lady I don’t know.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, I’m off. Lady, [color index="820000"]media scrum[color index="800000"] in moderation.”[%p]
I try to make a smooth exit, one-liner and everything, but she grabs my sleeve before I can disappear into the crowd.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing!?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Your email... please.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What are you after?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“The super hacka...”[%p]
I guess she wants to hear Daru’s story.[%p]
It’s my fault for mentioning him.[%p]
Well, I’m meeting up with Daru, so why don’t I just take her along?[%p]
...No, wait a second.[%p]
This could be a devious trap.[%p]
Maybe she’s really a spy sent to kidnap Daru.[%p]
I’m defenseless without him.[%p]
My only other ally is Mayuri, whose skills amount to costume design.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I refuse! I’ll never give up Daru!”[%p]
I slip past her and start walking faster.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I glance back.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
She’s following me.[%p]
I pick up the pace.[%p]
But she’s still chasing me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stop following me!”[%p]
Unperturbed, she shows me her phone again.[%p]
On the screen is the picture of me that she took. [%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gehhh! You still haven’t deleted it?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Tell me... and I’ll delete it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You dare blackmail me? Who do you work for?”[%p]
I attempt to glare her into submission.[%p]
But her eyes are already lowered. My glare is ineffective![%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I...”[%p]
She hesitates for a second.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Work part-time... at Arc Rewrite.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s that?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“An editorial company... here in Akihabara.”[%p]
One of those companies that writes articles for magazines?[%p]
Is this gloomy lady really fit for that kind of work?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait! You plan on publishing my picture without permission, don’t you!?”[%p]
“The mad scientist of Akiba, unveiled!” I can see the headlines now.[%p]
That’s all the Organization will need to turn Akiba into an sea of blood.[%p]
No. I must avoid that gruesome outcome at all costs.[%p]
I have no choice.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Very well. I accept your terms.”[%p]
At any rate, as long as she has that photo, I have no way of knowing how it might be used.[%p]
I pull up my email address and show it to her.[%p]
Looking back and forth from my phone to hers, she enters my info with terrifying speed.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course... this woman is an [color index="820000"]esper[color index="800000"].”[%p]
I dub her power... Shining Finger! Her magical thumb types cursed emails at 255 characters per minute. Whoever receives one dies.[%p]
She’s done typing my address. It took all of five seconds.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Name?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hououin Kyouma, Mad Scientist.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“How... is it spelled?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“First ’Houou’ for ’phoenix’, then ’in’, and finally ’Kyouma’ which means a ’horrible truth’ that must never be revealed.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“’Houou’ for ’phoenix’, then ’in’, and finally ’Kyouma’ which means a ’horrible truth’ that must never be revealed.”[%p]
I repeat my perfect explanation.[%p]
This is the origin of my true name.[%p]
Explaining the ’in’ part of ’Hououin’ would take too long, so I left it out.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
She enters my name with her head tilted to the side.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Like this?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What the hell is this!? Are you mocking me!?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
She lowers her head a little more. An apologetic bow, I guess.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just hand me your phone! I’ll enter it!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...!”[%p]
She shakes her head, clutching her phone with both hands as if to protect it from me.[%p]
Like a spoiled child who can’t let go of a toy, she shields it from me with all her might.[%p]
What does she think I’m going to do? Her reaction is a little depressing.[%p]
Anyway, she’s obviously not going to hand her phone over, so I ask for her address instead. I’ll send her a blank mail.[%p]
She told me her name a few minutes ago, but I forgot it already, so I enter her as “Shining Finger.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
What am I doing standing here in the middle of the street?[%p]
Let’s hurry up and send her a blank email.[%p]
I don’t need to type anything.[%p]
It’s just to give her my name.[%p]
I already put her in my contacts. Just send a blank email to Shining Finger.[%p]
And send.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Her phone doesn’t react, and she gives me a questioning look.[%p]
As I begin to wonder why it didn’t go through--[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Woah!”[%p]
Suddenly, my phone starts ringing.[%p]
I look at the screen and see that Daru’s calling me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. What is it?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“What do you mean, ’what is it’? I’ve been waiting, you know? And what’s with that blank email?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Blank email? It went to you?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“It sure did.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That was a mistake. Don’t worry. The email will self-destruct in 10 minutes.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Hey, just what are--”[%p]
I sent the email to the wrong address.[%p]
It’s no wonder she didn’t get it.[%p]
Let’s try sending it again.[%p]
I press the End button and ignore Daru’s call.[%p]
Her phone’s not getting the email no matter how long we wait, so let’s try again.[%p]
And, send.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
She’s staring at her phone.[%p]
I don’t think I’ve ever met someone who made less eye contact.[%p]
After a few seconds, her phone receives the email.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Okabe... Rintaro?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What!? How do you know that name!?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“From the blank email...”[%p]
Damn, my email is still linked to my real name.[%p]
I must change it at once![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s just my alias. I’ll send another one with my true--”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“No... this is fine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nonsense! I am not Okabe Rintaro, but Hououin Kyou--”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
She’s really not buying it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you delete the picture?”[%p]
She nods slightly... I think.[%p]
It’s really hard to tell. Her body language is as subdued as her voice.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you deleted it, then prove it.”[%p]
She silently shows me her screen.[%p]
The only picture remaining is the one of that computer.[%p]
That’s a relief.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’ll email you... later.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“So ask... okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“About what?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...The urban legend.”[%p]
Oh, that.[%p]
I almost forgot.[%p]
With that, Shining Finger wanders off.[%p]
Throughout the encounter, she kept the same cool expression.[%p]
Actually, I don’t think we ever once made eye contact.[%p]
And, send.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Her phone doesn’t react, and she gives me a look that seems to ask something.[%p]
Why won’t it transfer?[%p]
We both look at her phone’s screen in bewilderment.[%p]
What’s wrong? This is so annoying. I’ll send it again.[%p]
And, send.[%p]
...[%p]
Her phone doesn’t react, and she gives me a look, like she wants to asks something.[%p]
Why won’t it transfer?[%p]
We both examine her phone’s screen.[%p]
This is getting annoying. I’ll send it again.[%p]
And, send.[%p]
...[%p]
Her phone is silent. She looks at me as if to ask something.[%p]
What’s going on with the transfer?[%p]
We both look at her phone’s screen in bewilderment.[%p]
I’ll try to send it again.[%p]
And, send.[%p]
...[%p]
Her phone doesn’t react, and she gives me a look that seems to ask something.[%p]
Why won’t it transfer?[%p]
We both look at her phone’s screen in bewilderment.[%p]
I’ll try to send it again.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
She frowns while looking at her own phone.[%p]
And then she glances my way.[%p]
I can feel those eyes clearly saying “hurry up.”[%p]
But I’m hesitant.[%p]
I’m not sure if it’s a good idea to give her my true name.[%p]
But regardless of how long I hesitate, I don’t think that she’ll let me go until I send her the email.[%p]
She sure is persistent.[%p]
Looks like I have no choice but to send the email.[%p]
We exchange a few words, and then I get away from her as fast as I can.[%p]
