I had to pull Daru away from Faris so we could return to the lab. We arrive to find it hotter than a sauna in hell.[%p]
I quickly open the windows, letting a small breeze blow in. It won’t be enough.[%p]
I flip our fan to full power and place it on the table in front of me.[%p]
I really wish we had an air conditioner.[%p]
I turn on the computer.[%p]
This is our PC for communal use among lab members. It still uses an old [color index="820000"]CRT[color index="800000"] monitor, so it looks ancient.[%p]
But don’t let its looks deceive you. Our computer wiz, Daru, scrounged up some parts and made some mods to it.[%p]
In any case, I don’t spend much time on it. I mostly use it to update the Future Gadget Laboratory’s homepage, check my email, visit news sites, and browse @channel.[%p]
I wonder if the “new” Titor is still posting.[%p]
