Woah, I shouldn’t waste all day on @channel.[%p]
We have more important things to deal with.[%p]
Namely, the PhoneWave (name subject to change). We haven’t experimented with it since yesterday.[%p]
It’s high time I figure out what’s going on with that thing.[%p]
Earlier, I asked Daru to connect the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to the computer.[%p]
He finished setting it up yesterday, and now he’s about to do the quick wire work in the development room.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Daru. What’s with the [color index="820000"]X68000[color index="800000"]?”[%p]
I mean, it’s a 20-year-old machine with specs lower than my cellphone.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s cool. Duh.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, it’s like the reason why some protagonists are [color index="820000"]odd-eyed[color index="800000"] even though they’re Japanese?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Not getting you, bro.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s cool.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“If it’s cool, then it’s cool.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Anyway, there wasn’t much of an option. This was the only PC we weren’t using.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What about your new one?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“No way. We don’t know what could happen when it’s connected to your crazy machine. It could kill the performance.”[%p]
Selfish bastard.[%p]
Besides, we made the PhoneWave (name subject to change) together. It’s “our” crazy machine.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Anyway, did you do any research on the gelification?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, at the university this morning.”[%p]
Why would a banana gelify? What kind of science are we dealing with here?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I examined a sample under a microscope and found it was shredded at the molecular level.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Shredded?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not a mere [color index="820000"]phase transition[color index="800000"]. The banana became something entirely different.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Could it have rotted? ...Nah. There’s no way 2 minutes in the microwave could do that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then I remembered about [color index="820000"]fractal structures[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The [color index="820000"]Menger sponge[color index="800000"] thing?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. It looked like something drilled holes into the banana. An infinite number of holes in a fractal pattern, right down to the nano level.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whoa. What could do something like that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I have one hypothesis...”[%p]
Adding a dramatic pause to build tension.[%p]
Daru gulps, waiting for me to continue.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s the result of the microwave’s electromagnetic waves.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“W-what does that mean?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If my guess is correct, then our PhoneWave (name subject to change) has the potential to become a weapon of unprecedented destructive power, one that could change the face of war as we know it. Hehehe.”[%p]
I twist my lips into a maniacal grin.[%p]
Then I whip out my phone and put it to my ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. We’re proceeding to stage two of the plan. Soon they will learn... that Judgment Day is near.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“All shall be as Steins Gate wills. Resistance is futile. El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Quit talking to your imaginary friend. I’m done with the wiring.”[%p]
I want to explain that he’s not imaginary, but revealing the identity of my contact would be a betrayal.[%p]
The last thing I need is another enemy, especially one whose power and cunning rivals that of the Organization.[%p]
The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is now an indecipherable mess of wires.[%p]
All we did was hook it up to a computer, yet it turned out like something [color index="820000"]MacDyver[color index="800000"] would put together.[%p]
Now we can access the microwave’s [color index="820000"]terminal mode[color index="800000"] and see exactly what’s going on in its computer brain.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well? What’s next?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We have bananas.”[%p]
Just before I left MayQueen+Nyan², Mayuri asked me to buy some bananas.[%p]
With her money.[%p]
She’s too nice for her own good. Or maybe she didn’t even consider what would happen.[%p]
By now, you’d think she’d know that if I buy bananas, I’m going to experiment on them.[%p]
And so, I put the entire bunch of bananas into the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You know Mayu-shi’s gonna cry if you use them all, right? Wasn’t it her money?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She donated that money to our research efforts.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You don’t have to use the whole thing. One is enough. One.”[%p]
Daru retrieves the bananas, peels one from the bunch, and sticks it back inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’ll never reshape the fabric of society as long as money dictates the limits of our science.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’re the only one who wants to reshape society, Okarin.”[%p]
He lost all enthusiasm the second we got back to the lab.[%p]
What a fickle man.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“C’mon, start the timer already.”[%p]
Right. Now, where did I put my phone...[%p]
Phone, phone...[%p]
Call complete.[%p]
Instant access.[%p]
[name]Guidance[line][color index="8A0000"]“Hello. This is the PhoneWave (name subject to change).”[%p]
The Mayushii Guidance system.[%p]
[name]Guidance[line][color index="8A0000"]“You can operate the timer from this menu.”[%p]
[name]Guidance[line][color index="8A0000"]“After pushing the # button, please enter the heating time in seconds.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In hindsight, we should’ve made the Mayushii Guidance skippable. Having to wait each time is quite annoying.”[%p]
[name]Guidance[line][color index="8A0000"]“For example, press ’#60’ for one minute.”[%p]
[name]Guidance[line][color index="8A0000"]“For two minutes, press ’#120’.”[%p]
It’s finally over.[%p]
Ok, entering “120#”...[%p]
When I finish typing, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) starts up with a low hum.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You messed up.”[%p]
Crap, this is just normal heating.[%p]
I manually set the timer back to 0 and start typing again.[%p]
This time, we’re going to ignore the guidance and enter “120#”.[%p]
Crap, I messed up.[%p]
Let’s start over.[%p]
Ignore the guidance and enter “120#”.[%p]
Complete.[%p]
The turntable inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change) begins to spin backwards.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Two minutes sure is long...”[%p]
It doesn’t actually have to be two minutes. Mayuri had the timer set to two minutes when she first discovered the freezing function -- or whatever it is -- so we’re just reproducing that.[%p]
Naturally, we have experimented with 60 seconds and 180 seconds too.[%p]
If we set it shorter, the freezing only goes halfway, if at all. Conversely, setting it longer increases the effect.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You know, if the microwave’s emissions are doing it, then shouldn’t our cells be getting gelified too?”[%p]
While still looking bored, Daru finally gets into the discussion at hand.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, have you ever nuked yourself inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change)?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I can’t even fit in there.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Anyway, what’s your source on the electromagnetic waves?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you must know... it’s my mad scientist’s intuition.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, so no facts.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Edison once said, ’Without one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent of perspiration is wasted. So, inventors of the world... be inspired!’ End quote.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wasn’t it ’Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration’?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry to disappoint, but in recent years it’s become common knowledge that [color index="A0140000"]that[color index="800000"] is a misquote. Muhahaha!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Edison said that? ’Be inspired!’...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes. ’Be inspired!’ he said.”[%p]
I don’t know if that was exactly what he said, but I’m sure it was something along those lines.[%p]
At least, that’s what the wiki said.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Therefore, as a genius mad scientist, I am always insp--”[%p]
The PhoneWave (name subject to change) rings.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is just going to gelify the banana like usual, isn’t it? We need a new experiment.”[%p]
It feels like I wasted 120 seconds on nothing.[%p]
Daru opens the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s door and peeks inside.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What? What!?”[%p]
He rubs his eyes, blinks several times, then resumes staring into the microwave.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well... uh... it’s...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...gone.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gone? What’s gone?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The banana.”[%p]
What is he talking about?[%p]
I push Daru aside and look into the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...It’s gone.”[%p]
There’s nothing inside.[%p]
The banana has vanished without a trace.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
After a short pause to collect myself, I whip out my phone and speak into the silence.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. Slight problem. We may have awakened something... terrible.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wh-what do you mean something terrible!?”[%p]
I ignore Daru’s panicked cry.[%p]
I’m surprised too. My heart’s pounding. But I try to appear calm.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m invoking Emergency Order 666. Activate the Coldheart Protocol!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What!? What do you mean we need congressional approval!? There’s no time, you fool! Tokyo will be blasted to atoms!”[%p]
I put my phone away after yelling.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Y-you should be an actor.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“S-shut up, you Faris stalker! Where’d you hide the banana?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Who’s a stalker!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The banana. Where is it? Are you planning on become a street magician or something?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’re the one who hid it, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...”[%p]
Uncomfortable silence.[%p]
I realize my throat is dry.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where the hell did it go!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“How should I know!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where did you go? Banaana! BANAAANA!”[%p]
I take the turntable out of the microwave, scour every nook and cranny, but find neither peel nor stem of the banana.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-wait... I think I get it now! It’s not an electromagnetic weapon, it’s a teleportation device!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wh-what!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, that’s absurd.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How else could it have vanished? The microwave was closed!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Um, maybe we should just calm down.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-yeah. You’re right...”[%p]
We each take a deep breath.[%p]
Oh, I know. I’ll eat one of the remaining bananas. That will calm me down.[%p]
I reach for the bunch of bananas.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What... the...!?”[%p]
Impossible.[%p]
Impossible![%p]
Not three minutes ago, Daru plucked a banana from the bunch and put it inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
But now, there’s no sign that a banana was ever plucked.[%p]
Instead, a single gelified banana has appeared among the regular bananas.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh shit! What the hell’s going on?”[%p]
Daru notices it too.[%p]
He reaches out to touch it, but I quickly stop him.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait! How many bananas are in the lab right now!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“J-just these, I think...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is this gelbana attached to the same stem as the banana you just picked?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I dunno, man... I wasn’t paying attention.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It doesn’t look like it was ever plucked...”[%p]
No cuts or anything.[%p]
Aside from the gelification, it looks completely normal.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“H-hey, Daru... could this possibly be...”[%p]
The word I spoke impulsively a few seconds ago.[%p]
I hesitate to speak it again.[%p]
But I must.[%p]
Because no matter how unbelievable it may be, we saw it with our own eyes![%p]
My head’s full of question marks. I don’t know how this happened. But if I were to explain it as I saw it...[%p]
The banana that was inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change) returned instantly to its bunch. In other words...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A teleporter... we’ve invented a teleporter!”[%p]
