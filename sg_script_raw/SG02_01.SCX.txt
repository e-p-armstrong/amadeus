The dawn of a new day.[%p]
Actually, it’s already noon. We didn’t sleep at all.[%p]
Sleep deprivation makes the summer sun seem all the brighter.[%p]
I really don’t want to go outside, but I’m fed up with the humidity inside the lab.[%p]
I chug a bottle of Dr P.[%p]
My stomach protests. Maybe I drank too fast.[%p]
I’m exhausted. My hands are shaking slightly, and my vision is cloudy.[%p]
I could pass out if I’m not careful.[%p]
Maybe I should take a shower. That should stave off exhaustion, if only temporarily.[%p]
This building has a basic shower room. There’s no bath, but it’s enough. The lab would be hell without it.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...”[%p]
Daru is at his computer, his back turned towards me.[%p]
His right leg is bouncing impatiently.[%p]
The room is mostly silent, save for the electric fan’s humming and Daru’s mouse clicks.[%p]
Daru doesn’t look my way, and he doesn’t try to start a conversation.[%p]
Neither do I. I don’t have the energy.[%p]
Outside is a sunny summer afternoon. But inside the air is stale and empty of life.[%p]
Yesterday, that shocking experiment convinced me that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) was also a time machine.[%p]
But Kurisu didn’t seem willing to accept the results. She just started screaming,[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“A time machine? A time machine!? It can’t be!!”[%p]
Then she took a mad dash out of the lab.[%p]
It was like she couldn’t get out of here fast enough.[%p]
As for Mayuri, she was depressed about her chicken and bananas, so she skipped her daily costume sewing and went home. Grudges over food run deep, I guess.[%p]
Which leaves the lab empty, save for Daru and me.[%p]
Our enthusiasm shot through the roof when we realized that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) had tremendous hidden potential. We nearly died of excitement after successfully sending an email to the past.[%p]
So we stayed up all night doing experiments to confirm whether or not the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is indeed a time machine.[%p]
The results, however...[%p]
We went to the supermarket and stocked up on a wide variety of items. We tossed each of them into the PhoneWave (name subject to change), but everything failed. No change. Nothing happened.[%p]
After the experiment where the discharge phenomenon occurred, everything warmed up normally. No gelification.[%p]
Suddenly, we couldn’t get anything to happen. We still have no idea why.[%p]
First, let’s review the problems revealed by this last run of experiments.[%p]
[margin top="114"]Problem 1.[linebreak][margin top="38"]Electrical discharge safety precautions.[linebreak]We removed everything flammable from the development room to reduce the risk of fire.[linebreak]We also prepared two fire buckets full of water. Just in case.[%e]
But that’s not a fundamental solution.[%p]
We’ll keep an eye out from now on. But if things get dangerous, we should seriously consider relocating our experiments.[%p]
[margin top="114"]Problem 2.[linebreak][margin top="38"]Mass increase.[linebreak]When the discharge phenomenon occurs, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) suddenly gains mass for unknown reasons.[linebreak]Because of this, the microwave broke the table and made a dent in the floor.[%e]
To deal with the issue, we placed the microwave on the floor. We spread cushions and blankets underneath. This hides the hole in the floor, too.[%p]
It’s only a temporary fix, though. If we make any more holes, Mister Braun is quite capable of raising my rent.[%p]
And that’s to say nothing of the calamity it will cause if it falls through the floor.[%p]
Anyway, we need to find the source of the mass increase. If amateurs like us even can, that is.[%p]
But the first two problems pale before the third.[%p]
This last problem is critical. Until we solve it, we can’t even really experiment with the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
[margin top="152"]Problem 3.[linebreak][margin top="38"]We’re not even sure of the necessary conditions to send email to the past.[%e]
No matter how many times we tried, we couldn’t pin down a single condition.[%p]
We spent the entire night doing trial and error. We tried over 40 different things, but not once could we reproduce the discharge phenomenon.[%p]
I had the idea that opening the microwave door was the key. That theory was proven false.[%p]
There might be something else I’m missing, but for now, we’re at a impasse.[%p]
We started off in high spirits, but grew more and more frustrated as time progressed. Which brings us to the present.[%p]
Honestly, I gave up. That’s why I spent the entire morning lazing about like this.[%p]
Another email pops up on my phone.[%p]
I’ve been getting way too many of these since yesterday.[%p]
They’re all from Shining Finger -- the woman called Kiryu Moeka.[%p]
I’ve never used email this often before.[%p]
Even Mayuri only sends me one or two a day, and she’s a teenage girl.[%p]
Frankly, this is starting to get on my nerves.[%p]
I saw how fast Shining Finger typed. That should’ve been enough to tip me off that she was a mail demon. I was careless.[%p]
It’s too much of a pain to reply, so I ignore it.[%p]
I finish off my bottle of Dr P. My stomach gurgles.[%p]
I haven’t eaten anything since yesterday.[%p]
I’m so hungry, I don’t even feel like showering.[%p]
I call out to Daru, who’s hammering on the keyboard.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, wanna go to Sanbo for some beef bowl?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nah, too much trouble...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aren’t you hungry?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah, but...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph. You’re such a bum.”[%p]
What is doing on the computer anyway?[%p]
I’m curious, so I casually peek over his shoulder.[%p]
There’s an image of a futuristic-looking facility I’ve never seen before.[%p]
Richly-colored cords crawl through a gigantic octagonal tunnel, like the interior of a spaceship from a sci-fi movie.[%p]
Based on the height of the people in the picture, the tunnel looks to be more than ten meters tall.[%p]
Incidentally, the people don’t look Japanese.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Haa...”[%p]
Daru sighs heartily.[%p]
I don’t know if the blank look in his eyes is from sleepiness, exhaustion, or if something’s just wrong with him.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The Large Hadron Collider sure is cute...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-what!? What did you just say!?”[%p]
Large Hardon Colliander?[%p]
Is that an incantation?[%p]
No -- a secret technique!?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Large Hadron Collider. You don’t know about it?”[%p]
I grab Daru’s relaxed shoulders and wring them out.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Owowowowowow, what are you doing!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you conscious?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Of course, man.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What is this Large Hadron Collider thing?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You know. It’s what SERN uses to do their experiments. LHC for short.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s seriously moe. Recommended.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re lusting for something that’s not even humanoid?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Of course not. But there’s something about it that gets me excited, you know? It makes me smile, you know? Don’t you feel that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Come to think of it, I remember you said that you found factories and the undersides of highways irresistible or something.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah. Same thing.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where does it end?”[%p]
2D, 3D, and even inanimate objects...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Life’s too short. I don’t want to limit my interests, you know?”[%p]
And yet, you’ll do anything to avoid things that don’t interest you. Hypocrite.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“SERN...”[%p]
That name...[%p]
I’ve seen it somewhere, and recently. Where was it again?[%p]
Oh, of course.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“John Titor!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh yeah. That guy you mentioned earlier. He’s the guy @channel’s going crazy about, isn’t he?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That one might be an impostor. I was talking about the John Titor who appeared ten years ago.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“He appeared ten years ago? The same guy?”[%p]
I had hope that Daru would remember, but no such luck.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, John Titor mentioned SERN.”[%p]
I don’t remember all of it, but there’s one thing I’m sure of.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Titor made a prediction. Namely, that before the year 2034, SERN will develop a time machine!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“A time machine? That’s a timely topic.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But that wasn’t just ten years ago. This new Titor said the same thing.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It doesn’t matter if it was ten years ago or ten seconds ago. That’s not the point, Daru.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This coincidence could very well be the choice of Steins Gate!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Can we trust this Titor guy?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It doesn’t matter if we trust him or not! Now we have something in common -- a time machine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We should investigate SERN! We’ve got nothing to lose!”[%p]
Vigor returns to my body.[%p]
Curiosity truly is the greatest delicacy for a mad scientist like me![%p]
Anyway, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) experiment has hit a dead end for now, so it shouldn’t matter if I make a little detour for this.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Tell me everything you know about SERN.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Sure thing. My SERN folder is smoking hot!”[%p]
Daru strikes his keys with renewed passion.[%p]
He goes to the My Pictures folder and opens a folder literally called SERN.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“SERN is the world’s largest particle physics research institution. It’s popularly called the ’European Laboratory for Particle Physics’, or the ’European Organization for Nuclear Research’.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s close to the border of Switzerland and France, on the outskirts of Geneva. It’s famous as the birthplace of [color index="820000"]HTML[color index="800000"], [color index="820000"]HTTP[color index="800000"], and the [color index="820000"]World Wide Web[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The World Wide Web? You mean the internet?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Bingo. That thing at the beginning of most URLs.”[%p]
SERN invented that?[%p]
All I know about SERN is what I read Titor’s book. I never knew they were that amazing.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Most people aren’t aware, but there’s a Japanese research team working at SERN too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What sort of research does SERN do?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Particle physics, mostly.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“SERN can do experiments no one else can, because they have the biggest particle accelerators in the world.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The Low Energy Antiproton Ring, the Proton Synchrotron Booster, the Large Electron-Positron Collider.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And the big boss is the largest accelerator in the world, the LHC... Large Hadron Collider-tan.”[%p]
...-tan?[%p]
Otaku possess the ability to [color index="820000"]anthropomorphize[color index="800000"] (in moe form) just about anything in the world simply by sticking “tan” on the end of its name. Daru’s powers encompass even particle accelerators.[%p]
Daru doesn’t seem to notice my shock. He just brings up the next image.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The LHC is a 27km-long circular tunnel built underneath SERN’s headquarters.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Its purpose is to smash protons together in the hope of creating unknown elementary particle reactions. They started experimenting last year.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Before they started, there were rumors that the experiments might create mini black holes.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh no! Those mini black holes will swallow the earth! The universe is in danger! etc.”[%p]
Mini black holes...[%p]
I’m pretty sure Titor said his time machine used mini black holes.[%p]
Are the things he said about SERN true?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s the possibility of that actually happening?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“100% that it... won’t. SERN officially denies it.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Let’s say a mini black hole was formed. The amount of energy would be so tiny that it would disappear instantly upon formation. It would be impossible for it to swallow the world.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But where there’s smoke, there’s fire.”[%p]
If I remember correctly, Titor claimed that SERN began time machine research in 2001. In 2034, they complete the time machine.[%p]
Right now, it’s 2010. If they actually started that research, it would have been 9 years ago.[%p]
According to their official announcements, they only began experimenting in 2008. That’s suspicious.[%p]
Of course, that’s assuming Titor’s story is true.[%p]
Some of Titor’s predictions were on the mark, but most weren’t.[%p]
I’m also perplexed by how everyone around me seems to have forgotten about Titor’s 2000 appearance.[%p]
There’s something important in Titor’s tale.[%p]
Or at least, I want there to be.[%p]
I take out my phone and put it to my ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. Hehehe, don’t be surprised. I’ve sniffed out an evil conspiracy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...John Titor. SERN. You see where I’m going with this? ...Yeah, that’s right. They’re likely connected to the Organization.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph, coincidence? Come now, don’t disappoint me. ...What? Evidence? Well, if you must know... whispers. Whispers of my mad scientist intuition.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Those bastards are trying to destroy the world. ...Yeah, with mini black holes. But what if we were to steal that technology? What then?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Heh heh heh. Of course. Who do you think I am? Everything is the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
I put away my phone, then turn to find Daru giving me an exasperated look.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Just who the hell are you fighting with?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, I know what we must do.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whuzzat?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t you ’whuzzat’ me! You’re supposed to grin like you know exactly what I’m talking about! What kind of super hacka are you!?”[%p]
I wanted him to say something like “Well, why the hell not. So, what’s in it for me?”[%p]
And then we’d continue like this, grinning slyly the whole time:[%p]
[margin top="76"][margin left="360"]Me: “A week’s worth of potato chips.”[%e]
[margin top="228"]Daru: “Ten days.”[%e]
[margin top="76"][margin left="400"]Me: “Hmph, you sure are a glutton.”[%e]
[margin top="228"]Daru: “The Dive makes you a hungry man.”[%e]
[margin top="76"][margin left="600"]Me: “Deal. Get started.”[%e]
[margin top="228"]Daru “You got it, boss.”[%e]
Or something like that. Yup, a real cool conversation.[%p]
But the real-world Daru just purses his lips.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You always give such half-baked explanations. Try to sound intelligible before you try to sound intelligent.”[%p]
Work with me here![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You are a super hacka.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Stop saying hacka. At least say hacker.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“See where I’m going with this?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“No, not at all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hack into SERN.”[%p]
Daru stares at me in disbelief.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...Is that some kind of joke?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know you can do it, Daru. Expose their dastardly deeds and find any hints you can about the time machine.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Dastardly deeds? You’re just imagining that stuff, Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We stand at a crossroads. Will the PhoneWave (name subject to change) become a functional time machine, or will it die as garbage in lab storage?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You serious?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m always serious!”[%p]
I look Daru straight in the eye as I answer.[%p]
Looks like that made him understand my position.[%p]
Daru sweeps the garbage off his desk and sits up straight.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m not responsible for the consequences, got it?”[%p]
Suddenly, Daru is bursting with energy. It’s like his earlier lethargy was a lie.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Deal. Get started.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Let’s do this!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“For your payment, I’ll deposit a week’s supply of potato chips into your Swiss bank account.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...”[%p]
Daru doesn’t respond. He’s already deep in concentration.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, I’m gonna sleep. It’s all yours.”[%p]
I lie down on the sofa and let the clacking of Daru’s keyboard lull me to sleep.[%p]
