I wake up to the twilight sun streaming in through the window.[%p]
A refreshing breeze blows in, softly brushing my cheek.[%p]
Daru’s exactly where I left him before I fell asleep. He’s sitting in exactly the same position.[%p]
Not much has changed besides his typing speed.[%p]
Oh, and now he’s muttering to himself.[%p]
I guess he hasn’t had any success at hacking yet.[%p]
I look around the room, but I can’t find Mayuri.[%p]
Maybe she’s not coming today.[%p]
I guess food-related grudges really do run deep.[%p]
I stand up and stretch. I don’t want to bother Daru, so I don’t say anything to him.[%p]
I take a cold Dr P out of the fridge and quench my thirst.[%p]
Then I throw myself back down onto the sofa and start browsing @channel on my phone.[%p]
And what perfect timing! Titor is currently posting in the thread.[%p]
