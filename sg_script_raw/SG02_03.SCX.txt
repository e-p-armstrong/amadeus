[name]???[line]“Anyone home?”[%p]
I’m immersed in a heated internet argument when an unfamiliar voice interrupts me.[%p]
The door opens, and a girl peeks inside.[%p]
I recognize her.[%p]
It’s the girl I met yesterday at the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
[name]Girl[line]“Hi! I’m from the Braun Tube Workshop.”[%p]
When our eyes meet, she smiles.[%p]
[name]Girl[line]“The TV you sent in for repairs has been fixed. Mind picking it up?”[%p]
Daru’s typing gets even faster.[%p]
Looks like he’s in the zone. It would be a bad idea to disturb him with our voices.[%p]
I nod to the girl and hurry outside.[%p]
[name]Girl[line]“Why do we have to be sneaky?”[%p]
Umm, what was this girl’s name again?[%p]
I think it was something like Aruma or Amore.[%p]
...Oh right, Amane. Amane Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Currently, my genius partner in crime is executing an important mission. I don’t want to bother him.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hmmm. What exactly do you guys do?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I told you before that learning our secrets could put you and everyone you know in grave danger.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’re called the Future Gadget Laboratory, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How did you know that!? I never told you. Wait, are you an Organization spy!?”[%p]
I raise my guard and spring into praying mantis stance.[%p]
But Suzuha just stares blankly.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s what it said on your mailbox.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Oh.”[%p]
I lower my guard. Why didn’t she just say so?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“N-now that you know, it’s not like you can un-know. I’ll give you the short explanation. But you must not tell a soul.”[%p]
Suzuha nods firmly.[%p]
Is it just me, or are her eyes gleaming?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We are the Future Gadget Laboratory, dedicated to defeating the evil organization that rules the world from the shadows. Muhahaha!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Wow...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Is the evil organization SERN?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-yeah, but...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh! So I was right? Those guys really are a contemptible lot, aren’t they?”[%p]
She nods to herself for some reason.[%p]
And “contemptible”? I thought I was the only one who uses words like that in normal conversation.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How did you know we were hacking into SERN!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What? You’re hacking them? Right now?”[%p]
Me and my big mouth.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just answer my question! How did you know about our business with SERN!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ah, umm, well...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Weeell, ahahah, actually, I overheard you this afternoon. If you stand here, you can hear stuff from the window.”[%p]
The window...[%p]
Come to think of it, it was open, and Daru and I were talking loudly.[%p]
But can you really hear us from here?[%p]
I look up to the second floor.[%p]
The window’s still fully open, but I can’t hear a thing.[%p]
I guess Daru’s working quietly.[%p]
I look down.[%p]
There’s an unfamiliar bicycle parked in front of the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
One of those mountain bikes. Its frame is all sparkly, its tires mostly clean. It’s probably new.[%p]
It looks pretty fast, but whose is it?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ve only been working here for a day, but...”[%p]
Suzuha opens the Braun Tube Workshop door with a wry smile.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ve got a lot more free time than I expected. I’ve gone out four or five times today. Figured I’d reconnoiter the front of the store, see if I couldn’t spot any customers.”[%p]
Reconnoiter? Now there’s a word you don’t hear in casual conversation.[%p]
I’m pretty sure it means to perform reconnaissance, to scout an area and gather intelligence.[%p]
Is she some kind of secret agent!?[%p]
I follow Suzuha into the store.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So that’s when I heard you guys talking from the second floor.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I got interested and looked it up online. Now I know all the rumors about SERN.”[%p]
Damn. We were careless.[%p]
Looks like we need to close that window when we discuss sensitive matters from now on.[%p]
But if we do that, the lab will turn into a scorching hell.[%p]
Damned if I do, damned if I don’t.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...A-anyway, you must not tell anyone else.”[%p]
Or else men in black will raid us.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ah, yeah. I understand. I’m actually tight lipped, so don’t worry.”[%p]
Suzuha grins and thumps her chest confidently.[%p]
All is quiet inside the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
That gigantic TV isn’t on.[%p]
Mister Braun’s not here either.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where’s the manager?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“He left right after he finished repairing your TV.”[%p]
He probably went to see the chipmunk.[%p]
He disappears during business hours every now and then.[%p]
Whenever I ask him where he’s going, he always says something like “I’m picking my beloved daughter up from school” or “My beloved daughter has a cold” with a huge grin on his face.[%p]
He dotes on her too much. It probably just annoys her. Anyway, just how irresponsible can you be to neglect work to see your daughter?[%p]
He used to put a “Back Soon” sign on the door whenever he left, but now he has Suzuha to take care of things while he’s gone.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Sooo, here’s the fixed TV.”[%p]
Suzuha lightly taps the TV on the counter.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“He said to charge 1000 yen.”[%p]
Damn manager. I bet he gave it to us just so he could charge repair fees.[%p]
I reluctantly take a bill out of my wallet and hand it to Suzuha.[%p]
She takes out a receipt. Apparently, it was already written out.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Thanks for your patronage. Well, just take it away.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By myself? Are you joking?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh? Didn’t you bring it here by yourself?”[%p]
Don’t you know it takes ten times more effort to go up stairs than down? Defying gravity is no easy task, woman![%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I guess I can help, but... oh, I see. So we’re already in the age where women do physical labor.”[%p]
She mutters, her tone pensive.[%p]
Tch. How sarcastic of her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph. I don’t remember anyone asking for your help. Honestly, getting help from a girl like you would just hurt my pride.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Wow!”[%p]
Applause.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That was so manly! I might be falling for you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph, you think you can trick me like that? You’re lying, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Eh? What makes you think that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s one of my powers... Coloring Gentleman.”[%p]
This power allows me to see through lies. Liars appear to glow red. Then they die.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Y-you have powers?”[%p]
Suzuha’s eyes pop, but then she clears her throat as if to hide her surprise.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Are you some kind of esper?”[%p]
When I nod, she whispers into my ear.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Are there a lot of espers like you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course not. I am special!”[%p]
I thrust my chest out as far as possible to display my majesty.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh... You had me scared for a second there. But still, it’s amazing that people like you exist. Maybe SERN is the reason there aren’t more where I came from...”[%p]
After muttering some nonsense to herself, she finally nods in understanding.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“By the way, does the ability to see through lies have any combat application at all?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If it were me, I’d want perfect accuracy within a thousand meters, or ultra-fast reflexes that let me tear my enemy’s limbs off before they can react.”[%p]
What the hell is she talking about? Is she a [color index="820000"]survival game[color index="800000"] otaku?[%p]
No, wait. Don’t tell me![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You... you’re an Organization assassin, aren’t you? You must be the one they call Miss Golgo! Who hired you!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Nobody hired me. What’s a Golgo?”[%p]
She’s trying to gloss things over with an insincere smile.[%p]
Her confusion is suspicious.[%p]
That reminds me. I think I remember her saying some awfully disturbing things when we first met yesterday.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Anyway, do you have any other powers?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Even if I did, there’s no way I’d tell a hitman hired to kill me.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m not going to kill you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Revealing my powers would be suicide. They are most effective with the element of surprise. In other words, they’re for me to know and you to find out!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Meanie.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Say what you like.”[%p]
Burning tension runs between us.[%p]
Our eyes meet. Invisible sparks scatter.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
And then an email arrives to break the stalemate. I turn my attention away from Suzuha.[%p]
This ringtone is starting to piss me off.[%p]
It’s most likely from that mail demon Shining Finger.[%p]
I can tell without even checking.[%p]
Tch, this is getting ridiculous.[%p]
She’s got some stalker qualities, and maybe split personalities.[%p]
I shouldn’t have given her my address.[%p]
I look at Suzuha and see her lying on the counter.[%p]
She’s playing with something in the palm of her hand.[%p]
It looks like a small metal pin.[%p]
Anyway, how can she be this lazy on her second day?[%p]
“I love CRTs” was a lie too, wasn’t it?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Why the frown? Did you get a death notice?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A what?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...J-just wondering.”[%p]
She was just wondering if I got a death notice?[%p]
How can she say that with a straight face?[%p]
And what the hell is a death notice anyway? Do those even exist?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Umm, what I meant to ask was if you got some unpleasant news.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...You could say that.”[%p]
This girl is hard to get a handle on.[%p]
I really shouldn’t let my guard down around her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s this woman who’s obsessed with finding an IBN 5100.”[%p]
Suzuha leaps up as soon as I speak.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“An IBN 5100?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You know about them?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see. So the IBN 5100 legend is famous, huh.”[%p]
Maybe that retro PC’s more popular with female otaku than I thought.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Y-yeah, that’s it. I heard the urban legend from someone. How much do you know about it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I actually tried looking for an IBN 5100, but in the end, I came to the conclusion that there isn’t one in Akiba.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...I see. Well, that’s true.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You sound like you know something.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Eh? Well, I do and I don’t, I guess.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I don’t know about it personally, but I happened to hear about it from a knowledgeable acquaintance of mine or something like that. Aha, ahaha.”[%p]
Another insincere smile.[%p]
I’m starting to think she’s not a very good liar.[%p]
You can tell she’s lying whenever she smiles like that.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Sure enough, she doesn’t offer any other information. She just keeps that insincere smile plastered on her face.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who [color index="A0140000"]are[color index="800000"] you?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Haaahh...”[%p]
Suzuha falls back down onto the counter with a deep sigh.[%p]
She looks up at me from that position.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I was thinking of giving you a bunch of interesting information on the IBN 5100...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But when you look at me like that, I don’t feel like it anymore.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not even interested in the IBN 5100.”[%p]
I’m more concerned with SERN right now.[%p]
Solving one of Akiba’s mysteries won’t topple the Organization’s regime, after all.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You don’t have a shred of credibility. I have no way of knowing if that ’interesting information’ of yours is true or not.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Wow, that’s harsh! Well, I admit I am acting kinda suspicious.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I won’t tell you, but I’ll give you a hint.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And then you’ll writhe in agony when you can’t figure it out!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Truth is, the IBN 5100 has a hidden function.”[%p]
A hidden function...[%p]
That reminds me. I’m pretty sure the John Titor from 2000 said something like that.[%p]
I search through my memories.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If I remember correctly, the IBN 5100 can do something or other with a proprietary programming language.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No way! How did you know!? Tell me, tell me!”[%p]
I only vaguely remembered, but it looks like I hit the mark.[%p]
I grin.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s another one of my powers -- Leading Question. I can read your heart of hearts.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What!? No fair!”[%p]
For some reason, Suzuha covers her face with both her hands.[%p]
She opens her fingers just enough to peek at me.[%p]
That’s not enough to escape my power. [%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see everything, Amane Suzuha! Resistance is futile.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Kuh!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Anyway, the IBN 5100 has a hidden function!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It can decipher IBN’s proprietary programming language, which was written before [color index="820000"]APL[color index="800000"] and [color index="820000"]BASIC[color index="800000"] became widespread. Isn’t that surprising?”[%p]
Now I remember. John Titor said the same thing in 2000. And right after that, an IBN engineer officially admitted to that function’s existence.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Now it’s a dead programming language that can only be deciphered with an IBN 5100.”[%p]
The reason Titor traveled to 1975 to obtain an IBN 5100 was because he needed that function.[%p]
Maybe Moeka wants to use it too.[%p]
Or maybe not. Shining Finger doesn’t seem like the type who’d know about that sort of function.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s why IBN 5100s are so rare.”[%p]
While talking, Suzuha keeps dropping her glance to the metal pin in her hand.[%p]
She rolls it around with her fingers.[%p]
I guess that’s a habit of hers.[%p]
So IBN 5100s are super rare? Maybe if I get one, I could sell it for a high price.[%p]
That could be a good way to raise research funds.[%p]
But first, I have to deal with SERN.[%p]
