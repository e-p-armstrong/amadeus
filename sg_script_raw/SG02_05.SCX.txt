[name]Itaru[line]“...”[%p]
Twenty hours have passed since Daru started hacking.[%p]
Night gives way to a refreshing summer morning.[%p]
I glance at Daru while browsing @channel on my phone.[%p]
He’s fidgeting even more. Now his legs are like pistons.[%p]
His knees move up and down in harmony with the rattatattat of his keyboard.[%p]
Daru hasn’t slept in about 40 hours, but he still won’t get off the computer.[%p]
I was going to ask him if he’d like a break, but his entire body is exuding an aura that says “Don’t talk to me.”[%p]
I curl up a bit and return to my phone.[%p]
My discussions with John Titor just aren’t making sense.[%p]
Not even Titor himself seems to know about the Titor from ten years ago.[%p]
It’s hard to imagine that everyone on @channel is conspiring against me.[%p]
But how else can I explain it?[%p]
Out of options, I decide to email Titor directly, just as he told me to. He audaciously exposed his own address on @channel. I guess that’s his way of saying “Bring it on!”[%p]
In my email, I question the differences between his posts now and his posts ten years ago.[%p]
The current Titor hasn’t even acknowledged the latter.[%p]
I only vaguely remember them, but they basically went like this:[%p]
- In 2015, World War III breaks out. Many people die.[%p]
- By 2036, the world is a nuclear wasteland.[%p]
- John Titor travels to 1975 to obtain an IBN 5100. The IBN 5100 was necessary to revive technology lost in World War III.[%p]
- The IBN 5100 has a hidden function: the ability to read IBN’s proprietary computer language which predates APL and BASIC.[%p]
- But only certain IBN engineers are aware of that function, so it does not appear in the manual.[%p]
- In 1998, Titor meets his younger self and his parents in America.[%p]
- John Titor was a soldier who volunteered for this mission.[%p]
- John Titor is an American.[%p]
Furthermore, in 2000, Titor correctly predicted the outcomes of some future events.[%p]
The Peruvian coast earthquake in 2001, the election of a new pope, the outbreak of the Iraq War, China’s advances in space, and so forth.[%p]
Though he only talked vaguely about each one, they all came true.[%p]
On the other hand, other predictions went unfulfilled.[%p]
For example, the [color index="820000"]Y2K bug[color index="800000"], civil war in America, the cancellation of the Beijing Olympics, the inauguration of America’s first female president in 2009, and so forth.[%p]
There’s more, but let’s leave those aside for now.[%p]
I’m going to ask him why those predictions didn’t come true.[%p]
Alright, let’s send it now.[%p]
If he can’t answer to my satisfaction, then the current Titor is an impostor.[%p]
This is your litmus test, John Titor.[%p]
Heh heh heh. So, what are your true colors?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪ Good morning!”[%p]
Mayuri comes in.[%p]
Looks like she’s forgiven us for experimenting on her food. She’s back to her usual smiley self.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing here so early?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Well, I heard you guys had stayed up two nights in a row, so I brought you some goodies.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Excellent. Good job.”[%p]
Though, to be accurate, it wasn’t two nights in a row. I took an afternoon nap yesterday.[%p]
Mayuri starts fishing through her convenience store bag.[%p]
And then she takes out...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tada! [color index="820000"]Canned oden[color index="800000"]!”[%p]
The canned oden is still warm when she gives it to me.[%p]
I open the lid right away and eat the beef.[%p]
Mayuri and I have been together for a long time, so she knows what I like.[%p]
And when it comes to canned oden, beef is where it’s at.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s a present from Mayushii. They’re 270 yen each, so savor it, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve been getting tired of eating bananas and chicken lately. Buy these instead from now on.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But Mayushii doesn’t have enough pocket money to splurge like this all the time.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And Mayushii loves bananas and chicken, so she’ll keep buying them.”[%p]
Mmgh.[%p]
I consider saying “You’ll get fat if you only eat frozen foods,” but that threat’s not very effective against Mayuri, so I hold my tongue.[%p]
Her high metabolism prevents her from getting fat, no matter how much she eats.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But wait, there’s more. Tada♪”[%p]
Next, she produces a small box with a RaiNet illustration.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“RaiNet sausage! It comes with an Upa bottle cap as a bonus! I really wanted it, so I bought it.”[%p]
She sticks out her tongue with a shy giggle.[%p]
Something tells me that in a few months’ time, this lab will be neck-deep in Upa goods.[%p]
There are only a few things right now, like the cushion on the sofa, but that number is sure to grow exponentially.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So how’s Daru-kun?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“He’s in the midst of a hard fight. He should at least rest a little. I mean, I never said he had to do it all at once.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Daru-kun’s super hacka spirit is on fire!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Don’t say hacka!”[%p]
An empty diet cola bottle comes whistling through the air.[%p]
It hits my head with a nice thunk.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“He sure is tense...”[%p]
Mayuri and I evacuate to a corner of the lounge and quietly eat the oden.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But, isn’t hacking bad? Mayushii doesn’t want you to do bad things...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I would be a fool to let Daru’s super hacka... I mean, hacker skills go to waste.”[%p]
Incidentally, it looks like hackers hijacked SERN’s system back in 2008. We found news articles about it online.[%p]
That means even the inventors of the world wide web have holes in their security.[%p]
With his skills, Daru should have no trouble getting through.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Besides, we’re doing this to expose SERN’s wrongdoings. This is a war against the dark forces that secretly rule the world!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Bad things are bad.”[%p]
Mm? That’s unusual. Mayuri usually just accepts whatever I say.[%p]
Well, I admit it. We are doing a bad thing.[%p]
But there’s no way we can stop now.[%p]
I need to change the subject.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, want to trade my sweet potatoes for your beef?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehh? If you want to trade, I’d rather have your quail egg.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t be ridiculous! Next to beef, quail eggs are my favorite.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But Mayushii likes quail eggs too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Settle for my chikuwa.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mm... okay. Chikuwa’s better than sweet potatoes.”[%p]
With that said, I skewer the chikuwa and put it in Mayuri’s can.[%p]
And I get her beef in return.[%p]
Subject change complete. Mayuri really eats up conversations about food. It’s so easy to manipulate her. Muhahaha![%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Soon... If I can just get the SQL table, I’ll have more than enough passwords... geheheh... you’re no match for me...”[%p]
Daru has started talking to himself.[%p]
Looks like things are falling into place.[%p]
Daru really is a super hacka.[%p]
I think this is the first time I’ve seen him serious.[%p]
Daru bends himself forward, staring holes into the screen.[%p]
But all I see on the screen is the same string of numbers and letters...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oho! Comeoncomeoncomeon, mmyes, mmyes, hooah! You can’t hide from me, you naughty thing you! How does it feel to be naked? Hyahaaa! Hahaha!”[%p]
His eyes are bloodshot, and he’s started rambling.[%p]
Maybe the lack of sleep is getting to him.[%p]
Daru opens up a new window, types in a 12 character string, and slams the enter key.[%p]
An error sound rings.[%p]
He quickly deletes the string and enters in a new one.[%p]
He keeps repeating that sequence, until finally...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh yes! YESSSSSSS! Matching ID and password! Login complete, hell yeah! Taste it! YESYESYES!”[%p]
W-what enthusiasm...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you get it!?”[%p]
The smug bastard turns around with an expression of immense satisfaction.[%p]
As if he’s gone into [color index="820000"]la petite mort[color index="800000"].[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Mission complete.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Really!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow, that’s amazing! I don’t really get it, though.”[%p]
After 20 hours of agony, it’s finally over.[%p]
To show Daru my appreciation, I toss him an unopened oden can.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“An oden can’s the best after a job well done.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well done! You really are the world’s greatest super hacka!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hacker.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“H-hacker! I’m glad you’re on my side.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, did you find out how they’re planning to destroy the world?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I haven’t looked yet, man. All I did was get us connected.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But it’s all downhill from here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry if you’re tired, but please start checking. The keys to this conspiracy have got to be in there.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah, yeah, I’ll do it. But let me eat this oden can first.”[%p]
After a short meal break, Daru taps on his keyboard more nimbly than before.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The question is who this password belongs to.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Why is that?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I went into SERN’s database and got a data table. From there, I focused on people with simple passwords like “11111111” and “ABCDEFGH” to get my hands on an ID.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’d be awesome if this turns out to be the server admin’s logon, but I don’t think we’re that lucky.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“In Japanese please?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Same.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Basically, if this is the server admin’s password, we can taste every inch of SERN’s luscious, luscious flesh. But if it’s just an ordinary researcher’s password, then we can only see SERN’s boobs.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Daru-kun, that’s naughty!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Quit the erotic examples. Basically, you mean there’ll be limits to what information we can access.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Exactly.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Anyway, it’s only a matter of time before I get a server admin’s password. Let’s save that for later. I’m really sleepy now.”[%p]
It would be cruel to push Daru any further.[%p]
It’s unfortunate, but overworking him isn’t an option. Let’s let him rest so he can regain his energy.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh! Looks like our ID belongs to an accelerator division chief.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So it’s not a server admin...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It would take a miracle to get one on our first try. How many staff members do you think SERN has?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“How many?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Over 6000.”[%p]
That many?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, for now, let’s look at this accelerator division chief. Uh, his name is...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Jack. Let’s look at his email log.”[%p]
And of course, the emails come up in English.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh no... that makes Mayushii’s head hurt...”[%p]
Hmph. It’s pathetic to flinch at the mere sight of English.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, what does that say?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Need to translate it...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is a job for [color index="820000"]Dr.Excite[color index="800000"]!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nah. I’ve got a better idea.”[%p]
Daru boots up translation software and auto-translates the open page.[%p]
Poor, unnatural Japanese shows up.[%p]
The first line says “HAPPY NEW YEAR”.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Looks like a new year’s greeting. Something about going on vacation in Spain... lucky bastard.”[%p]
That email’s normal. Nothing out of the ordinary.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“If we keep scouring the log like this, we can also identify the server manager.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You know, looking through someone else’s email without permission makes me feel really guilty...”[%p]
Mayuri gets depressed and moves away from the computer.[%p]
She sits on the sofa and hugs her giant Upa cushion with a sigh.[%p]
I know we’re doing something socially unacceptable. However...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I abandoned guilt when I chose the path of Evil long ago! Muhahaha!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let the responsibility be mine. I will not ask you to answer for my crimes.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What a guy! I’d let Okarin do me in the butt.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I decline your offer.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now get peeking, Daru!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin, you’re bad... You make Mayushii sad.”[%p]
That’s of no concern to me.[%p]
You just sit there and pretend your hands are clean.[%p]
Upon further examination, we discover several emails with the title “Experiment report”.[%p]
In English, naturally.[%p]
Looks like he sends emails like these almost daily.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“LHC experiment reports? There could be a hint about time machines in there. We should try reading them.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“This is definitely a crime, though...”[%p]
That’s what his lips say, but his hand still clicks on the email.[%p]
What comes up is an unintelligible series of symbols.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“This is encrypted.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Tch, of course it isn’t that simple...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]”Well, cracking this should be a piece of cake.” [%p]
Nice, super hacka.[%p]
He’s a genius, no doubt.[%p]
Daru undoes the security in less than ten minutes.[%p]
The real timesink is deciphering the crappy machine translation.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Umm, translated into proper Japanese, it’s...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“’Hi, Pole!’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That acting’s completely unnecessary.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Aw...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“’Uploaded today’s data to the server. The LHC is performing admirably. Can’t say the same about the rest, though.’”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“’This baby’s fickle as a cat, but it was surprisingly obedient this month. It would be great if it stayed like this forever.’”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“’But don’t you think this work is unrewarding? This kitten -- this 27-kilometer long kitten, HAHAHAHA -- has been in operation for nine years.’”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“’Our research will change the course of history, yet only a small group of people are allowed to see it.’”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“’Of course, if it were ever officially released, it would be one hell of a scandal.’”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“’People would probably say something like, ’Call Robert Zemeckiff to SERN right away. He could build it in less than a year.’’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Nine years?”[%p]
Daru finishes reading. I rub my temples with my thumbs.[%p]
Calm down. Let’s sort things out.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you think there were any translation errors in that email?”[%p]
Did Daru notice something unnatural too? He’s not joking like he usually does.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“If you trust the translation software, then that’s what it says. The Japanese is strange in places, though.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But that doesn’t make sense.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I thought the LHC was only put into operation around spring last year. But this email makes it sound like it’s been in operation for nine years.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That is strange.”[%p]
The email’s send date is this year, 2010. So nine years ago makes it 2001.[%p]
John Titor posted this on @channel yesterday:[%p]
“The only other thing I can say is that you must not believe their lies.”[%p]
“They have already succeeded at creating micro black holes.”[%p]
I gulp.[%p]
If you read between the lines of this email... it sounds like they’re doing some sort of secret experiment.[%p]
Also, Robert Zemeckiff is a super-famous Hollywood movie director.[%p]
He directed a trilogy of smash-hit time travel movies about twenty years ago.[%p]
I groan.[%p]
No way... was I right?[%p]
SERN’s hiding a major secret from the world?[%p]
And it’s related to time travel?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Keep looking, Daru. Search for anything related to time machine research.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Seriously?”[%p]
I don’t know if Daru is questioning my order or the possibility that SERN might be researching time travel.[%p]
Either way, he begins tapping on the keyboard again.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm, there aren’t any emails with the phrase ’time machine’ in them...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But the phrase ’Z Program’ was used hundreds of times in the past few months.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Do you think it could be about the current LHC experiments?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What is it specifically? Black hole formation experiments?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmmm, let’s try looking for a document... ah, found one.”[%p]
Daru opens a PDF attachment.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oho! Looks like this is top secret stuff from France, England, and Holland.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Government secrets?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“SERN’s not even a government organization, so why?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, should we be looking at this stuff? We might be in a little deep here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t care. Get me details.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hold on. If we get caught, we’re not getting off with an apology.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you so incompetent as to let yourself be traced?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...I took the necessary precautions.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then I fail to see the problem.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, thanks.”[%p]
Daru makes a slightly awkward face as he takes the file about the Z Program and feeds it into the translation software.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm... ’May 14th, 137th Z Program Experiment Report’...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“’Because we have already succeeded at creating mini black holes, the report is omitted. First--’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stop! Stooopp!”[%p]
All of a sudden, Titor’s prediction became a reality![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So SERN did use the LHC to generate mini black holes!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But they announced that their experiments still haven’t succeeded, so why...”[%p]
This is what Titor was referring to when he posted “don’t believe what they say.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But the goal of the experiment wasn’t even to generate mini black holes. It was to create new elementary particle reactions...”[%p]
Daru doesn’t take his wide eyes off the monitor.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But in reality, they’re already generating those mini black holes.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Sure does seem like it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What does it say next?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Umm...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“’Results: Error. Human is dead, mismatch. For details, consult Jellyman’s Report No.14.’”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“’We propose that further experiments be halted until the lifter is perfected and all local field conformity points are online.’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wh-what does that mean?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“’Human is dead’ means somebody died, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...”[%p]
Somebody died?[%p]
Seriously?[%p]
I groan.[%p]
This isn’t a joke anymore.[%p]
Something very serious is going on here.[%p]
Maybe we are in too deep.[%p]
Hmph. And what if we are?[%p]
I’m not afraid. I’m not! After all, I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma![%p]
We can’t stop now.[%p]
I can’t control my curiosity. Besides, now that I have proof of their evil deeds, ignoring it would just leave a bad taste in my mouth.[%p]
My throat’s gone dry.[%p]
I swallow my saliva.[%p]
In an attempt to keep whatever composure I can, I scold myself for being so faint of heart.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What is this Jellyman’s Report?”[%p]
Daru starts typing once I ask my question, but he soon clicks his tongue.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I can’t find it in Jack’s email. We’ll need an account with more privileges.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then we’ll save that for next time. Search for something related to time machines.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You know we’re not going to find anything, right?”[%p]
After that, Daru spends about 15 minutes fishing through the accelerator division chief’s email. But he doesn’t find anything about time machines.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Words like ’accelerator technical committee,’ and ’LHC project lead’ came up, so I guess we should look for an ID from there. Maybe then we can get more information.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can’t look it up with the ID you have?”[%p]
Daru shakes his head.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, I guess let’s call it a day.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“By the way, what we just saw was SERN’s biggest server, but I also found a strange database on the network.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Strange how?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It was buggy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Buggy?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I mean, it was full of some kind of code...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But the code was gibberish. Utterly impossible to decode, thank you very much.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Could it be encrypted?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Not by any algorithm I’ve ever seen. It wouldn’t even work as a program. It just bothers me. Why would they have a database that nobody could ever use?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That is strange.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ll see what I can find out.”[%p]
