Daru tries every trick in the book to crack that mystery database.[%p]
But after about an hour, the pistons he has for fingers begin speeding up. Eventually, he just slams the keyboard out of frustration.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Agh! I don’t get it! I don’t get it at all!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You call this a program, dumbass!? Go to hell!”[%p]
Oh great, he snapped...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I think you should stop...”[%p]
Mayuri puts down her sewing tools and turns to Daru with a worried look on her face.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“My head is spinning... I can’t take it any more... fweh, fweheh...”[%p]
This is bad. Daru’s breaking down.[%p]
Maybe I’m pushing him too far.[%p]
He’s been up two days straight. He’s probably at his limit.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Good work. Go rest, Daru.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah... I’ll do that.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Anyway, even if it isn’t a bug, but an actual program, only the guys who made it could understand it.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ve never seen anything like it...”[%p]
A program unlike anything he’s seen... hmm.[%p]
At that moment, music bursts from my pocket.[%p]
I’ve got mail.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
It’s from John Titor.[%p]
Did he reply to the email I sent him earlier?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I gulp.[%p]
A flash runs through my head like an electric shock.[%p]
There’s quite a bit of text, but what catches my eye are the first several lines.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh... of course. Everything is falling into place.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Whatcha talking about?”[%p]
Mayuri looks at me curiously, but I don’t have time to answer her.[%p]
I’m frantically assembling the pieces in my mind.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“John Titor... SERN... the time machine...”[%p]
These things are all connected.[%p]
And now, I have another piece of the puzzle.[%p]
I shiver at my own brilliance.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, I think I know how we can read that program.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Seriously? How?”[%p]
I aim my phone’s camera at the screen displaying the supposedly bugged data and take a picture.[%p]
I attach it to a message -- “Does this code look familiar?” -- and send it to Titor.[%p]
A mysterious database inside SERN. A program unlike anything Super Hacka Daru has ever seen. Its true form is...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If my hunch is correct, John Titor should know!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What? There’s no way!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Say what you like. We’ll know soon enough.”[%p]
We wait for Titor’s reply.[%p]
Though it’s only been a few minutes, it feels like an eternity to me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s here!”[%p]
I quickly open the mail.[%p]
And its contents are enough to raise goosebumps on my entire body.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh, heh heh heh... Just as I suspected.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I was right, Daru.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know where that data comes from.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“An IBN 5100!”[%p]
That retro PC has a certain special function. In fact, for more than 25 years after it went to market in 1975, nobody knew of it save a few IBN engineers.[%p]
That function was first brought to light by the John Titor who appeared in 2000.[%p]
A while after Titor posted about it, an actual IBN engineer admitted to the hidden function’s existence.[%p]
Which reminds me, I talked to Suzuha about this only yesterday.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It can also decipher IBN’s proprietary programming language, which was written before APL and BASIC became widespread. Isn’t that surprising?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Now it’s a dead programming language only decipherable with an IBN 5100.”[%p]
What an incredible coincidence.[%p]
A prime example of [color index="820000"]synchronicity[color index="800000"] at work.[%p]
It’s almost like an almighty will is pulling the strings.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh. No... NO, I SAY! This discovery of ours was inevitable from the start! For this is the choice of Steins Gate!!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, so SERN has an IBN 5100 database? Those machines aren’t compatible with any modern software. Why would they do something like that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Answer me this. What is the best way to secure a machine against external [color index="820000"]cracking[color index="800000"]?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, make it [color index="820000"]standalone[color index="800000"], of course.”[%p]
Daru quickly catches onto the intent of my question.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“If only IBN 5100s can read it, then I guess that’s kind of standalone...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Which means that SERN’s keeping their most important secrets hidden there!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“How do you know about that hidden function anyway?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It is recorded in my brain’s extensive Index Librorum Prohibitorum.”[%p]
Titor said it himself ten years ago. But Daru wouldn’t believe me even if I told him the truth.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Very original.”[%p]
I ignore Daru’s retort.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri! We have important matters to discuss. Assemble!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hm? I can hear you fine from here.”[%p]
Mayuri’s sewing. She doesn’t get off the sofa.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It doesn’t matter whether you can hear or not!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This meeting concerns the fate of the Future Gadget Laboratory -- nay, the fate of mankind!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So I want it to feel more secretive, like we’re scheming or something!”[%p]
It’s important that we stare closely at the monitor and exchange dramatic lines. The atmosphere right now is too... light.[%p]
It’s all Mayuri’s fault.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii won’t participate in your evil schemes.”[%p]
Well, I can’t have everything my way.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Listen, you two! Henceforth, the Future Gadget Laboratory shall begin emergency top secret operations!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This shall be the first stage in our war against the dark powers that manipulate the world from the shadows! Our enemy is SERN, a scientific institute engaged in the most evil research imaginable!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin, you’re too loud... and I’ve been up all night.”[%p]
Crap, I guess I am being too loud.[%p]
That kind of ruins the whole secret feeling.[%p]
And the window’s open, too. If Suzuha is down below, I’m sure she can hear everything.[%p]
So I turn it down a notch.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Understand? The world has no need for two mad scientists. Before they can get ahead of us, we must outwit them!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Who are they?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You know... [color index="A0140000"]them[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Mayushii doesn’t get it at all...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Basically, we must obtain the phantom retro PC... the IBN 5100, said to be located somewhere in Akiba.”[%p]
I make a magnificent declaration, but Daru just rubs his eyes, and Mayuri returns to her needlework.[%p]
Dammit, is there anything you guys react to!?[%p]
We’ve uncovered a massive conspiracy here![%p]
How come you aren’t excited!?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ll pass on the search. I’m seriously tired. Besides, I want to keep combing SERN’s server.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s true...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, you’re the only one who can do that, Daru, so I’ll leave it to you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, the IBN 5100 investigation squad shall consist of Mayuri and me--”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I can’t...”[%p]
Mayuri makes an apologetic face.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I have to make costumes, and I have work, too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
So basically, you two are telling me this:[%p]
I’m the only one with free time.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Fine. I’ll manage alone somehow. It’s useless to try and stop me. Understood?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Are you going to do something bad again?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nah, he’s all talk.”[%p]
I leave my useless comrades behind and stride gallantly out of the lab.[%p]
