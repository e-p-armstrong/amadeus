I step out onto the street.[%p]
Immediately, a bicycle skids to a stop in front of me.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hiya, Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
Suzuha gets off her bicycle and gives me a strange greeting. I want to ask her, “Are you an American or something?” but I’m distracted by her shiny bicycle.[%p]
It’s the same bicycle that was in front of the Braun Tube Workshop yesterday. I guess it belongs to her.[%p]
I wonder how much that set her back. I mean, it does look pretty expensive.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Pretty nice technique there.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Bicycles are fun, aren’t they? I’d never ridden one before coming here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’d never ridden a bicycle!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Nope. I had ridden motorcycles before, though.”[%p]
Isn’t that backwards?[%p]
Weird girl.[%p]
And what’s with that flashy braking back there? I think it’d be pretty dangerous if she did that all through the town. Beginners get cocky and get into accidents. You see that pattern all the time.[%p]
If you’re going to go full speed, at least wear a helmet.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Going to work now?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yup.”[%p]
The Braun Tube Workshop’s shutters are open, but the shop itself never opens until around 11 or 12. I don’t know exactly when. It seems to change with Mr.Braun’s mood.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s perfect. There’s something we need to talk about.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ehh? But I need to get the shop ready for business.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just what does this crumbly old Braun Tube Workshop need to get ’ready’?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Nothing, really. Geez. I just mindlessly sweep in front of the shop. If I clean inside, the boss gets angry. ’Everything’s where it needs to be,’ he says.”[%p]
So he’s paying her to [color index="A0140000"]not[color index="800000"] clean?[%p]
Something’s wrong with that guy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So hear me out, then.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But I’m so tired.”[%p]
In other words, she doesn’t feel like talking.[%p]
I glare at her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You would be... unwise to anger me.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Does it have to be right now?”[%p]
My glare is not very effective. She doesn’t falter at all.[%p]
But I still maintain my stern expression and nod.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Then go ahead.”[%p]
Suzuha shrugs her shoulders as she locks her bicycle. Then she turns to me.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But keep it short, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where is the IBN 5100?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No intel yet.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I don’t know.”[%p]
Oh.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But by the way you talked yesterday, it sure sounded like you knew.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No, I know someone who knows.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then take me to them. I won’t take no for an answer. Refuse, and I’ll show you a living hell.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I can’t.”[%p]
Come on! I even said I’d show you a living hell![%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I can’t introduce you even if I wanted to.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean? Don’t tell me they’re an imaginary--”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“They’ve been dead for years.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Nah, it’s okay. Anyway, there’s nothing I can tell you. Honestly, I’m hoping you can tell me something.”[%p]
Suzuha pats me on the shoulders. Funny. You’d think I’m the one who’s supposed to cheer her up.[%p]
Just then, Mr.Braun opens the door and makes his appearance.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Hey, part-timer! It’s only your third day and you’re late!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Sorry, boss! The streets were a little crowded this morning.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“If you’re not gonna take this seriously, I can always give you the boot, hear?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“As for you, Okabe, don’t you lay a finger on my part-timer.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aren’t you the lecherous one here, Mister Braun?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Why you. Just try saying something like that in front of Nae. I’ll murder ya. Gotta keep my honor as a father.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Besides, I ain’t got no use for a skinny kid like her.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What was that!? Take that back, boss!”[%p]
Suzuha’s actually mad now.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“What, you mad?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m not a kid! I’m a warrior!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Hah? What’re you talking about?”[%p]
Suzuha’s burning passion has the manager shocked. I, on the other hand, am impressed.[%p]
On impulse, I take Suzuha’s hand and grasp it firmly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I like the look in your eyes, you Part-Time Warrior. They shine with the radiance of the beast unseen in modern men.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Never forget those eyes of yours, and you shall surely change class from Part-Time Warrior... to True Warrior.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But I’m already a warrior!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stay diligent in your training, and you shall have a place at my side on the field of [color index="820000"]Ragnarok[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ragnarok?”[%p]
Suzuha looks confused.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What’s that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The final battle against SERN.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’ve got something like that planned? Count me in if you do, but I’ve never heard of it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course you haven’t. This is the first time I’ve revealed it. For I shall be the one to initiate Ragnarok! And the world shall be reborn!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Wow! You sure are brave, Okabe Rintaro. You’ll probably fail, but I like your spirit.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I wish my comrades were as spirited as you are.”[%p]
Apparently, Suzuha has comrades.[%p]
I’d like her to introduce me.[%p]
That way, I can form my personal army, the Phoenix Crusaders.[%p]
...Wait a sec.[%p]
Why does she assume I’ll fail at Ragnarok?[%p]
Looks like I need to instill the fear of Hououin Kyouma into this girl.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Why does my store attract nothing but weirdos? Damn.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Whatever, part-timer. Just come inside.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Coming!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Later, Okabe Rintaro!”[%p]
Suzuha waves and winks at me as she heads inside the store.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wait up, Okarin!”[%p]
Then Mayuri comes down the stairs, passing Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So you’re going to help me search after all? That’s the lab mem spirit.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, no, that’s not it. I was thinking about buying lunch.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
She really is a glutton. It’s not even lunchtime yet.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, where do you plan to go?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hmmm, what to eat...”[%p]
Mayuri places her finger on her bottom lip in thought as she walks.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Sanbo’s beef bowl sounds good!”[%p]
This tiny high school girl truly has guts to enter Sanbo alone.[%p]
That place isn’t like the chain restaurants with their colorful menus and brightly-lit interiors. First timers are often cowed by the old-school atmosphere.[%p]
Plus, the clientele is almost exclusively male. But Mayuri doesn’t care. She just sits there, shoulder to shoulder with students and salarymen, smiling as she eats her beef bowl.[%p]
Meanwhile, the Sanbists -- regular Sanbo customers -- are posting comments online like “The Goddess has arrived!” or “Goddess for the win!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But Sanbo isn’t open this earl--”[%p]
I try to warn her, but Mayuri is no longer there.[%p]
She’s gone.[%p]
Mayuri disappears like this every so often.[%p]
And each time she does, I wonder for one terrible second if she really has vanished from the world.[%p]
I look around and see Mayuri standing at a distance.[%p]
She’s gazing up at the sky through the buildings.[%p]
...Here we go again.[%p]
She’s stopped in the middle of the street, so other pedestrians look at her, wondering what she’s doing.[%p]
But she doesn’t notice their stares. She slowly reaches out to the sky, as if entranced.[%p]
And then she freezes in that position.[%p]
This is one of Mayuri’s habits.[%p]
I call it Stardust Handshake.[%p]
Mayuri says that she’s liked looking at the night sky ever since she was little.[%p]
Her reason is romantic -- or perhaps childish.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I feel like I can reach the stars.”[%p]
When I asked her about it one day, she just smiled and gave that answer.[%p]
At first she only reached out to the night sky, but lately, she’s been doing it without regard to the time of day.[%p]
Like now. Even when she’s walking and talking with someone, something inside her just seems to switch on. Honestly, it’s a little crazy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s too early for stars, Mayuri.”[%p]
I walk up to Mayuri and call out to her. She slowly lowers her hand with a blank smile on her face.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Did you know? Even during the day, the stars are still up there.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Getting philosophical is nice and all, but it’s dangerous to stop in the middle of the street.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe! That’s true.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, just now, when I was looking at the stars, I decided to have ramen for lunch today!”[%p]
How are ramen and stars even related? Mayuri’s mind works in mysterious ways.[%p]
