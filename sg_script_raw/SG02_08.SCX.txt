I know I said I’d search for the IBN 5100, but I have no idea where to start.[%p]
I spent about an hour in an internet cafe searching for information, but turned up nothing.[%p]
I buy some mango juice with tapioca from a juice stand inside Yodobashi. I lose myself in thought as I drink it.[%p]
It’s Saturday, so it’s starting to get crowded in front of the station.[%p]
Some maids are distributing leaflets to the people coming out.[%p]
I know Daru’s well-acquainted with retro PCs, but is there anyone else?[%p]
Oh yeah, Shining Finger was obsessed with the IBN 5100, wasn’t she?[%p]
I’m really reluctant to contact that mail demon, though...[%p]
But ultimately, my feelings are trivial. Ragnarok hangs in the balance.[%p]
I don’t know Shining Finger’s phone number, so I’ll just send her an email for the time being.[%p]
Once I finish drinking my juice, I aimlessly head towards Chuo-dori.[%p]
And then comes an email.[%p]
It’s from Shining Finger.[%p]
That’s a quick reply.[%p]
But I asked her to call, so why did she reply by email?[%p]
But I decide not to bother.[%p]
I finish my drink and wander towards Chuo-dori.[%p]
Then comes an email, almost as if on cue.[%p]
Don’t tell me... is it the mail demon?[%p]
Tch, it’s like she can read my mind.[%p]
I instinctively scan the area, searching for that gloomy woman in the crowd.[%p]
No sign of her tailing me.[%p]
Oh well. I guess I’ll send her a reply.[%p]
I don’t know Shining Finger’s phone number, so I’ll just send her an email for the time being.[%p]
In the email, I ask her to call, and include my phone number.[%p]
Now I just have to wait for her response.[%p]
And there it is.[%p]
That’s a quick reply.[%p]
But I asked her to call, so why did she reply by email?[%p]
Wait, she wants it by email?[%p]
There’s a lot to cover. I’d rather not have to type it all out.[%p]
I need to find out her phone number.[%p]
“Give me your phone number, along with any information you have on the IBN 5100.”[%p]
And... send.[%p]
I look up after finishing my email and see a huge crowd of people in front of Radi-Kan.[%p]
I guess the satellite is still a big deal. The media presence hasn’t died down since the day of the crash either.[%p]
Radi-Kan is still closed.[%p]
And, of course, the satellite is still there.[%p]
Not 30 seconds pass before I get a reply.[%p]
Right as I’m about to look down and read the email, I catch sight of a familiar face in the crowd.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ah.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, if it isn’t my assistant. What are you doing here?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey. When did I become your assistant?”[%p]
She looks like she’ll snap at me, so to dampen her spirit, I go back to checking my email.[%p]
What is wrong with this woman!?[%p]
I told her to tell me her phone number and she just ignored me![%p]
And she doesn’t even have any information! How useless can you be!?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Why are you glaring at me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry about it. You’re not the cause of my frustration.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh, so you’re just raging? Don’t glare at me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’ve glared at me before, haven’t you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s because you keep doing pervy--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ah, no, I’m not saying anything.”[%p]
Another one?[%p]
I want to snap my phone in half and throw it on the ground.[%p]
What do you mean “Tell me the super hacka’s address♪”!? You making fun of me with that “♪”? You’re not getting anything from me![%p]
Anyway, why does she need to send me two short consecutive emails?[%p]
I mean, she might as well just combine them into one.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are the emails you’re getting really that unpleasant?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They’re more... unreasonable than unpleasant.”[%p]
I can’t quite describe it in one word.[%p]
“Stop sending me all these short emails! I’m begging you, just gather your thoughts and send everything together!”[%p]
I feel a little satisfied after sending that email.[%p]
I turn to Kurisu again.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, Christina, what brings you here?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you’re going to call me names, could you at least be consistent?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, my business here doesn’t concern you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why are you pouting?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m not pouting. I just don’t want to get involved in your silly games again.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nonsense. You’re already a lab mem. You have a duty to work for the benefit of the lab!”[%p]
Well, she [color index="A0140000"]is[color index="800000"] only a temporary member.[%p]
No, it’s [color index="A0140000"]because[color index="800000"] she’s a temporary member that we need to get as much out of her as we can.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I regret losing myself to curiosity back then.”[%p]
Kurisu sighs and looks up at the satellite.[%p]
We’re not alone. Several other people are standing here and looking up.[%p]
It’s Akiba’s latest tourist attraction.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you come to see the satellite?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I guess.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It doesn’t make sense. Normally, they calculate satellites’ orbits so that they burn up in the atmosphere when they fall. So how can that thing be in such perfect condition?”[%p]
And that’s to say nothing about the huge hole it punched in the building.[%p]
Are satellites that durable?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where’s this satellite from, anyway?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“They still don’t know. Rumors say it’s from the former Soviet Union, but Russia denies it. So it looks like they can’t remove it yet.”[%p]
Three days have passed and it’s still unknown. How interesting.[%p]
I smell a conspiracy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So it’s another Organization cover-up! They knew I’d be at Radi-Kan and tried to erase me!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Organization? What’s that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The Organization is the Organization. Its formal name is something else, but all those who know of its existence call it the Organization out of fear.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They rule the world from the shadows, transcending nations, with politics, economics, religion, even science in their clutches.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s obviously a crackpot conspiracy theory, [color index="820000"]thank you very mu[color index="800000"]--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu hangs her head and blushes for some reason.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“N-nothing! Really, nothing, okay? Say another word and I hit you!”[%p]
Crazy girl.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“A-anyway! What’s happened with the PhoneWave!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I thought you didn’t want to get involved. And it’s not the PhoneWave, it’s the PhoneWave (name subject to change)--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Just answer me. Have you learned anything?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No progress. We’ve tried repeating the experiment, but at present, we haven’t been able to reproduce the discharge phenomenon or send another email to the past.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I see...”[%p]
Another email.[%p]
Damn you, Shining Finger. I said not to send so many short emails, but she doesn’t seem to get it![%p]
I can’t handle this mail demon.[%p]
Looks like she’s rethinking things.[%p]
Hopefully I don’t have to worry about any more email assaults.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hello? Can you put your phone away when you’re talking with someone?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t be like that. Rather, you should praise me, for I have taught a foul mail demon to behave like a civilized human being.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why are you so pompous?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’d ask you the same thing, Christina.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Okay, let’s send a reply.[%p]
“Apology accepted. I’m looking for an IBN 5100 too. I agree that we should exchange information. I’ll let you know when I have something. You don’t need to reply to this mail.”[%p]
I type that out and send it.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you done with your little mail exchange? Hououin-san?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh? So you remember my true name. Indeed, I am Hououin Kyouma.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I was being facetious.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How was that facetious? You called me by my correct name. You made no mistake. You’ll make a good assistant.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe-san... have you sought professional help?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am not Okabe!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This is exhausting...”[%p]
Let’s save checking the email for later.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re pompous, but at least you have some manners.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I hate people who play with their phones in the middle of a conversation.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah, so that’s why you grabbed my phone when we first met.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“When we first met? I didn’t do that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah you did. There I was, giving my report, when you grabbed my--”[%p]
...phone out of my hand. I shut my mouth before I finish.[%p]
The events at Radi-Kan.[%p]
My story of what happened back then doesn’t mesh with Daru’s story. It didn’t mesh with Mayuri’s. And now it won’t mesh Kurisu’s.[%p]
So in the end, was that a dream? A hallucination?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What? What do you mean ’giving your report’?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No. It’s nothing.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, about the PhoneWave (name subject to change).”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“After the experiment, you screamed something like ’A time machine? It can’t be!’ Did something awaken a past trauma?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No. And don’t go making one up either.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Back when she was five years old, Christina was on the plains of Arkansas when lightning--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I wasn’t hit by lightning! And I was still living in Japan when I was five! And why Arkansas?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I was trying to imagine tranquil scenery, and the first state to come to mind was Arkansas. Second was Oregon.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Not Utah? I mean, relatively speaking, isn’t Utah more suitable?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then answer me, Christina! Why did you freak out back then!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...No reason. I simply didn’t want to believe. Fringe science should stay in the realm of fiction.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Fringe science? Don’t be ridiculous.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You saw it with your own eyes. You saw the email leap to the past! You saw the banana travel instantly through space!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I saw... but we must be missing something. Or maybe we’re just seeing what we want to see.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Remember what I said at ATF? Time machines are just a pipe dream given modern technology.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And yet a bunch of amateurs like you just stick a phone and a microwave together and expect time travel to occur? Ridiculous.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But it did occur! Will you deny what you saw with your own eyes? Are you saying that theories trump reality? Then I hope you enjoy sophistry and word games, because that’s all you’ll ever have!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What do you mean, word games?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Quantum theory, for example. If you ask me, theories like that are nothing but word games!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wait, are you rejecting modern physics? Who do you think you are?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Trust what you see! The only things that matter are things that happen; things that don’t happen, things that aren’t observed, are just hypotheses!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“When hypotheses pile up, and theories are verified, they become reality.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s how modern physics comes to understand the truth of the universe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But sometimes your hypotheses are mistaken! Even Einstein was wrong about some things!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So you’re going to do nothing, just because you could be wrong? Then enjoy your dirty little lab and your silly gadgets, because that’s all you’ll ever have.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’ll never reach the truth that way. Failure teaches success.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see. Nice rebuttal.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...You’re never getting off your high horse, are you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By the way, Christina, I have always felt that physicists are hypocrites.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...What?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There are phenomena that everyone knows occur in reality, but which physicists refuse to research. What do you think about that?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t know what to say unless you can give me some examples.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ghosts, for instance.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The occult? Really?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You refuse to research it just because it’s the occult? That contradicts what you just said!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“’You’ll never reach the truth that way!’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“People have seen ghosts. There is even photographic evidence.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So where are the theories? Why do physicists refuse to speak?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...It’s a different field of study.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can’t call physics the study of natural phenomena, then decide some things don’t count!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“True, but...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And that’s why we must investigate the phenomenon of sending emails to the past. You shall assist me!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No.”[%p]
Kurisu gives me a clear cut answer.[%p]
Along with her usual glare.[%p]
So the genius girl really does hate me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I won’t have a hand in your fringe science. I won’t make the same mistake my father did.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your father?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You make a fine argument, but it won’t work in the scientific community.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The day you decide to research time travel is the day you’re out of a job.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How can you be so certain?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Because that’s what happened to my father.”[%p]
Kurisu grimaces.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“My father, a physicist, loved time machines. He was so fascinated by Wells’s ’The Time Machine’ that he seriously studied time travel.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But because of his obsession, he was practically exiled from the scientific community.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I will [color index="A0140000"]never[color index="800000"] get involved with time travel research!”[%p]
This time, her sheer force of will gives me pause.[%p]
Umm... I think she’s really pissed.[%p]
I may have stepped on a landmine here.[%p]
What do I do? If I get her any angrier, she might seriously hit me.[%p]
Let’s calm her down a little.[%p]
Yeah, let’s do that.[%p]
But what should I say?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I’m sorry. I got emotional.”[%p]
She apologizes first.[%p]
Christina’s calm character saves me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Muhahaha! Don’t worry about it! I wanted to test your character, so I made you angry on purpose!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Huh?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Anyway, the PhoneWave isn’t a time machine.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Email is a manmade system, so this phenomenon should be explainable in the scope of that system.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I understand. I had no idea you hate time machines that much. It’s almost like an allergy.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I apologize for forcing you to become a lab mem. You don’t have to come again.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I wasn’t planning on it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But know this, Christina.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t call me Christina.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lab Mem Number 004 will be a retired number. That number... is yours forever.”[%p]
I finish my speech and turn my back to Kurisu. I won’t look back.[%p]
I walk away slowly with my eyes closed.[%p]
It’s kind of hard to walk like this. Hope I don’t bump into anyone.[%p]
Wait, am I even walking straight?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You look ridiculous!”[%p]
My shoulder is suddenly pulled from behind.[%p]
I brace myself so I don’t fall backwards.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing!? You’ve ruined my perfectly-staged exit scene! And you call yourself my assistant!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No, I don’t call myself your assistant! And besides, I still have something to ask you!”[%p]
Dammit, her stubbornness has already returned![%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I asked you about this before, but you said I got stabbed, right? I demand an explanation.”[%p]
Ah yes, the other real-life phenomenon that has yet to be explained.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That was just something I hallucinated.”[%p]
Let’s just leave it at that for now.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why would you dream about me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t know. And it wasn’t a dream. It was a hallucination.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You said something about Doctor Nakabachi, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Doctor Nakabachi held a time machine presentation at Radi-Kan that day.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That presentation was canceled because of the satellite crash.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So it seems. But in my hallucination, the presentation proceeded as planned. Mayuri and I went to see it, and you came over to flirt with me.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t flirt. Especially not with idiots like you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Like I said, it wasn’t real, okay? No... maybe this world is what isn’t real.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That would explain the riddle of the PhoneWave (name subject to change). If this world is some kind of simulation, then we can disregard the laws of physics.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Escapism? That’s unexpectedly chicken of you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s a hypothesis. Your favorite thing.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So who stabbed me? Don’t tell me it was you.”[%p]
I recall the sight of Kurisu collapsed in a puddle of blood. It sends shivers down my spine.[%p]
Was that really just a hallucination? It was too real.[%p]
I can clearly remember the smell of blood.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You were already dead when I got there. I didn’t see who did it.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t get it. Why do I have to die in your mind? You have something against me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course not. At that point in time, we had only spoken once. We were just strangers.”[%p]
Well, that one time we talked was during the events I imagined. So strictly speaking, at that point in time, all I knew about her was what I’d read in the magazine.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, we didn’t know each other. That’s why I ran away instead of calling for an ambulance.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“My hero.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? You want me to go back in time and give you CPR or something? I’d need to use the PhoneWave (name subject to change) for that.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I’ve heard enough. No more hallucinating about me, okay? Dying isn’t fun, even if it’s in someone else’s head.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t make any guarantees. That would require perfect 24-hour surveillance inside my brain.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You have a comeback for everything, don’t you.”[%p]
Kurisu shakes her head in exasperation, then turns and walks off towards the station.[%p]
Looks like she wants to end the conversation.[%p]
In revenge for last time, I grab Kurisu’s slender shoulder from behind.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Kyah! What now!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not done talking!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You trying to pick a fight?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s revenge for ruining my farewell scene, Christina! You shall regret your thoughtless actions!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okay, okay, fine. What is it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“About the IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...If you don’t know, then forget about it. Farewell! We will not meet again.”[%p]
I turn my back to Kurisu. This time, I’ll make a perfect--[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey! Don’t tell me to forget about it!”[%p]
She grabs my arm.[%p]
Dammit! This is the second time![%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What is the IBN five... whatever?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then IBN 5100. It’s a retro PC from 1975. I’m looking for one.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yeah? What are you going to do with it?”[%p]
Looks like she’s interested.[%p]
She was the same way when she came to the lab. I guess this girl is just brimming with curiosity.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Interested?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu quickly averts her eyes.[%p]
But she doesn’t let go of my arm.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re interested, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Just a little.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then I shall answer! The IBN 5100 is the key to unlocking SERN’s most closely guarded secrets.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“SERN? You mean... [color index="A0140000"]the[color index="800000"] SERN?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Indeed. Through the tireless efforts of my faithful lab mems, we have uncovered evidence that SERN is researching time travel.”[%p]
Come! Be astonished![%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Great. I shouldn’t have asked.”[%p]
Kurisu gives me a cold glare, then lets go and starts walking away. This time, she’s gone for good.[%p]
Damn you![%p]
Just you watch.[%p]
I will expose SERN’s secrets if it’s the last thing I do![%p]
