The next day, I decide to hit Akiba’s computer parts stores.[%p]
I did as much as I could yesterday, after parting with Kurisu, but no luck.[%p]
Finding an IBN 5100 is obviously going to be a huge pain in the ass.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmmm...”[%p]
I’m standing in the narrow tunnel that runs beside the Radi-Kan building. Small shops selling everything from motherboards to resistors to vacuum tubes line both sides of the tunnel.[%p]
Here lie the vestiges of the old Electric Town. Akiba’s conscience, so to speak.[%p]
Casual otaku usually avoid stores like these. It’s like a holy land that only true fanatics can enter.[%p]
Not that I’m an expert on computer parts.[%p]
Furthermore, these shops only sell parts, so it’s actually kind of silly to be searching for a whole PC here. Still, something about the sight of all these electronics gets my blood pumping. [%p]
I have to hide my excitement to maintain my dignity. If a storekeeper yells, “Hey, kid! You’re ten years too young for this stuff!” then I’ll have no choice but to run.[%p]
Fortunately, no one has yelled at me yet. In fact, the storekeepers seem to be ignoring me. They must be more open-minded than I thought. Or maybe they just don’t care.[%p]
I search each store in turn, but turn up neither hide nor hair of an IBN 5100.[%p]
The ringing of my phone draws a sharp look from the nearest storekeeper.[%p]
I force a smile and rush outside.[%p]
