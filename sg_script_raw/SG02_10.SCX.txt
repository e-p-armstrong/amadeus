[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. What’s up?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Tutturu♪ Mayushii here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I thought I told you not to contact me on this line. It could be tapped.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Huhwha?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m telling you to not be so careless. Anyway, give me a sitrep.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Um, Okarin? Mayushii doesn’t know what that means...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m asking why you’re calling.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Why didn’t you just say that?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Um, what are you doing now?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Executing the mission.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Executing the missus?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The mission! I’m looking for an IBN 5100!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Ehehe! Well why didn’t you say so? Mayushii heard something amazing just now.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Wanna hear?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If it’s valuable information, then by all means.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Well, then come to MayQueen! I’ll be waiting♪”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, tell me over the phone! Hey, Mayuri!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why do I have to go all the way to MayQueen...”[%p]
I complain, but it’s less than a ten minute walk.[%p]
Whatever. I haven’t had lunch, so I guess I’ll eat while I’m there.[%p]
There’s a handwritten sign outside MayQueen that says “Today’s the Faris Cup, nyan♪”.[%p]
While I’m trying to figure out what that means...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
Mayuri trots up to me in full maid regalia.[%p]
She has a convenience store bag in hand.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii went to the convenience store during lunch break.”[%p]
Then Mayuri takes out her pocket watch, Pockety. She checks the time.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Now there’s only five minutes left!”[%p]
Mayuri squats next to the stairs.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Good work. So, what was that amazing thing you heard?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Before that, food.”[%p]
She takes some fried chicken out of the convenience store bag as she speaks.[%p]
The aroma of the chicken stirs my appetite.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let me have one.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay.”[%p]
She skewers a piece of chicken on a toothpick and holds it out for me.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Here you go♪”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can’t do that in front of the store. You’re supposed to be a maid.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Here, you’re not Shiina Mayuri, but Mayushii NyanNyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can’t ’say aah’ in front of the store! Your customers are going to see that as an act of betrayal.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh! Mayushii didn’t think of that.”[%p]
With that said, I take the chicken off the toothpick by hand and throw it into my mouth.[%p]
Mmm, delicious. Not as good as Juicy Chicken Number One, though.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well? What was that amazing thing you heard?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, right! Actually, it’s about the IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You found a lead!? Of course, it was at MayQueen! I can’t believe I missed it!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“No it’s not! That’s silly!”[%p]
Damn! Don’t get my hopes up like that.[%p]
Mayuri has a triumphant look on her face, but I don’t see where this is going at all.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii was thinking of the IBN 5100 during work, so I asked the other girls if they knew anything.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“First I asked Makki-chan, but Makki-chan said she’s not good with computers.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And then there’s LisaLisa-chan, but she only knows about the latest PCs. And she’s actually a Machead...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just get to the point. I don’t really care how much trouble you went through.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hm? Um, well, I think Feris-chan knows.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What!? Is that true!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup. Did you know she’s a retro PC maniac?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris?”[%p]
That girl is seriously hardcore. I’d prefer to stay away from her if possible.[%p]
But I’m really desperate for information.[%p]
I take out my phone and put it to my ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. Looks like we’ve got a lead on the IBN 5100. Are you ready for this? It’s Faris NyanNyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It turns out that catgirl’s an expert on retro PCs. There’s probably another side to this. Let’s keep our eyes peeled.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Hmph. I suppose I’m the only man for the job. Very well. I’ll make the approach.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you don’t hear from me by 2000 hours tonight, then forget about me and commence the strike on MayQueen.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Everything is the choice of Steins Gate... El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
I put away my phone, grab another piece of chicken, and look up at MayQueen’s window.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ahh! I didn’t say you could have two!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well done, Mayuri! I’ll see that your information is put to good use!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“My chicken...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By the way, what’s this Feris Cup about?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“My chicken...”[%p]
Mayuri is stuffing the remaining chicken into her mouth as fast as she can. There are tears in her eyes.[%p]
Come on, it was just two.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, whatever. I’m uneasy about the lack of intel, but the mission must go on.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait here, Mayuri. If I don’t return within the hour, go home immediately. Understood?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I can’t! I have to work.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Anyway. Let’s leave Mayuri to her chicken and begin the approach.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Welcome, Myaster♪”[%p]
When I enter the cafe, it’s fully occupied, unlike usual.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyanya♪ Is Kyouma gonna join too?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Today’s the Faris Cup, nya!”[%p]
Doesn’t look like she plans to explain what that is.[%p]
I take my phone out again.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. Run a search on the Faris Cup.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What!? A battle to the death where the winner gets to use Faris however he pleases!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Looks like I’ve stepped into one hell of a mess. ...No, there’s no problem. I’ll survive... by any means necessary. El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
I put away my phone and turn to Faris.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The Faris Cup is a battle royale, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“No, nya. It’s a cat-eat-cat battle royale where the winner gets to make Faris his slave, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Ahh, no, you can’t! You can’t claw at each other’s throats over Faris, nya! Please, stop nya!”[%p]
Faris starts crying and wriggling her body seductively.[%p]
That’s some pretty good acting, but of course, no one here is killing anyone.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma, please, nya. Stop them.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry. There’s nobody for me to stop. Everyone’s sitting silently in their seats.”[%p]
Nevertheless, the atmosphere here is different. I sense bloodlust in the air.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, seriously, what’s the Faris Cup?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“A paw-to-paw contest with Faris nya. Faris goes at it with everyone at the same time nyan. A reward goes to those Faris finds worthy, nya.”[%p]
I gulp and look at Faris hard.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris, are you serious!?”[%p]
Going at it with all these men at the same time? She’s insane.[%p]
But Faris grins.[%p]
A fang-like tooth peeks out from her glistening red lips.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...If you don’t do something, Faris is gonna become everyone’s plaything, nya.”[%p]
Faris approaches me.[%p]
Her slender fingers touch my arm.[%p]
Her caress gives me goosebumps.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Save Faris’s fur, Kyouma...”[%p]
I can’t take my eyes off her. I’ve been entranced.[%p]
This girl has the power to bend men to her will. I must resist.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I refuse!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“NyaNya!?”[%p]
I shake her paws off.[%p]
Phew, that was close. She has one hell of an evil eye.[%p]
I barely escaped enticement, and only because I am the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I didn’t come to fight. I only came to talk to you.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If you’re not going to play, then I’m sorry, but I’ll have to ask you to leave, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s this? A maid, sending a customer away?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris is the organyaizer of the Faris Cup today. Only participants are allowed inside the shop, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I only need two minutes. The IBN--”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Not listening, nyan!”[%p]
Faris puts her hands over her ears. Her real ears, not the cat ears.[%p]
Then she laughs mischievously.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If you want to talk to Faris, you have no choice but to join the Faris Cup, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Now that’s just low.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So, what’ll it be nyan? You can’t survive unless you fight with your own paws, nyan!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Use any method to obtain information. That’s my current mission.[%p]
I have to do it! No matter what lies ahead![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s no choice. I accept your challenge. But on one condition.”[%p]
I thrust my finger at the tip of Faris’ nose.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If I face you, you’ll tell me everything you know!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“NyaNya? Well, fine by me nya...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Well then, Master, this way, nyannyan♪”[%p]
She sticks a nametag onto my chest.[%p]
The number 28 is written on it with round, girly numbers.[%p]
I cautiously let Faris lead me to the back of the cafe, and finally learn what the customers are doing.[%p]
Everyone’s engrossed in some kind of card game.[%p]
Now I remember. The other day, Faris said that she was doing a RaiNet AccessBattlers tournament. That’s the Faris Cup. If you win, you get to eat Faris’s home cooking, or something like that.[%p]
Tch, looks like Faris tricked me.[%p]
“Save me,” she said. “Nya,” she said.[%p]
I knew she was not to be trifled with.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? Why are you here? You don’t do RaiNet.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha, Daru!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing here!? What about SERN!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Let me rest for one day, man. You should treat me better after two consecutive all-nighters.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“SERN’s power grows stronger by the day, and here you are without a care in the world.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’re here too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I came here for an unrelated matter and got dragged into this nonsense. I’m not interested in RaiNet or Faris’s home cooking.”[%p]
The second those words leave my lips, I feel like everyone in the store is glaring at me.[%p]
They want my blood.[%p]
Come to think of it, the Faris Cup was organized by Faris, so it makes sense that only Faris fans would participate. In other words, I’m the Away Team.[%p]
Tch, I’m surrounded by enemies.[%p]
But this is something I must do.[%p]
This is just one more step on my road to the IBN 5100.[%p]
Obtain information using any means necessary.[%p]
With that mission in mind, I sit next to Daru and softly whisper to him.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, Operation Sigma.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What’s that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m saying we should cooperate. We’ll be the strongest if we team up, right?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“More like you’re gonna drag me down. You’re a noob at this game, Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But you’re my right-hand man. As long as we’re together, we have nothing to fear.”[%p]
Daru flashes his white teeth in a grin.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But I refuse. I’m in this thing to win.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And you call yourself my friend!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“In this tournament, we’re enemies.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You traitor! Why do you think I sent you into this cafe as a spy?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But you didn’t send me. I’m Faris-tan’s biggest fan. I check her blog every day and--”[%p]
Suddenly the cafe’s lights dim.[%p]
A song starts playing.[%p]
A somewhat solemn melody, with sexy and powerful female vocals.[%p]
I’ve heard this song a lot recently. Pretty sure it’s the theme song to RaiNet Kakeru.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hi everyone♪ Thanks for waiting, nyan! The afternoon Faris Cup is about to begin nya!”[%p]
Faris appears in a spotlight. The previously peaceful audience instantly explodes in excitement.[%p]
Everyone stands up and shouts in unison with their fists raised skyward.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Thank you, nya!”[%p]
Faris responds to the shouts of joy with a wave of her hand, then clears her throat.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“The rules are simple. Faris will face off against each one of you nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris will even go paw-to-paw with ten people at once, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If you beat Faris, you’ll get her home cooking as a reward, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Now then, everyone! Enjoy the contest!”[%p]
Lots are drawn to determine the order we face Faris.[%p]
Seems like there are 28 participants, including me.[%p]
Faris will face ten people at the same time, so she divides us into three rounds.[%p]
I’m in the third round.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Gwah... strong Faris is strong...”[%p]
Daru, a first-round participant, was insta-killed by Faris.[%p]
How weak. And he said I was going to be the burden.[%p]
No, maybe Faris is just too strong.[%p]
RaiNet AccessBattlers is similar to chess.[%p]
There’s a special board where you compete using pieces arranged in rows.[%p]
The rules are fairly complicated, but basically, the point of the game is to get your pieces into the enemy camp. Whoever gets the most pieces into the enemy camp wins.[%p]
Faris is playing against ten people at once.[%p]
She moves from table to table in a circle, taking one move at each before proceeding to the next.[%p]
In go, shogi, and chess, this is called a simultaneous exhibition. High-level players hold them to demonstrate their skill.[%p]
And Faris does indeed seem to be highly skilled, just as Daru said.[%p]
All ten of the first-round participants are annihilated within 15 minutes.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyahaha♪ I hope the next group tries a little harder nyan.”[%p]
Damn you, Faris. Don’t get cocky.[%p]
I lean back against the wall and silently watch the round 2 matches.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Feris-chan sure is strong.”[%p]
Mayuri returns from her break with a drink in hand and whispers to me.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s bad at RaiNet, so I’m really jealous.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What would you do if you were good at it?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Don’t you know? RaiNet AccessBattlers isn’t just popular in Akiba. It’s a global blend!”[%p]
Blend? So... it’s coffee?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I think you mean trend.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah, that. So if you get good at it, you’re sure to be every kid’s hero!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hero, huh... That doesn’t sound bad.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Besides, Upa is so cute♪”[%p]
Upa, as everyone knows, is RaiNet’s mascot character.[%p]
These days he’s more popular than that electric yellow rat.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait. There’s something strange about your argument. How does RaiNet skill relate to Upa’s cuteness?”[%p]
I guess they’re related in Mayuri’s mind.[%p]
She must be after those limited Upa plushes they give out to participants in official tournaments.[%p]
You’ll never become the strongest with such impure intentions, Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Feris-chan’s too busy to go to tournaments, but I think she’s definitely a world-class player.”[%p]
If that’s the case, these faceless rabble participating in the Faris Cup are unworthy opponents.[%p]
Just as expected, round 2 ends the same as round 1.[%p]
Nobody’s even close to Faris’s level.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“NyanNyan. Sorry, nya, but Faris never pulls punches in RaiNet.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I want someone who can go paw-to-paw with me, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Gwohh! Feris-tan is too strong! We can’t win. It was hopeless from the get-go!”[%p]
A thick mood of defeat has already spread across the challengers. Some of them are even on their knees in shame.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph! You’re all pathetic.”[%p]
I stride to the front of the crowd.[%p]
I nonchalantly meet Faris’s questioning gaze.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But we’ve been saving the best for last.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru! Allow me to show you... how a true man fights.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Don’t tell me you’ve got a plan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph. Indeed I do. Let’s just call this Operation ’Sweet Side’.”[%p]
A loud ’ohh!’ echoes from all around me.[%p]
Those cruelly defeated by Faris entrust their hopes unto me... unto us all, the eight Round 3 participants.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]Avenge us, they say.[%e]
I can feel their pain. It gives me strength.[%p]
At first, we were enemies. But now, our hearts are joined against the indomitable might of Faris.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So Kyouma thinks he’s up to par, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The tears of the fallen twenty... shall not be in vain.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you remember our promise, Faris? Once this match is over, you’ll tell me everything you know.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Amazing! That crazy bastard actually means to win!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Go for it, Okarin♪”[%p]
The crowd goes wild.[%p]
They place their hopes on me.[%p]
I slowly step up to the table.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Five minutes. That’s all it will take to decide the match.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Okay! Round 3, start nya♪ RaiNet AccesssBattlers, duel access!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I give up.”[%p]
It didn’t even take five minutes.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’re weak! Too weak!”[%p]
Obviously! I’ve never played RaiNet AccessBattlers before![%p]
There’s no way I can win if I don’t even know the rules![%p]
By the way, I’m not alone. All eight of the third-round contestants were blown out.[%p]
And thus, the tournament ends in total victory for Faris.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s disappointed...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So it was all a bluff!? What happened to Operation ’Sweet Side’!?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It was almost like Kyouma committed suicide, nya.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, don’t tell me...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Muhahaha! Yes! It’s exactly what you’re thinking!”[%p]
I leap onto a chair and strike an awesome pose, bathing the losers below me in scorn.[%p]
Why the long faces, men!?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Operation Sweet Side was a [color index="A0140000"]suicide[color index="800000"] attack!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s gotta be the worst pun ever!”[%p]
I don’t know the rules. What else could I do?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But why are you so proud even though I made kitty litter outta you, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh. Have you not figured it out, Faris NyanNyan!? Win or lose, it made no difference.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“What’s that supposed to mean, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you remember the conditions I set?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Mya? If Faris lost, then she’d tell you everything--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No! You are wrong, Faris. What I said was...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“’If I face you, you’ll tell me everything you know!’ If I [color index="A0140000"]face[color index="800000"] you. Now do you understand?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I never needed to win!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No one else could have pulled it off. These fools were lured here by the prospect of Faris’s home cooking. They were obsessed with winning.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But not I! Your home cooking meant nothing to me! That difference in motivation is what allowed this suicide mission to succeed!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh, muhahahaha, MUHAHAHAHAHA!”[%p]
My laughter echoes throughout the cafe.[%p]
Everyone is staring at me in disbelief.[%p]
Mayuri’s the only one to applaud.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow, Okarin! You’re amazing!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Th-that’s dirty...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I think you mean fiendishly clever! Behold the success of Operation Sweet Side!”[%p]
I get off the chair and walk to Faris.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now, Faris. Answer me. Where is the IBN 5100!?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nya? The IBN 5100?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t play dumb. I have a reliable source.”[%p]
I remember that image of the IBN 5100 Shining Finger sent me. I bring it up on my phone and show it to Faris.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know that you have information on the IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nya... how do you expect me to remember that, nya? Though I think I’ve seen this computer before...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What!? I thought you were an expert on retro PCs! Mayuri told me so!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uh, you leaked your source...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup! Mayushii’s a reliable source!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’m not an [color index="A0140000"]expert[color index="800000"], nya. Papa collected them, so we’ve got tons at home, that’s all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So that must be where the IBN 5100 is sealed! Take me there at once!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I can’t, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What!? Why!?”[%p]
Faris puts on a bewitching smile.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Because that’s the Faris Clan’s sanctuary.”[%p]
The... Faris Clan?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“The only ones who may enter are the Faris Clan’s cat-eared daughters: those who purrsue the knowledge of the meow miko.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“In other words, it’s paws-off to everybody but Faris, nya. Try to force your way in... and you’ll grow dog ears, nya!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Like hell I will! Dog ears!? Yeah right!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I-it’s true, nya... Faris doesn’t tell tall tails, nya...”[%p]
She suddenly starts acting like a scared little catgirl.[%p]
Instantly, the air is charged with malice. I find myself surrounded by 27 Faris fans, each glaring at me with bloodshot eyes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You coward! You’ve converted your believers into your personal army!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris is only telling the truth, nya...”[%p]
The defeated are now under Faris’s complete control. They approach at a shuffle, muttering foul prayers to their cat goddess.[%p]
[margin top="38"][margin left="640"]“You made Faris cry.”[linebreak][margin left="160"]“I’ll never forgive you. Never.”[linebreak][margin left="560"]“Faris is my wife.”[linebreak][margin left="240"]“Cat ears are justice!.”[linebreak][margin left="80"]“I want to chew on those cat ears.”[linebreak][margin left="320"]“Faris-tan hahhh hahhh”[linebreak][margin left="0"]“I want to lick Faris’s feet.”[linebreak][margin left="460"]“I want her to step on me hard.”[%e]
Crap. These guys are serious.[%p]
I need the information Faris possesses, but I’m at too great a disadvantage now to press the attack.[%p]
And then there’s my personal weakness to Faris’s powers.[%p]
At this rate, I might be assimilated into the Faris cult.[%p]
What do I do!?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gwaahhh!”[%p]
I cry out and seize my right wrist.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, n-not now... it’s too soon!”[%p]
My right hand trembles.[%p]
I show agony on my face as I try desperately to control the trembling.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“No! Don’t tell me! Is the Anti-RaiNet System activating!? I warned you playing RaiNet could kill you!”[%p]
What? Where did that come from!?[%p]
I ignore Faris and stagger towards the exit. Her worshippers let me pass.[%p]
It feels as if everyone is giving me cold stares, but I don’t have the time to check and make sure.[%p]
I throw myself out the door and into open air.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn, empty handed...”[%p]
The throbbing in my right arm settles as soon as I leave the cafe.[%p]
I guess I’ll ask Daru or Mayuri about Faris some other day.[%p]
It feels like all of my exhaustion has caught up with me.[%p]
And to make matters worse, it’s boiling hot today. The sun’s getting stronger as we enter August.[%p]
Fed up with the heat, I wipe the sweat off my brow.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
Mayuri chases after me.[%p]
She’s smiling and waving at me, but her speed is clearly faster than mine.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What happened? Is the Faris Cup already over?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Nope. Well, just about. After this, the customers get to chat with Feris-chan.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I wanted to tell you about that IBN 5100 thing. I showed Feris-chan the picture again.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Good work, Mayuri! Completely different from a certain useless super hacka! So?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Feris-chan said it was probably around the time she was in elementary school.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“On a cold autumn day, while Feris-chan was shivering from the cold, her butler Kuroki-san came to help--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t care about her butler! Just get to the point!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So basically, she ended up donating one of her dad’s computers to a shrine. She says it looked just like the one you’re looking for.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Donated it... to a shrine?”[%p]
That’s an unexpected combination.[%p]
PCs... and shrines. Consumer electronics... and ancient Shinto rituals.[%p]
They’re not even tangentially related.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Which shrine?”[%p]
Mayuri tilts her head in confusion.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Dunno. Where could it be?”[%p]
You didn’t ask her?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whatever. It’s a lead.”[%p]
The only shrines in Akiba are Kanda Myojin and Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
I don’t know if Faris was living in Akiba at the time, but at least it’s a start.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Good work, Mayuri. Continue your espionage mission.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]”SPN hodge?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whatever, it doesn’t matter. Bye.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay! Bye bye♪”[%p]
Instead of returning to work, she keeps waving to me until I’ve vanished from sight.[%p]
