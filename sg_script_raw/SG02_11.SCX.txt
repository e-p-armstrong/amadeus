Whew, that was close.[%p]
I probably shouldn’t go back in there today.[%p]
I take a deep breath to calm myself down. That’s when something strange catches my eye.[%p]
There’s a woman squatting on the ground nearby, her knees against her chest.[%p]
In her hand is a gaudy purple phone. She’s staring at the screen without moving a muscle.[%p]
She’s even more conspicuous since nobody else is around.[%p]
And on further inspection, I realize it’s someone I know.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Shining Finger!”[%p]
I call out to her, but she gives me no reaction.[%p]
Shining Finger is just a name I made up, so I guess it’s only natural.[%p]
Umm, her name was Moe... Moekko? No...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Finger!”[%p]
I stand in front of her and call her name -- well, the name I gave her -- but she doesn’t even look at me.[%p]
Her fingers are typing rapidly on her phone, so she’s definitely conscious.[%p]
But she still looks dead. There’s no life in her eyes.[%p]
I’m actually worried. Despite the heat, she’s not sweating at all.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can’t you hear me?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Who?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hououin Kyouma! The mad scientist.”[%p]
She glances at me for maybe half a second, then goes right back to staring at her phone.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Who?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? Can’t you even remember people’s faces?”[%p]
Of course, I’m the one who forgot her name...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I agreed to help you find an IBN 5100, remember? And this is the thanks I get?”[%p]
She twitches upon hearing the word IBN 5100.[%p]
But she still doesn’t look up.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Okabe-kun...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s Hououin.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Ignoring me, are you? Why won’t you accept me as Hououin Kyouma?[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Sent... email.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Email?”[%p]
Well, I did just receive an email.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I nearly flip out.[%p]
Is this really something you should say by email when the person is standing right in front of you?[%p]
It wouldn’t take five seconds to say it verbally![%p]
She’s friendly enough in her emails, but in person, she’s a lump of unsociability.[%p]
How can she write “Funny meeting you here♪” without smiling at all? It makes me think the mails are coming from a different person.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I suppose it is quite a coincidence. Were you looking through the parts stores too?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
She doesn’t even respond when I ask her a direct question.[%p]
Another email.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why won’t you speak!?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...too hard.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Isn’t it harder to type everything out!?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
My yelling does not have the desired effect. Instead of getting her act together, she buries her face into her knees.[%p]
And why is she wearing such a short skirt? If she sits with her knees up like this, I can see everything. Not that there’s a problem with that![%p]
I sigh, then turn and walk away.[%p]
I buy two Max Coffees from a nearby vending machine.[%p]
The mails keep coming...[%p]
I’m more tired than angry.[%p]
Besides, my search has hit a dead end, so I need whatever information she has on the IBN 5100. I can’t just go home.[%p]
Come to think of it, her name was Moeka, right? I remembered when I saw her email.[%p]
I return to Moeka with the two Max Coffees in hand.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Ah, Okabe-kun...”[%p]
She’s finally on her feet.[%p]
She glances at me, then breathes a sigh of relief.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Want one?”[%p]
She timidly accepts the Max Coffee I hand to her.[%p]
But she doesn’t move to open it.[%p]
I wait for the coffee to cool down, open the tab, and take a sip.[%p]
Sometimes this sweetness is just what I need.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why don’t you talk?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Emailing... is easier.”[%p]
Like hell it is.[%p]
Maybe she’s just afraid of people.[%p]
When I finally consider that, I’m taken aback by my own thoughtlessness.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course. So that’s what it is!”[%p]
Basically, she’s afraid.[%p]
Afraid of the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma![%p]
Well, I can hardly blame her. In fact, I sympathize.[%p]
Few indeed can withstand my aura of supreme madness.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’m... weird, aren’t I...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, you’re normal.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Really...?”[%p]
For no matter how disciplined your mind is, you cannot resist![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You have nothing to be ashamed of. In this world, there exists something called absolute eternal truth. It’s a wall, immovable no matter how much you struggle.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s why people give up, abandon their dreams, choose a different path.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But never forget this one thing. You hold within your heart your own Steins Gate.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Steins Gate...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“All people, without exception, possess their own Steins Gate. As long as you have yours, you may follow any path without losing your way... just as I follow mine.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka nods.[%p]
Looks like I got her to understand.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, on to business. Do you have any information on the IBN 5100?”[%p]
Moeka answers by shaking her head slightly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How long have you been searching?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...About two months.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where have you looked?”[%p]
And of course, Moeka starts to move her fingers at high speed.[%p]
Four people in two months...[%p]
Even though hordes of otaku come to Akiba each day.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you tried talking to PC store employees? They’d know more than anyone else.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka shakes her head again.[%p]
She’s clearly not cut out for this job. Sincere as she may be, she’s just wasting time.[%p]
That editorial company she works for must be incompetent if they chose her as their investigator.[%p]
Though I suppose it’s also her fault for accepting the job despite her handicap.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So what’s your actual goal? To obtain an IBN 5100, or to investigate the urban legend?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Both.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see.”[%p]
In that case, her search is limited to IBN 5100s in Akihabara.[%p]
But I don’t care about the urban legend. I just want to obtain an IBN 5100. My true goal is what comes afterwards.[%p]
So I don’t need to limit myself to IBN 5100s in Akihabara.[%p]
I could just look online. I might be able to get one through auction. That would take time and money, though.[%p]
If I don’t find one in another few days, let’s consider that option.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where do you plan to search next?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“That’s...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’m...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hm? I didn’t quite hear you.”[%p]
Moeka types out a mail at high speed.[%p]
She’s useless.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry. I have a network of informants at my disposal. Finding a retro PC should be no trouble at all.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka looks at me for the first time today. I see respect in her eyes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you forgotten who I am? Hououin Kyouma! I will stop at nothing to destroy the System and usher in a new era of chaos! Muhahaha!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“That’s... Okabe-kun’s Steins Gate...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Not Okabe! Hououin!”[%p]
