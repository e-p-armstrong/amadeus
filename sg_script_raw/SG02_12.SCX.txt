After parting with Shining Finger, I go to a nearby PC store to talk to an employee I happen to know.[%p]
But naturally, he doesn’t know where to find an IBN 5100 either.[%p]
Apparently, it was easier to find retro PCs ten years ago, back when there were more underground niche stores.[%p]
Now those stores are all but vanished, driven out by stricter regulations and the inexorable spread of moe culture.[%p]
So I can’t really say it’s Moeka’s fault that she’s not useful.[%p]
After all, I’m stumped too, and this is only my second day searching.[%p]
Hunting for an IBN 5100 on a internet auction site is starting to look more appealing than confining my search to Akiba. But again, that would take time and money.[%p]
That reminds me, Mayuri called before I met with Shining Finger.[%p]
It’s rare for the absent-minded Mayuri to be the one to contact me. I’m usually the one to contact her.[%p]
I wonder what she wanted.[%p]
Should I try calling her back?[%p]
But where could she be now?[%p]
She’s not at work, is she?[%p]
If she is, then I probably won’t be able to get ahold of her.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Tutturu♪ Mayushii here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. What’s the situation?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okarin!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“I just called you!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. Did something happen?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Actually, try calling Daru-kun.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? Why?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Daru-kun’s at MayQueen right now. You should call him. He’ll tell you.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Bye bye!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait! Hey, Mayuri! Hey!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
She hung up.[%p]
Doesn’t look like she wants to explain.[%p]
Even if I call back, Mayuri will probably just say the same thing.[%p]
Let’s do what Mayuri said.[%p]
Crap, I messed up.[%p]
I called someone else.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“What’s up?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. Report the situation.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okarin? You’re the only one who talks like that. Did you hear from Mayu-shi?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, she didn’t tell me anything.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Well, I’m at MayQueen right now.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Mayu-shi did some investigating. Sounds like Faris-tan knows about the IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What!? Faris!?”[%p]
Don’t tell me that catgirl and the IBN 5100 are connected somehow.[%p]
I can’t even imagine how they could be.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“I understand your confusion, but apparently there are a lot of retro PCs at her home.”[%p]
That’s some unexpected good news.[%p]
The tables have turned, and now I’m close to my goal.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This too is the choice of Steins Gate!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“I don’t get you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, is Faris there?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Of course. Today’s the Faris Cup.”[%p]
Faris Cup?[%p]
What’s that? I think I remember hearing about it, but I never really paid it any attention.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“When I showed Faris-tan an image of the IBN 5100, she said she donated a similar PC to a shrine ten years ago. Dunno if it’s the one we want, though.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She donated it... to a shrine?”[%p]
That’s an unexpected combination.[%p]
PCs... and shrines. Consumer electronics... and ancient Shinto rituals.[%p]
They’re not even tangentially related.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Which shrine?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Uh, didn’t ask. My bad.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whatever. It’s a lead.”[%p]
The only shrines in Akiba are Kanda Myojin and Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
I don’t know if Faris was living in Akiba at the time, but at least it’s a start.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Well, I’m hanging up. The Faris Cup is about to begin.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see. Daru, I’m sure you can do it. Be sure to win.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Leave it to me!”[%p]
What the hell is a Faris Cup anyway?[%p]
No, more importantly, the shrine.[%p]
Let’s contact her, not by phone, but by email.[%p]
I send an email and get a reply in a matter of minutes.[%p]
That’s it? Call Daru?[%p]
What does this mean?[%p]
I guess there’s no choice. I’ll call Daru.[%p]
