Kanda Myojin is the larger and more popular shrine, so nine out of ten people would choose to donate something there.[%p]
But when I inquire at the shrine office, nobody knows anything about an old computer.[%p]
That leaves Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
It’s probably not there either, but I have to try.[%p]
If that fails, I’ll have to search all of Tokyo’s shrines one by one.[%p]
The thought alone makes me dizzy, so I set it aside for now.[%p]
