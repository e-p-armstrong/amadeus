[name]Rintaro[line]“Who is this?”[%p]
[name]???[line][color index="8A0000"]“...”[%p]
What? All I can hear is noise. Wrong number?[%p]
No, maybe--[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re from the Organization, aren’t you? Is this a warning? You telling me to stop getting involved with SERN?”[%p]
[name]???[line][color index="8A0000"]“Huh?”[%p]
Hm? It’s a woman’s voice.[%p]
And she clearly doesn’t understand what I’m talking about.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re not from the Organization?”[%p]
[name]???[line][color index="8A0000"]“...No. It’s Makise.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Makise...”[%p]
Who?[%p]
I think I remember this voice from somewhere...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry, but I don’t remember. Tell me where we met. Paris? Or London, perh--”[%p]
[name]Woman Named Makise[line][color index="8A0000"]“Akihabara. We saw each other yesterday, remember?”[%p]
Yesterday?[%p]
Makise... Makise...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh! My assistant!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Not your assistant! Makise Kurisu!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you don’t say Christina, then I have no way of knowing it’s you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“I’m not Christina either! How many times do I have to tell you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You never stop complaining, do you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Whose fault is that? Whose?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait a minute. How do you know my phone number?”[%p]
Something’s not right here. It’s not like Kurisu’s free of suspicion. She could still be a spy.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Hashida-san told me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, that’s boring. So, what is it, assistant?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“I said I’m not your assistant.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Haah, what’s the point... Where are you now?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m headed to Yanabayashi Shrine.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Ah, okay. Bye then.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh? What!? What was that!? Is she messing with me!? She’s messing with me!”[%p]
How dare my assistant treat me like this!?[%p]
I shall scold her most harshly the next time we meet.[%p]
She thinks she’s all that just because she was published in a major journal.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your accomplishments mean nothing to me.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What are you talking about?”[%p]
When I arrive at Yanabayashi Shrine, I find my assistant waiting there for some reason.[%p]
She glares at me with her usual frown.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What was that phone call about?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I just wanted to ask you where you were. And since you said you were coming here, I came.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nobody asked you to come.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And yet, here I am.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Why is she always in such a bad mood?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why did you come to see me?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Not because I [color index="A0140000"]wanted[color index="800000"] to or anything. Don’t get me wrong.”[%p]
She just keeps those abusive words coming.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I can’t stop thinking about what you said yesterday.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What I said?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“About the IBN 5100. And SERN.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course! You’re working for SERN, not the Organization! You’re here to kill me, aren’t you!? That’s what I thought! You have the face of a killer!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What’s wrong with my face? How rude!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Can you calm down a bit? You’re always screwing around. I can’t believe you’re older than me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Calm down? Hmph! You don’t understand what it’s like to live on the run, never knowing when the next assassin will strike.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“All I’m hearing is gibberish.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You come here to pick a fight?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I just want to know how the IBN 5100 and SERN are related.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t you mean you’re interested in SERN’s time machine research? Be honest with yourself.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sh-shut up. I’m not interested in time machines at all.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“More importantly, did you find an IBN 5100?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]That’s why I’m here.”[%p]
Kurisu looks up at Yanabayashi Shrine’s small archway.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“A shrine?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Correct.”[%p]
Then, with perfect timing, a beautiful girl -- er, boy -- dressed in miko garb appears from the nearby shrine office, holding a bamboo broom.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ah, Oka... Kyouma-san, hello.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Lukako, why don’t you have it?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Huh? Um, are you talking about Demon Sword Samidare?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I thought I told you to carry it at all times!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m sorry, but, it gets in the way when I’m cleaning, so...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What if they attack while you’re cleaning? Nobody’s going to come to your rescue, you know.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Th-that’s true... I’ll be more careful from now on.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey. What are you two talking about?”[%p]
Lukako finally notices Kurisu and gives me a puzzled look.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... who might this be?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“My assistant.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No! What kind of introduction is that!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m only telling the truth, Christina.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“You’re n-not Japanese?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I am Japanese.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, Lukako. I need to talk to your father about--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wait! Introduce me properly!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You want to be introduced? Properly?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s unnatural [color index="A0140000"]not[color index="800000"] to be introduced in this situation!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I didn’t come here to introduce you to Lukako!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“An introduction wouldn’t take more than ten seconds! What’s wrong with you?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... please don’t fight...”[%p]
Lukako’s flustered. Looks like he thinks we’re fighting.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is Makise Kurisu. My assistant.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yeah, whatever. Assistant, whatever... sigh.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Nice to meet you, Makise-san. I’m Urushibara L-Luka.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Nice to meet you too. How old are you?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“17 this year.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“A year younger than me...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Oh, really? Makise-san, you’re so grown up, I can’t believe we’re only a year apart.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That means you look old.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
She glares at me.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“No, that’s not what I... um, I mean you’re very beautiful!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thanks. I think you’re very cute.”[%p]
But he’s a guy. I probably shouldn’t tell her that.[%p]
The shock from learning the truth might be enough to make her go back to America.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re introduced. Happy? Can we move on now?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You are such a jerk.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, Lukako, I require an audience with your father. Can you make it happen?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]”Yes, sure, but why do you need to talk to my dad?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s a grave matter that concerns the future of mankind.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“The future...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Of mankind?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’ll go get him!”[%p]
Lukako races into the shrine office.[%p]
He believes just about everything I say.[%p]
He’s really easy to deal with, unlike my rebellious assistant.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Achoo!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh no, did I catch a cold?”[%p]
Kurisu’s sniffling should keep her too occupied to scold me for awhile.[%p]
Lukako’s father soon appears.[%p]
Lukako is pretty flustered. He’s practically dragging his father behind him.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Hurry, Dad! Hurry!”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Slow down a little. If you rush me, I’m going to fall.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“But the future of mankind is at stake!”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Oh. Well. That’s certainly serious.”[%p]
I’ve met Lukako’s father several times before.[%p]
He’s a gentle, respectable adult. With the exception of how he raised Lukako.[%p]
Apparently, the reason Lukako wears miko garb is because his father requested it. Maybe his dad’s a pervert. No, it’s not like I mean to mock the Shinto priesthood or anything like that.[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Ah, Hououin-kun. It’s been a while. Thank you for always taking care of Luka.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The honor is mine.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...His name isn’t Hououin. It’s Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Oh. Really?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You there, assistant! Stop making things complicated!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m just telling the truth.”[%p]
Tch, what did she come here for?[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Luka told me his name was Hououin. Hmm, maybe Luka was just playing a trick on me. Hahaha.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Th-that’s not it, Dad. Okabe-san is his real name, and Hououin is, umm...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am Hououin.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe Rintaro is the name your parents gave you, right? Are you denying that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just be quiet, Zombie!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Who’s a zombie!?”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Hahaha. It’s great that you all get along.”[%p]
Luka’s dad looks at Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Are you one of Luka’s friends too? Please get along with Luka from now on too.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Um, I’m...”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“As you can see, this child of mine is so delicate.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“C-come on, Dad...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu looks like she’s going to cry for some reason.[%p]
What’s wrong? Is she upset that Luka’s father assumes she’s a friend?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu notices my stare and quickly turns away.[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“So, Hououin-kun. Did you need me for something?”[%p]
That’s right. This is no time for idle chatter.[%p]
This meeting will shape the course of Ragnarok![%p]
The future of mankind is, well, whatever.[%p]
I’m a mad scientist, not some sort of hero.[%p]
I explain to Lukako’s father how I need the IBN 5100.[%p]
And then I ask him if that retro PC was donated to Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
Of course, I don’t disclose any classified information, like how we plan to hack SERN or how this is all related to time machine research.[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“I don’t know if ’donated’ is the right word to use...”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“But an old computer was entrusted to this shrine about nine years ago.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Eh...”[%p]
No way. Really?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s it! That has to be it!”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Please wait here. I’ll go get it.”[%p]
Lukako’s father comes back in about ten minutes.[%p]
His face is bright red, and he’s carrying a large cardboard box.[%p]
His gait is fairly unsteady. I wonder if he’ll be okay.[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Whew, it was hard to dig out. I think this is what you’re looking for.”[%p]
Luka’s dad places the box on the ground and takes a deep breath as he rubs his back.[%p]
Was it that heavy?[%p]
I thank him and take a look inside.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“An IBN 5100...!”[%p]
Inside is a simple computer with an integrated monitor. The monitor is only about as big as a GPS screen.[%p]
I compare it to the IBN 5100 image I got from Shining Finger.[%p]
They look very similar.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ah, look at this.”[%p]
Lukako points to the logo between the [color index="820000"]tape drive[color index="800000"] and the monitor.[%p]
It says “IBN 5100 Portable Computer”.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Muhahaha! MUHAHAHAHA! Finally, I have solved Akiba’s urban legend!”[%p]
This is the phantom PC of Akihabara![%p]
It’s in excellent condition. There’s only a thin layer of dust on it.[%p]
But it looks like we’ll need to plug it in to see if it works.[%p]
Now, the problem is whether Lukako’s father will lend it to me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Urushibara-shi. I’ll be blunt.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“May I borrow this computer?”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Sure.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Seriously!?”[%p]
Is it okay for a priest to just lend property out like that? Items which were donated to the shrine?[%p]
I’ve never heard of anything like that. That’s why I was expecting him to refuse.[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“When this was entrusted to us, the owner said this.”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“’If a young man ever appears and says that he needs this computer no matter what, please lend it to him with my blessings.’”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“I didn’t think it would actually happen. To be honest, I’d forgotten about it entirely until you reminded me.”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“I’m happy to lend it to you, Hououin-kun. But please be sure to return it when you’re done, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course! Thank you!”[%p]
I bow deeply, but in my heart I’m grinning like a madman.[%p]
Heh heh heh, I can’t stop laughing. Things are going better than I anticipated. It’s almost like everything’s being handed to me on a silver platter.[%p]
Now SERN’s secrets will be laid bare.[%p]
We can expose their wicked research, and possibly even gather hints on the creation of a time machine.[%p]
And then, I can complete the first time machine in human history![%p]
Now I have to get the IBN 5100 back to the lab.[%p]
But unfortunately, I don’t have a car to transport it. In fact, I don’t even have a license.[%p]
Same goes for my assistant.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can’t Americans start driving at 16? How come you don’t have a license?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What, something wrong with that? I spend all my time doing research.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re wasting your youth.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I thought so too, until I met you. Now I realize I’m doing just fine.”[%p]
...Touche.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Umm, no fighting please...”[%p]
Lukako’s flustered again.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re a lifesaver, Lukako. Thank your father again for me.”[%p]
Luka’s dad has already returned to the shrine office.[%p]
Lukako nods.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Your father is a lovely man.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh...”[%p]
Lukako and I freeze at my assistant’s nonchalant words.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“M-my father is m-married... a-ad-adultery... is bad!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see, assistant. So you like older men.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, wait! Don’t misunderstand, you two. That’s not what I meant!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I-I won’t give up my father...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“P-please don’t cry...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I just meant I was jealous of how well you get along with your father. That’s all.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh, ah, of course... I’m sorry for the weird misunderstanding! That was so rude of me!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t cry. We’ve resolved the misunderstanding, so it’s all okay.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...but in the depths of your heart lie feelings for Luka’s dad.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Die.”[%p]
Christina turns away.[%p]
I decide to leave it at that. Angering her any further could lead to violence.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako, don’t forget your practice swings with Samidare.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Y-yes sir. I’ll do my best... Umm, El Psy Kongalee...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s Kongroo! Don’t forget it.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m sorry!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey! What kind of lowlife teases a girl?”[%p]
I wouldn’t know.[%p]
Lukako is a guy.[%p]
I ignore Christina and lift up the box with the IBN 5100 inside.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hng! ...Gah, it’s heavy!”[%p]
I can barely get it off the ground.[%p]
I put it down for now.[%p]
Now I know why Luka’s dad was red in the face when he brought this thing in.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Is it that heavy?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Pathetic. It’s only as big as a CRT monitor.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then why don’t you try carrying it? Then you’ll understand.”[%p]
Kurisu sighs, grabs both ends of the cardboard box, and lifts.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wheugh...!”[%p]
She strains with all her might, but gives up without lifting it even a centimeter.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...It’s r-really heavy.”[%p]
She blushes slightly, but still maintains her usual frown.[%p]
My assistant seems to have a strong competitive spirit.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This thing’s gotta weigh like 30 kilos.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Maybe we should’ve borrowed a push cart. Urushibara-san, is there one in the shrine?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Umm, there is one, but actually, it’s broken... I’m sorry.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh. Is there some other place we could borrow--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, we don’t need a push cart.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then how are you going to bring it back? It takes about ten minutes to walk to your run-down lab from here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It may be too heavy for one person, but it’s a different story for two. You and I just need to carry it together. Why else do you think I made you my assistant?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So that’s why...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well, if we carry it together, we might be able to manage, but...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But I refuse.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...huh?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]”I... I said ’no!’” [%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m pretty sure you said ’but I refuse.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sh-shut up. I said no.”[%p]
“But I refuse” is a famous manga quote. Could Kurisu be an @channeler?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The whole reason you made me a lab mem was to ’borrow my knowledge’. From this, it is elementary to derive the following: ’I won’t do physical labor.’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see. Then I guess I have no choice. I’ll do my best to carry it, but...”[%p]
I glance at Lukako.[%p]
He twitches when he notices my look, then timidly raises his hand with tears in his eyes.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um, th-then, I will...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh? You’re going to help? Will you be okay?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yes, I’ll d-do my best.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, Lukako. I shouldn’t make you help me. I can manage by myself.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“But... we’re friends, Okabe-san. I want to help you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, I’ll do it myself.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I-I’ll help you!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Th-then, umm... me too...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please, go ahead.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh? Wha!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Muhahaha! Don’t you know, Christina? This is what you call a Japanese Gag!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You sneaky...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thanks for the backup, Lukako! Now that that’s settled, my assistant will help me carry the computer, so you don’t have to help. Thanks for the offer.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ah, okay... if that’s how it is, then...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now, assistant! Since you volunteered, I won’t let you refuse. Grab hold and heave!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Fine.”[%p]
Kurisu and I lift up the cardboard box.[%p]
The burden’s considerably easier when distributed between two people.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why do we have to be face to face?”[%p]
We’re positioned so that we’re looking at each other.[%p]
But there’s no other way to hold it, so what can you do?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s just go.”[%p]
I start to walk out of the shrine.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey! Stop stop stop! I said stop!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re a noisy one.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t walk forwards. Then I have to walk backwards. Let’s walk sideways.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whatever. Get moving, assistant.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, listen, please, just listen! I can’t walk backwards!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course you can. You’re my assistant.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I appreciate the vote of confidence, but I can’t! I’m asking you to go sideways! No, I’m telling you to go sideways! Sideways! I’m going to fall!”[%p]
