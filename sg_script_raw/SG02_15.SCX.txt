It’s dark by the time we get to the lab.[%p]
It’s normally less than a fifteen minute walk, but since Kurisu kept begging to take breaks, it ended up taking twice as long.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Haah, we finally made it... I’m exhausted...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you didn’t complain so much about every little thing, we would’ve gotten here sooner.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Right back at you. You stopped to take a break at least five times along the way.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s because I wasn’t feeling well...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s just... occasionally, my right arm aches... and when it does, dark destructive impulses overcome my soul--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Shut up, or I’ll tear the peripheral nerves out of that arm.”[%p]
Holy crap. There’s something wrong with this girl![%p]
Rip out my nerves? That’s like something from last year’s [color index="820000"]New-Gen Incidents[color index="800000"]![%p]
Okay, I’ll shut up.[%p]
Let’s bring the IBN 5100 into the lab. The final barrier awaits.[%p]
We have to ascend this rickety building’s narrow staircase.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Shouldn’t you get your friends to help?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re right.”[%p]
I check the window. The lab’s lights are on.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Part-Time Warrior comes out of the Braun Tube Workshop with perfect timing.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If it isn’t Okabe Rintaro. What’cha got there?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph, you want to know? Then I’ll tell you!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wait! If you’re just going to stand and talk, shouldn’t we put the box down first?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-yeah... actually, wait, this will only take a second.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Well? What is it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What if I told you... it’s an IBN 5100?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No way! You found it!? Wow! Way to go, Okabe Rintaro!”[%p]
I wish she’d stop calling me by my full name.[%p]
If she’s going to do that, she should at least call me Hououin Kyouma.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Where was it?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ugh, it’s heavy...”[%p]
Kurisu starts giving in.[%p]
I’m about at my limit too.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s put it down!”[%p]
Kurisu and I place it on the ground gently, so as to not damage the contents.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Haah...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So, where was it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yanabayashi Shrine.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yanabayashi Shrine? You mean like a Shinto shrine?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Why was it there...”[%p]
Then, suddenly, Suzuha looks at Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ah...!”[%p]
She gasps, then approaches Kurisu until they’re close enough to feel each other’s breath.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Y-yes?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Makise Kurisu?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yes...?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
For some reason, she stares at Kurisu with frightful intensity.[%p]
Kurisu narrows her eyes in opposition.[%p]
Wh-what’s going on here? I can’t move a muscle, the air’s so thick with tension.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What is it? Have I done something wrong?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Hmph.”[%p]
Suzuha turns away, and without looking back, disappears into the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Who was that?”[%p]
Now Kurisu demands answers from me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She works part-time at that store.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why was she glaring at me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How should I know? Did you do something to make her angry?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ve never seen her before in my life. How rude.”[%p]
Kurisu picked a fight with me the first time we met too. But that was a hallucination, so I don’t say anything.[%p]
I get Daru and Mayuri to come down and help us, and the four of us carry the IBN 5100 upstairs.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Good work, everyone. With this, we can fight.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Who are you fighting?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“SERN, and the system that rules the world.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If that’s what makes you happy...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Happy? I do not desire happiness. Have you forgotten? I am an insane mad scientist!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What I desire is chaos. The time machine exists to bring chaos to the world. MUHAHAHAHA!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Never mind happiness. You’re like a junkie hypersecreting [color index="820000"]beta endorphins[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin? I don’t want you doing bad things, remember?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But wow! I can’t believe you found one. You make the impossible look easy! That’s why we love you! That’s why we ad--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I certainly don’t admire him.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...Eh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Eh?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh...?”[%p]
For a moment, there is complete silence.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s all thanks to Mayushii!”[%p]
Mayuri, oblivious as always, puffs out her chest with pride.[%p]
But I don’t miss Kurisu’s relieved sigh.[%p]
She keeps dropping manga quotes. Does this mean what I think it means?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Without Mayushii’s info, Okarin would still be lost on the streets of Akiba.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri’s right. She did well this time.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe! Anyway, it’s time for Mayushii to go home.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What about you, Chris-chan? Wanna go together?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thanks. But I’m going to stay here a little longer.”[%p]
Looks like Kurisu’s interested in the IBN 5100 and SERN after all.[%p]
That reminds me. I haven’t filled her in yet.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay. But you should go home before it gets too late.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]”See you tomorrow! Tutturu♪” [%p]
Mayuri waves her hand as she leaves.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now then, Daru. When do you think we can use the IBN 5100 to hack SERN?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm... well...”[%p]
Daru talks as he plugs the IBN 5100’s power adapter into the wall.[%p]
He turns the machine on, and the power supply begins to make a turbulent noise.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wow, it actually turned on.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“First I need to learn how to use this thing. It looks like hooking it up is gonna be a pain.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It might take a while. I can’t play with this thing and search for the server admin’s ID at the same time.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alright. Prioritize the ID search.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If possible, I’d like you to get the IBN 5100 ready to use this month, though.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“There’s still 30 days left this month. It’s not gonna take that long.”[%p]
That’s my super hacka.[%p]
