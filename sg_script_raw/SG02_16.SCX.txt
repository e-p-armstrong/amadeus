[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
I don’t recognize the number, so I decide to ignore the call.[%p]
It could be an Organization assassin trying to lure me into a trap.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m wise to your tricks, fiend!”[%p]
I don’t bother calling back.[%p]
When I enter the courtyard, I see a beautiful girl -- er, boy -- in miko robes sweeping with a bamboo broom.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ah, Oka... Kyouma-san, hello.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Lukako, why don’t you have it?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Huh? Um, are you talking about Demon Sword Samidare?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I thought I told you to carry it at all times!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m sorry, but it gets in the way when I’m cleaning...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you going to do if they attack while you’re cleaning? Nobody’s going to come to your rescue, you know.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Th-that’s true... I’ll be more careful from now on.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By the way, Lukako. I need to talk to your father. Can you go get him?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yes, I can, but, what do you need to talk to him about?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Serious business, critical for the future of mankind.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“The future... of mankind!?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I-I’ll go get him!”[%p]
Lukako rushes into the shrine office.[%p]
He’ll believe just about anything I say.[%p]
Lukako’s father soon appears.[%p]
Lukako is pretty flustered. He’s practically dragging his father behind him.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Hurry, dad! Hurry!”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Slow down a little. If you rush me, I’m going to fall.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“But the future of mankind is at stake!”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Oh. Well. That’s certainly serious.”[%p]
I’ve met Lukako’s father several times before.[%p]
He’s a gentle, respectable adult. With the exception of how he raised Lukako.[%p]
Apparently, the reason Lukako wears miko garb is because his father requested it. Maybe his dad’s a pervert. No, it’s not like I mean to mock the Shinto priesthood or anything like that.[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Ah, Hououin-kun. It’s been a while. Thank you for always taking care of Luka.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The honor is mine.”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Did you need me for something?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]”Th-that’s right...! The future of mankind...![%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“That sounds serious.”[%p]
Luka’s father deflects his son’s panic with a gentle smile.[%p]
Impressive. He knows how to brush someone off without making them feel bad.[%p]
Maybe I should take notes.[%p]
Anyway. I explain to Lukako’s father about how I need an IBN 5100.[%p]
I ask him if there’s one at the shrine.[%p]
Of course, I don’t disclose any classified information, like how we plan to hack SERN or how this is all related to time machine research.[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“I don’t know if ’donated’ is the right word to use...”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“But an old computer was entrusted to this shrine about nine years ago.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Eh...”[%p]
No way. Really?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s it! That has to be it!”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Please wait here. I’ll go get it.”[%p]
Luka’s dad comes back in about 10 minutes.[%p]
His face is bright red, and he’s carrying a large cardboard box.[%p]
His gait is fairly unsteady. I wonder if he’ll be okay.[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Whew, it was hard to dig out. I think this is what you’re looking for.”[%p]
Luka’s dad places the box on the ground and takes a deep breath as he rubs his back.[%p]
Was it that heavy?[%p]
I thank him and take a look inside.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“An IBN 5100...!”[%p]
Inside is a simple computer with an integrated monitor. The monitor is only about as big as a GPS screen.[%p]
I compare it to the IBN 5100 image I got from Shining Finger.[%p]
They look very similar.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ah, look at this.”[%p]
Lukako points to the logo between the [color index="820000"]tape drive[color index="800000"] and the monitor.[%p]
It says “IBN 5100 Portable Computer”.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Muhaha! MUHAHAHA! Finally, I have solved Akiba’s urban legend!”[%p]
This is the phantom PC of Akihabara![%p]
It’s in excellent condition. There’s only a thin layer of dust on it.[%p]
But it looks like we’ll need to plug it in to see if it works.[%p]
Now, the problem is whether Lukako’s father will lend it to me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Urushibara-shi. I’ll be blunt.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“May I borrow this computer?”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Sure.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Seriously!?”[%p]
Is it okay for a priest to just lend property out like that? Items which were donated to the shrine?[%p]
I’ve never heard of anything like that. That’s why I was expecting him to refuse.[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“When this was entrusted to us, the owner said this.”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“’If a young man ever appears and says that he needs this computer no matter what, please lend it to him with my blessings.’”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“I didn’t think it would actually happen. To be honest, I’d forgotten about it entirely until you reminded me.”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“I’m happy to lend it to you, Hououin-kun. But please be sure to return it when you’re done, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course! Thank you!”[%p]
I bow deeply, but in my heart I’m grinning like a madman.[%p]
Heh heh heh, I can’t stop laughing. Things are going better than I anticipated. It’s almost like everything’s being handed to me on a silver platter.[%p]
Now SERN’s secrets will be laid bare.[%p]
We can expose their wicked research, and possibly even gather hints on the creation of a time machine.[%p]
And then, I can complete the first time machine in human history![%p]
Now I have to bring the IBN 5100 back to the lab.[%p]
But unfortunately, I don’t have a car to transport it. In fact, I don’t even have a license.[%p]
I try asking Lukako’s father if he’ll drive it to the lab, but he has a neighborhood assembly to attend, and declines with a smile.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So that means I have to carry it back.”[%p]
Fortunately, the lab is less than a 15 minute walk from here.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It looks pretty heavy...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph. No matter how heavy it may look, it’s still just a computer. I can manage.”[%p]
I try lifting up the cardboard box with the IBN 5100 inside.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huff! ...Gah, it’s heavy!”[%p]
It’ll take everything I’ve got to carry this all the way.[%p]
I put it down for now.[%p]
Now I know why Lukako’s father was red in the face when he carried this thing.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“A-are you okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kuh... why now!?”[%p]
I grab my right wrist.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“My right hand... is aching!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“B-but, that means...!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Umm, umm, I-I’ll perform an exorcism!”[%p]
Lukako turns to go get his miko tools, but I grab his hand to stop him.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait... d-don’t go... I’m still okay...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“B-but Kyouma-san, you look like you’re in pain! Wh-what should I do...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s okay... it’ll stop soon... you don’t need to worry...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But... I have a request. Will you hear me out?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Y-yes, if it’s something I can do!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please help me... carry this box.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh...”[%p]
Lukako’s eyes quickly fill with tears.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“B-but I’m not strong at all...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We can manage... together. You’re the only one I can depend on now.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Kyouma-san...”[%p]
Lukako gazes straight into my eyes, then looks away apologetically.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I don’t know if I can do it...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can do it. I know you can.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...Okay. But, um, if we can take breaks along the way, I’d be happy...”[%p]
That settles it.[%p]
I grab one side of the cardboard box.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alright, Lukako, grab the other side.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... is your arm... okay now?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No. We can’t let our guard down. This might only be temporary.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We need to get this to the lab before I have a relapse.”[%p]
Lukako makes a mad dash to the cardboard box.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’ll do my best! But I’m not confident...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry. I’ll support you.”[%p]
With that said, we lift up the box on the count of three.[%p]
It’s easier than carrying it alone, but it’s still heavy.[%p]
It sure is going to be hard to carry this for 15 minutes.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ugh! I-it’s heavy!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Brace your legs! Let’s keep going. We’ll move sideways, okay? Don’t move forwards or backwards!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Kayyy... Um, sideways, as in left? Right!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Right... no, my right, so your left... go left!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okaayyyyy...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“B-but, my hand, my hand is cramping...”[%p]
Tch, he’s giving in faster than expected![%p]
We haven’t even left the shrine![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Fight, Lukako! And whatever you do, don’t drop it! We’re screwed if it breaks!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ugh, ugghhh...”[%p]
This is going to be tough.[%p]
