It’s dark by the time we get to the lab.[%p]
It’s normally less than a fifteen minute walk, but since we had to stop a few times to let Lukako rest, it ended up taking twice as long.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Haah... haah... we made it...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah... thanks for the help... you’re... a lifesaver...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Phew, really... thanks...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ah, no...”[%p]
Lukako starts fidgeting.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Since you’re my master, Kyouma-san, I’m happy... to be of use to you.”[%p]
He doesn’t wipe the sweat off his brow.[%p]
But despite that, Lukako turns to me with a brave smile as he speaks.[%p]
So cute...[%p]
But he’s a guy.[%p]
It’s so disappointing![%p]
I look up to the second floor to see the lights turned on.[%p]
Let’s get the IBN 5100 into the lab. The final barrier awaits.[%p]
We have to ascend this rickety building’s narrow staircase.[%p]
That’s surely impossible for just Lukako and me.[%p]
Might as well call for help.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Come forth, my servants! By the covenant I command thee, grant me thy power!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“K-Kyouma-san!?”[%p]
The second story window opens when I cry out.[%p]
The face that appears is--[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re so annoying! What is it!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh, I summoned an assistant. What are you doing here?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Who’re you calling an assistant? You wouldn’t pick up your phone, so I’ve been waiting here an hour for you.”[%p]
My phone? That reminds me. Before I went to Yanabayashi Shrine, I got a call from an unknown number.[%p]
So that was her?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hi, Okarin! Huh? Luka-kun’s with you!”[%p]
Mayuri appears behind my assistant.[%p]
Lukako waves to Mayuri. At the same time, the door to the Braun Tube Workshop opens.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hey, Okabe Rintaro. The boss says to quiet down. You’re disturbing the neighbors.”[%p]
Part-Time Warrior appears.[%p]
Well, that’s plenty of help.[%p]
It’s disappointing that they’re all girls, but I’ll compromise for quantity over quality.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Assemble, servants! We have a mission of the utmost secrecy! Come!”[%p]
Obeying my command, Mayuri, my assistant, and Part-Time Warrior all walk over to me.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What’s this?”[%p]
Mayuri peeks inside the cardboard box with great interest.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Wait... you got one?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Indeed I did.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No way! Amazing! Way to go, Okabe Rintaro! Where did you find it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yanabayashi Shrine.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yanbayashi Shrine? You mean, like a Shinto shrine?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What was it doing there...”[%p]
The warrior looks confused for some reason.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh! So that’s why Luka-kun’s with you.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Y-yeah...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What’s this? What’re you talking about?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um, the IBN... two thousand... five thousand... what was it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I got an IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh, that thing you were talking about yesterday.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ah...!”[%p]
For some reason, Suzuha gasps when she sees my assistant.[%p]
And then, she approaches until they’re close enough to feel each other’s breath.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Y-yes?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Makise Kurisu?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yes...?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
For some reason, she stares at Kurisu with frightful intensity.[%p]
Kurisu narrows her eyes and meets Suzuha’s stare.[%p]
Wh-what’s going on here? I can’t move a muscle, the air’s so thick with tension.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What is it? Have I done something to you?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Hmph.”[%p]
Suzuha turns away, and without looking back, disappears into the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Who was that?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, she works part-time at the Braun Tube Workshop. Her name’s Suzu-san!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know.”[%p]
I don’t know about the Suzu-san part, though.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You do?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why was she glaring at me like that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How should I know? Did you do something to make her angry?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ve never seen her before in my life. How rude.”[%p]
Kurisu picked a fight with me the first time we met too. But that was a hallucination, so I don’t say anything.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, help me out here. We’re taking this thing into the lab.”[%p]
Suzuha’s departure decreases the number of helpers, but the four of us should be enough.[%p]
By the time we wrestle the IBN 5100 into the lab, every one of us is out of breath. Daru’s at his computer eating potato chips.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey! Why didn’t you help!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, you didn’t call me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I said all members assemble, didn’t I!?”[%p]
Since Daru didn’t come, the three girls -- err, two girls and one crossdressing boy -- are all worn out.[%p]
Mayuri and Lukako are clearly not cut out for physical labor, and Kurisu did nothing but complain.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Haah, haah... why do I... have to...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So tired...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I can’t walk any more...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Good work, you three.”[%p]
I pick three bananas from the bunch on the table and distribute them among the three worn-out girls.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is my thanks for helping. Eat up.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Thank you! I’m so happy!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But those are Mayushii’s bananas...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That reminds me, Mayuri. It’s thanks to you that I got this IBN 5100. If it weren’t for your information, it would’ve taken forever to find it.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe! Really? I’m glad I was useful.”[%p]
Mayuri happily takes a bite of her banana.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What are you going to use the IBN 5100 for? Yesterday you said something about SERN.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You interested, Christina?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m not Christina, and I’m not interested. If you don’t want to tell me, then I don’t really care.”[%p]
But to me, it looks like she’s dying to know.[%p]
It’s evident by the way she keeps glancing at the cardboard box.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This artifact is needed for the war against SERN.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“War? SERN’s a research institution.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ostensibly, yes.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...What are you trying to do? Depending on the situation, I could turn you over to the police, you know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph, the police? Do you really think a mad scientist like me is afraid of the police? I’ve spent my life on the run from the Organization, a more fearsome enemy than you can possibly imagine.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You can’t be serious. Tell me what you’re trying to do.”[%p]
You know, she’s really pompous for an assistant.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’ll have plenty of time to talk about that later. More importantly, Daru, when do you think we can use the IBN 5100 to hack SERN?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm... well...”[%p]
Daru talks as he plugs the IBN 5100’s power adapter into the wall.[%p]
He turns the machine on, and the power supply begins to make a turbulent noise.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wow, it actually turned on.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“First I need to learn how to use this thing. It looks like hooking it up is gonna be a pain.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It might take a while. I can’t play with this thing and search for the server admin’s ID at the same time.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alright. Prioritize the ID search.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If possible, I’d like you to get the IBN 5100 ready to use this month, though.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“There’s still 30 days left this month. It’s not gonna take that long.”[%p]
That’s my super hacka.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“We’re gonna take off now, okay?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um, pardon the intrusion.”[%p]
The two of them finish their bananas and get ready to leave.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You two did well today. Be proud.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re so full of yourself.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Chris-chan, you not going home? You can walk with us to the station if you want.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thanks. But I’m going to stay here a little longer.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay. See you later! Tutturu♪”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Excuse me.”[%p]
Mayuri and Lukako wave goodbye and head out the door.[%p]
