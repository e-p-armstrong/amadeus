[name]Kurisu[line]“Well?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, what?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m asking for an explanation. What’s this about the IBN 5100 and SERN?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What?”[%p]
I look up. Kurisu is glaring at me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What did you just call me?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I called you O-Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You called me Okabe?”[%p]
I take one step towards Kurisu.[%p]
And she takes a step back.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Time out, time out!”[%p]
Daru tries to hold me back, but I shake him off and take a step closer.[%p]
Kurisu doesn’t step back this time. Without taking her eyes off me, she bites her lip hard and curls her hands into fists.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you just call me [color index="A0140000"]Okabe[color index="800000"]?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I did. Problem?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yes, I’m younger than you, but you insist on calling me by ridiculous names like Christina and Zombie, so I don’t think I need to show you any respect by adding ’-san’, and besides--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s not the problem!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“!!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am not Okabe! I am HOUOUIN KYOUMA! How many times do I have to tell you, Christina!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...God, you’re so full of yourself.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“From now on, call me Hououin. That or Kyouma.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No.”[%p]
Kurisu snaps at me and turns away.[%p]
Are those tears I see in her eyes?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you... crying?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m not crying! It’s not like I was scared of you for a second there or anything, and I definitely wasn’t relieved when you started talking like an idiot again, okay!?”[%p]
She stalks over to the window and stares outside.[%p]
I see her wipe her eyes with the back of her hand. Seems she was crying after all.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, why is my assistant crying?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uh, she said so herself just now.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“All I did was correct her on my name.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Maybe she only acts strong but is actually weak on the inside. That would be pretty moe.”[%p]
Well, whatever. Back to checking mail.[%p]
But I’m thirsty from this hard day’s work. So before that, I take a fresh Dr P out of the fridge.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, aren’t you going to tell me what’s going on?”[%p]
I toss the bottle to Kurisu once she turns around.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Kya!”[%p]
Kurisu tries to catch it, but fails magnificently.[%p]
She picks the bottle up off the floor, then shoots me a glare.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll explain in a second. Drink that while you wait.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Gee, thanks.”[%p]
I need to send a reply to Shining Finger.[%p]
She ended up being no help at all, but I suppose I can’t just say nothing.[%p]
“I got the goods. Over.”[%p]
I send as concise a message as possible.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now then...”[%p]
I turn back to Kurisu, but the reply comes before I can open my mouth.[%p]
Turnaround in less than five seconds. She must have her phone in hand 24/7. That’s the only possible explanation.[%p]
“Gimme”? What nonsense is this?[%p]
“Sorry, but I’m not the owner. I can’t just give it to you.”[%p]
I send that.[%p]
Another instant reply.[%p]
Guh...[%p]
It’s easy to imagine what will happen if I lend it to her.[%p]
She’ll disappear, and I’ll never see the IBN 5100 again.[%p]
“No borrowing either. You can come over to our lab if you want to see it, but no touching.”[%p]
I add the lab’s address and send the mail. No more replies come.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry for the wait, Christina.”[%p]
I look up and see Kurisu drinking the Dr P.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh? You’re a fan of the Doc, I see.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ve lived seven years at its birthplace, after all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Excellent. We’ll make great drinking buddies.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m a minor.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s not what I meant. I meant Dr P drinking buddies.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Is that all you drink?”[%p]
Kurisu shrugs her shoulders and takes another swig, signaling me to talk.[%p]
And so, I explain how Daru and I hacked into SERN.[%p]
And how they’ve already had the LHC in operation for nine years.[%p]
And how they’ve successfully created mini black holes.[%p]
And how it looks like they’re researching time travel.[%p]
And also how they haven’t disclosed any of that to the world.[%p]
Kurisu’s expression grows more and more intense as she listens to the story.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“SERN certainly is acting strange... but how’s the IBN 5100 involved?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“SERN’s database uses an IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Allow me to explain. My trusted Super Hacka, Mister Daru--”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s not super hacka. How many times do I have to tell you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Super Hacker Mister Daru, has hacked into SERN.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Is that okay? Won’t they catch you?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I wouldn’t make a blunder like that.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s not what I meant.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“As a result, we found evidence that those bastards are researching time travel with the LHC.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The LHC?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Seriously. We have the evidence. And guess what? The LHC has been in operation for nine years.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What? Really!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And they’ve successfully generated mini black holes.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No way... Then why haven’t they made an official announcement!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s just it. For some reason, those bastards won’t announce any of it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That the LHC has been operating for nine years. That they’ve successfully created mini black holes. That they’re researching time travel.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Basically, it’s proof that SERN has--”[%p]
Dammit. Another email.[%p]
I’ll start over.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Basically, it’s proof that SERN has something to hide. Can’t you just smell the conspiracy?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t believe in conspiracies, but...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you can prove what you said is real, then I might be surprised. SERN doing time travel research...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ah, but what about the IBN 5100? How is that involved?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“SERN’s database uses--”[%p]
Another email.[%p]
There’s only one person who can send them this fast.[%p]
That mail demon! Didn’t I tell her to give it a rest!?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry. Daru, please continue the explanation.”[%p]
I excuse myself and open the email.[%p]
It’s a reply to my earlier email.[%p]
She’s so impatient.[%p]
Kurisu is glaring at me.[%p]
Better make the reply brief.[%p]
“I got an IBN 5100. I can’t lend it to you, but if you want to see it, you can come to our lab.”[%p]
I send the email after adding the lab’s address, and close my phone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, how far did you get?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Up to the point where SERN’s using IBN 5100 code for their database.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So basically, what that means is--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The only way to decrypt that database is to use an IBN 5100 of our own.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“How do you know that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I have my sources.”[%p]
I don’t drop Titor’s name. I have no doubt this genius girl would laugh if I did.[%p]
Kurisu puts a finger to her lip, deep in thought.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Setting the IBN 5100 and such aside...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I want to see proof that SERN’s really doing that sort of research.”[%p]
True, we didn’t get any definite proof of SERN’s time travel research last time we hacked them.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru. Will it take much longer to find the server admin’s account?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Actually, I was just thinking about doing that. It shouldn’t take more than half a day, I guess.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There you go.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I’ll wait until then.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’ll wait? It’s already getting dark. Why not go home for tonight and come back tomorrow morning?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No thanks. I’ll wait. I want to know as soon as possible, even if it’s just a microsecond sooner.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh, that’s the spirit. You’re already fascinated by the conspiracy. You can’t help but want to know what lies at the heart of SERN.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If what you guys are saying is true... then this isn’t something to joke about.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“SERN is the world’s top research institution. If they’re doing secret experiments without publishing their results...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“They’re making fools of scientists the world over.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s only if it’s true, though.”[%p]
She finishes by emphasizing that point again.[%p]
Doesn’t look like she believes us.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, Daru. I’ll leave it to you.”[%p]
According to Daru’s research, the IBN 5100 weighs 25 kilos. For now, we’ll leave it on the shelf in the development room.[%p]
We carry the cardboard box to the room, half dragging it.[%p]
Kurisu follows.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Can you show me the PhoneWave?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Indeed I can. Want to experiment?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You haven’t been able to send another email to the past yet, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Do you know why?”[%p]
I can only shake my head.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Let’s run some tests.”[%p]
Kurisu looks around the development room.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]”Man. You have a ton of junk.” [%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not junk!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Since you’re new to the Future Gadget Laboratory, I’ll explain. These are the glorious fruits of our science: the Future Gadgets!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Future Gadgets 1-7 are stored here. The PhoneWave, with which you are already familiar, is Gadget Number 8.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Future Gadgets, huh...”[%p]
Kurisu casually picks Future Gadget 4: Moad Snake up from the shelf and stares at it.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey. Isn’t this... a weapon?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Future Gadget No. 4: Moad Snake, designed after a claymore landmine, is an instant humidifier.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“How confusing.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Insert water and turn the power on, and in mere seconds, it generates a thick cloud of steam.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So it’s junk. I thought so.”[%p]
Kurisu sighs and returns Moad Snake to the shelf.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m borrowing this.”[%p]
Without waiting for a reply, she grabs Daru’s never-worn lab coat from the shelf and puts it on gallantly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whoa!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s just not right without a lab coat.”[%p]
Overcome with emotion, I seize Kurisu’s hand and grasp it firmly.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Assistant! You [color index="A0140000"]get it[color index="800000"], don’t you!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“G-get what? Let go!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you’re gonna do science, you need a lab coat! Right!?”[%p]
I told Daru over and over, but he wouldn’t wear one.[%p]
But my assistant is different. She put it on before I even said anything![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I knew you were meant for this, Christina! You’re the best assistant a mad scientist could ask for!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t know if that’s supposed to be a compliment, but it’s coming off as an insult. Now let go!”[%p]
She shakes off my hand and turns her back to me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m giving you that lab coat to commemorate your joining the lab. Don’t worry. It’s never been worn.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Or maybe this fateful encounter between you and that lab coat was decided by destiny long ago. Daru not wearing it was just another inevitability. This is the choice of Steins--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Shut up so we can start the experiment.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu thrusts both hands into her lab coat’s pockets, then bends down to look at the time machine now placed underneath the table.[%p]
The previous experiment broke the table and even left a hole in the floor.[%p]
There’s a danger that will happen again if we successfully reproduce the discharge phenomenon, so unfortunately, we’ll have to leave it on the floor for now.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...So you haven’t tampered with the microwave at all?”[%p]
I point to the X68000. There’s code on the screen.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s in terminal mode now. We can change the factory settings like this, make the microwave do things its manufacturer never intended.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“How was it set when the discharge phenomenon occurred?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nothing out of the ordinary. It was at factory settings.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hmm.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ll take a banana.”[%p]
The bunch of bananas only has three bananas left.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Those are Mayuri’s.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh, so I don’t need your permission, then. I’ll go buy new bananas tomorrow.”[%p]
Kurisu takes one banana from the bunch, squats down, and places it inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change). She begins to type on her phone.[%p]
She pushes send, and the PhoneWave (name subject to change) begins to turn backwards.[%p]
After 120 seconds, the chime rings.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Nothing happened.”[%p]
The banana’s still in the microwave, un-gelified.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ow!”[%p]
Kurisu yelps as she tries to take out the banana, and quickly draws back her hand.[%p]
She starts blowing on her fingers.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s hot.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Meaning the microwave functioned normally.”[%p]
This proves that the hidden function Mayuri found wasn’t a “freezing function.” But we knew that already.[%p]
Undaunted, Kurisu throws in a new banana, and once again begins reverse rotation for 120 seconds.[%p]
But the second banana warms up too.[%p]
We can’t reproduce the gelification phenomenon, much less send mail to the past.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What does this mean...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I guess what happened earlier was an irregularity after all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t know if it’s an irregularity or not, but we ought to investigate the cause.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I agree.”[%p]
We agree for once.[%p]
But Kurisu’s motives and my motives are probably the exact opposite.[%p]
My assistant here wants to disprove my theory that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is, in fact, a time machine.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In the previous experiment...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“After spending 120 seconds in the PhoneWave (name subject to change), the banana teleported back to the bunch gelified. We should consider that it returned to its state 120 seconds before.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wrong. If it returned to its state 120 seconds before, it wouldn’t be gelified.”[%p]
So she wants to say that because it was gelified, it didn’t travel back in time.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The chicken returned to its frozen state without gelifying.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That logic is dubious. Sure it ended up frozen, but did you examine the possibility that it might have gelified first?”[%p]
No... I didn’t.[%p]
I think Mayuri ate the refrozen chicken.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Salt didn’t gelify.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You mean nothing changed.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“After the discharge phenomenon occurred last time, we spent all night experimenting with cabbage, radishes, rice, konjac, melon bread, [color index="820000"]Crunchy-kun[color index="800000"], and cup noodles. Nothing happened.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The same thing with liquids. On that day, our success rate took a 180 degree turn.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Before the discharge phenomenon, everything succeeded. After the discharge phenomenon, everything failed.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Is the microwave storing electricity?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You said that gelified objects became fractal structured, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Salt has a simple structure by nature, so maybe that had an effect. But how could electricity be related...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Here, we should think under the assumptions of time travel theory.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No. It’s not good to start thinking from the conclusion.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’ve already had several successful experiments. You can’t deny that.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m not especially concerned whether this thing is a time machine or not.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“To begin with, it’s physically impossible for this tiny little microwave to produce energy equivalent to the big bang.”[%p]
Kurisu frowns deeply.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We can’t reproduce the discharge phenomenon, nor the fractalization. There should be a reason why.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We haven’t changed our methods. We haven’t changed the settings. We haven’t changed the experimental subjects either. There must be some other variable.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe it’s the one who observes it.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What do you mean by that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Quantum theory. The observer is an important element to the experiment.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There were four of us here when the discharge phenomenon occurred last time. But before that, it occurred when Hashida-san was alone.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Each time fractalization occurred, there were either two or three people observing.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You and I each saw both phenomena.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In other words, the conditions haven’t changed.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In that case...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hmmm...”[%p]
There must be some other variable.[%p]
It’s on the tip of my tongue.[%p]
Then I hear a rumbling sound from Kurisu’s stomach.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hungry?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sh-shut up! I haven’t eaten anything since lunch.”[%p]
Kurisu turns away as she looks at her watch.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s already 8?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just eat a banana. But only one of the two we just warmed. They are, after all, the fruit of our experiments.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Or you could take something from our stock of cup noodles.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t want any? Well, since you have lived in America for so long, I guess you’d prefer fast food instead--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Cup noodles.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ll have cup noodles.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Cup noodles!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What flavors?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s soy sauce flavor and chicken flavor.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Chicken.”[%p]
She seems in the mood to eat.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Also... do you have a fork?”[%p]
