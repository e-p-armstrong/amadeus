It’s past midnight.[%p]
At 8 o’clock, the two of us silently ate cup noodles and warm bananas -- Daru said he didn’t want any -- and ever since then, we’ve been examining the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
I’ve mainly focused on the terminal mode settings through the X68000.[%p]
The programs Daru wrote are all [color index="820000"]Wizard[color index="800000"]-class though, so I can’t understand most of them.[%p]
Kurisu’s been examining the AC adapter and the lab’s electrical switchboard for a while. Though we stopped her when she tried to disassemble them.[%p]
It’s early morning, and she still shows no sign of leaving.[%p]
Where is she staying anyway?[%p]
She’s been in Japan for one or two months, and she did say she was going back to America this month.[%p]
The trains aren’t running this late, so I guess she might not be able to leave even if she wants to.[%p]
But in that case, why didn’t she leave before the trains stopped?[%p]
Don’t tell me she plans to stay!?[%p]
No girls have ever stayed over at the lab. Mayuri has a curfew, so she always goes back home to Ikebukuro. Daru and I frequently stay here, though. It’s not an exaggeration to say we live here half the time.[%p]
Maybe it’s normal for American girls to stay overnight in labs.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina, is it okay to stay here this late? Perhaps you should contact your family.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No need.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? Do your parents let you do whatever you want?”[%p]
Kurisu turns to me and sighs.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I haven’t seen my father in seven years. My mother is in America. I’m living in a hotel right now. Understand?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...!”[%p]
Living in a hotel?[%p]
Well, true, renting an apartment for just a month is absurd, but--[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You damn celebrity! If you’re American, then you should at least use a motel instead of a hotel, right!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m not American, and there aren’t any motels in the heart of Tokyo.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What sort of hotel?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What do you mean? It’s a normal hotel in Ochanomizu.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ochanomizu? Then you can walk there from here, can’t you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sure.”[%p]
I see. That’s why she’s so flexible with her schedule.[%p]
I finally understand.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, tell me about your father.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sorry?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You said you haven’t seen him in seven years?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why do you care about my father?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re the one who mentioned him. Isn’t that basically a hidden message saying ’please give me some advice about my father, please’?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re crazy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You are my assistant! And I can’t let my assistant have any worries. So tell me everything that’s on your mind!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu pouts and says no more.[%p]
Instead, she glares at the circuit box on the wall.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I have nothing to say to you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, I know!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your father was a hero, but then he fell to evil and now he wears a black mask and cape and goes ’heeeee koohhh’, right!? And in the future, you two are destined to fight and--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
I think I heard Kurisu’s teeth grind.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Y-you’re really mad at me, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t make fun...”[%p]
Kurisu doesn’t look me in the eye, but her low voice tells me how mad she is.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Of people’s family issues like that. You’re trampling on my heart.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Could her father situation be a landmine?[%p]
Maybe I should apologize.[%p]
I try to think of the words, but before I can say anything--[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hell yeahhhhhhh!”[%p]
Daru’s war cry echoes through the lab.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you get it!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Mission complete.”[%p]
Daru shows his white teeth in a wide grin as he gives a thumbs up.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I got the server admin’s ID and password. Now we can peep as much as we want, hyahoohh!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And the IBN 5100 database?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s separate, duh. The server admin’s unrelated.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I mean, it’s a database with normally unreadable code, so there’s a limit on who can access it. Doesn’t look like even the lab director can access it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There are positions higher than that?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“There’s something called the SERN Executive Council.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm... So they call it a council, eh?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What about it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s a fitting name for our enemy!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu looks at me coldly.[%p]
Whatever. Let’s leave the IBN 5100 database for another day.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Run a search for data on time travel research.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okey-dokey. That Z Program we saw last time was suspicious, wasn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That, and the Jellyman’s Report.”[%p]
We couldn’t get concrete information on either before.[%p]
Kurisu stares holes into the monitor.[%p]
Her angry expression has disappeared.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Look carefully. And burn it into your eyes. The proof of SERN’s actions, its deceit upon the world.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh yeah, baby. Found the LHC project supervisor.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The supervisor... that’s a pretty important post.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Right now, we’re peeking inside his computer.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Z Program, Z Program... hmm...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Z obviously stands for jelly ([color index="A0140000"]zerii[color index="800000"])!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Jelly starts with J. J-E-L-L-Y.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Pfft, careless mistake. So uncool.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ahem! What I meant to say is that there’s no way it would have such a simple name. The name’s hiding something important. There has to be a double meaning!”[%p]
Daru, who’s been searching through the log, suddenly stops.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Got it!”[%p]
He displays a graphic on the monitor.[%p]
It looks like a scan of a very old paper document.[%p]
The letterhead reads Z PROGRAM: TOP SECRET.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The program began... in 1973.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When was SERN formed?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“1954.”[%p]
I asked Daru, but Kurisu answers instead, her tone flat.[%p]
I thought that maybe SERN was formed with the Z Program in mind, but ’54 means my guess was off.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When was the IBN 5100 put on market?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“1975.”[%p]
So maybe that’s why the IBN 5100 was central to SERN’s operations.[%p]
The years match, after all.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]No, that’s wrong.[%e]
It can’t be something as stupidly simple as that.[%p]
There has to be a worldwide conspiracy involved.[%p]
Maybe IBN hid their proprietary programming language in the IBN 5100 for the sole purpose of its use in SERN’s Z Program.[%p]
IBN and SERN are co-conspirators.[%p]
And both of them are being manipulated from the shadows by an even larger organization.[%p]
Yeah, that’s way more interesting.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Ugh, a JPEG? Come on! I can’t copypaste this.”[%p]
Daru mutters some complaint.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hmmm, the text isn’t in French...”[%p]
What’s on-screen right now looks like English.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Actually, there’s French, Dutch, and German versions too. The content looks the same, though.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...’SERN’s purpose heading into the 21st Century shall be to establish control over space and time, thereby to enable the destruction of extant history and the creation of an everlasting Utopia,”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“ruled by the Committee, that encompasses the entirety of past and future events.’”[%p]
Kurisu suddenly starts speaking at a stilted clip.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, right! Makise-shi can do English!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Way to go, assistant! Your study abroad in America was all for the sake of today, wasn’t it!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Of course not. Stop assigning people roles in your fantasy world.”[%p]
Daru relinquishes his chair, allowing Kurisu to sit in front of the computer.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’In order to maintain this project’s secrecy, and to allow its name to remain relevant in changing circumstances, we designate it the Z Program.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Z, like the Greek Omega or the Cyrillic Ya.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’It is forbidden to assign any meaning to this name or to seek in it significance beyond the project itself. Negative returns are predicted should this edict be violated.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’The Z Program is a top secret project spanning international borders. Like electromagnetic wave research, it has been approved for top priority funding by the Committee of 300.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Henceforth, all other research performed by SERN shall function to keep the Z Program’s existence secret.’”[%p]
I guess Kurisu’s reading the preface to a document.[%p]
It’s getting rather dull.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is there anything specific about what exactly the Z Program is?”[%p]
Daru types on the keyboard from the side, bringing up another window.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hmm... ah... here.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This... can’t be!”[%p]
Kurisu bends forward and stares wide-eyed at the words on the screen.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What is it?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’The purpose of the Z Program is to perform time-space displacement experiments by means of high-energy proton-proton collisions.’”[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]Time-space displacement experiments.[%p]
[margin top="38"][center]In other words...[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Time travel!”[%p]
I have to struggle to keep from shouting.[%p]
I quickly run over to the window and close it.[%p]
It might make it hotter inside, but it would be worse if people outside overheard us.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No way... it was true?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re telling me they’ve been deceiving the world for nearly 40 years?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just as I suspected. A great shadow lurks behind SERN. Most likely the Organization, or one of its puppets.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What Organization, you chuunibyou nutjob? At least try to be serious some of the time.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph, don’t be ridiculous. My words are always grounded in truth.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Anyway, shouldn’t it be ’the Committee’ instead of ’the Organization’? That’s what it says here.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“[color index="820000"]The Committee of 300[color index="800000"]? I don’t think they mean SERN’s Executive Council. What are they talking about?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The world is full of lies. It’s not as beautiful as you think.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Listen, Okarin...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am listening. The Committee of 300 is the dark power that controls every secret society, every government, every multinational corporation.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re making things up again.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s the truth. Google it if you don’t believe me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Until now, the human race, for all its accomplishments, has never been able to overcome the barrier called time.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The technology of time travel, which can break through that barrier, will change the course of human history. Literally.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“As it was when we split the atom, this forbidden fruit has the potential to grant us godlike power. Not a man exists who can resist its temptation.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And naturally, all those with power will use any means at their disposal to obtain it. Human morality is naught but a joke to those who would stand with the gods.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Understand, Christina?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Wow. That was quite a speech.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Since you seem to know so much about it, does that mean you’re aiming for godhood too?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What Hououin Kyouma desires is the destruction of all who would call themselves gods, the collapse of their hateful System, and a glorious new age of Chaos. Muhahaha!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m not asking Hououin. I’m asking Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I... I am Hououin!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In other words, you don’t have your own reason.”[%p]
Damn you, assistant. How dare you attack my very identity?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Forget about him, Makise-shi. Please keep reading.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru! What do you mean forget about me?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m tired of listening to conspiracy theories. I’m more interested in the Z Program than in your delusions.”[%p]
I told you, they’re not delusions, and they’re not “theories”...[%p]
But Daru does have a point.[%p]
Our top priority now is to expose the dark side of the international research organization known as SERN.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Continue, assistant.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“At least show respect when you’re asking a favor...”[%p]
Though huffing out complaints, Kurisu obediently goes back to translating.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Umm...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Stage 1: Construction and implementation of the Large Hadron [color index="820000"]Collider[color index="800000"].’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Over the past half century, beginning with the Proton Synchrotron completed in 1959, particle accelerator technology has reached the point where standardized results may be obtained.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Stage 2: Implementation and testing of lifter technology.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’The formation of more than two artificial localized singularities, as well as the formation of Kerr black holes, will become possible when this stage is complete.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’In order to hide the program’s true goal, it is necessary to intentionally leak misinformation regarding the formation of black holes.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Stage 3: Animal experimentation.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Stage 4...”[%p]
Kurisu stops talking.[%p]
She takes a deep breath, then finally mutters angrily.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Human experimentation.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...For real?”[%p]
A chill runs up my spine.[%p]
I admit it. Some part of me still saw this as a game.[%p]
I was elated to discover that an institution as respected as SERN was actually doing time travel research.[%p]
After all, we ourselves had succeeded -- whether by chance or design -- in producing our own time travel phenomenon.[%p]
I thought that maybe we could beat SERN to the first functional time machine design.[%p]
And wouldn’t that be something?[%p]
But now...[%p]
Just like I said to Kurisu, the world is full of lies. Morals are meaningless.[%p]
Was it really okay for us to get involved in this?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“H-hey, Okarin. Remember when we hacked in before? I’m pretty sure that email we read said this...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Result: Error. Human is dead, mismatch. For details, see the Jellyman’s Report...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Someone... died?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Could that have something to do with... human experimentation?”[%p]
My throat goes dry.[%p]
Cold sweat seeps through my brow. And it’s not because of the heat.[%p]
Kurisu and Daru are waiting for me to speak.[%p]
Are they entrusting the decision to me?[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]I ask myself.[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]Is this really okay?[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]Are you sure?[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]There’s no turning back.[%e]
True, but can I live with myself if I ignore this conspiracy?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru... look up the Jellyman’s Report.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Really?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Really. But first, Christina.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You should leave.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why are you suddenly--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The Jellyman’s Report... it just gives me a bad feeling. Once we see it, we can no longer return to our normal lives.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re a genius. You’re already published, for crying out loud. There’s no need to throw away your promising future.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you worried about me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course I am. You are my assistant, after all.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I keep telling you, I’m not your assistant.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thanks for your concern. But I’m not leaving. We need to expose this truth to the world.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No! It’s too dangerous.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You chickening out?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’re powerless against this conspiracy. One wrong move, and they’ll have us erased.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But still--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This isn’t a game! I’m not joking here.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Fine. I won’t tell anyone.”[%p]
Though her expression shows she still doesn’t agree, she finally submits.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But I’m not leaving. It’ll keep me awake at night.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You won’t regret this?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I won’t.”[%p]
She declares firmly.[%p]
I don’t know if it’s her competitive spirit, or if it’s her bravery, or if she’s just ignorant to the ways of the world.[%p]
But it doesn’t look like I can persuade her to back down.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What about you, Daru? Prepared?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, I am a super hacker.”[%p]
He’s comfortable even in this situation.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And with my skills, they’ll never know we were there.”[%p]
That settles it.[%p]
It’s good that Mayuri’s not here. I can’t get her involved.[%p]
I look Daru and Kurisu in the eye.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alright... let’s begin.”[%p]
Kurisu gives the seat to Daru.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Henceforth, this shall be known as Operation [color index="820000"]Laegjarn’s Chest[color index="800000"]!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why Norse mythology?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Is that Norse mythology? Because it’s cool, I guess.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, what is it with men and military terms...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, begin the operation!”[%p]
He soon finds the Jellyman’s Report.[%p]
It required a second password authentication, which Daru broke through easily.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Ready? I’m opening it.”[%p]
Daru looks at me and Kurisu.[%p]
I wet my parched lips and nod.[%p]
The air in the lab suddenly seems thicker.[%p]
Unable to escape through the closed window, it surrounds us with an oppressive heat.[%p]
Daru wipes the sweat off his forehead with a handkerchief, then timidly presses the enter key.[%p]
The file opens.[%p]
At first glance, it looks like a resume.[%p]
There’s a photograph on the top right.[%p]
The top left has name, age, height, weight, and other information.[%p]
In the center is a long string of English text.[%p]
Underneath that, there’s something attached, like a scan of a newspaper clipping with a black and white photo.[%p]
And then I know.[%p]
I know exactly what the “Jellyman” in “Jellyman’s Report” means.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Jellyman’s Report 10’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Subject: James McCarthy, Age: 31, American’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Z Program Stage 4, Date of Experiment: 2005-01-28 T13:05’”[%p]
Kurisu bends over Daru’s shoulder, reading the contents out loud.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.’”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That again...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’It is believed that due to infinite compression by supergravity, the subject could not endure passage through the singularity inside the Kerr black hole.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’April 3, 1921. New York City. An unidentified man was discovered dead in an alley off Union Square. The right half of his body was embedded in a nearby wall.’”[%p]
It sounds like Kurisu is reading the newspaper article at the end.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’The man’s body...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...was completely gelified.’”[%p]
