The ticking of the clock is like a hammer inside my head.[%p]
It’s past 2 AM.[%p]
The window is closed, and the lab is silent but for the humming of the computer.[%p]
We stare at the gruesome image displayed on the monitor, speechless.[%p]
I was right. We’re in too deep.[%p]
I half expect guys in black suits and sunglasses to kick down the door and drag us off to a secret military prison.[%p]
Better make sure the door’s locked.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What’s going on here?”[%p]
Daru breaks the silence with a disbelieving whisper.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“They... gelified someone?”[%p]
Upon hearing the familiar word ’gelified’, I reflexively look at the bunch of bananas placed next to the computer.[%p]
There’s only one banana left.[%p]
We didn’t have a single successful experiment today, so none of them were gelified.[%p]
But I don’t think this is a mere coincidence.[%p]
The gelified bananas produced by the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and the gelified corpses produced by SERN’s experiments.[%p]
They seem identical in nature.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“They’re experimenting on people...”[%p]
Kurisu speaks calmly despite her grim expression.[%p]
She doesn’t even avert her eyes from the gruesome image.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And this means they’ve created a time machine, doesn’t it? Even if it’s not perfect.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Eh...?”[%p]
I’m still in shock, so I don’t quite grasp the meaning of Kurisu’s words.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This New York Times article is from 1921.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“90 years ago...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Look.”[%p]
Kurisu points to part of the black and white photograph, her finger shaking slightly.[%p]
The gelified corpse of a man. She’s pointing to his shoulder, which has writing on it. Perhaps it was printed on his clothes. It’s fused onto the gelified body, but you can somehow manage to read it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“SERN...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So... SERN used the LHC to send someone back to 1921?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Looks like they failed to keep him alive, though.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is this the only report?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“No, there’s more. Looks like... 14 people in total.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“More Jellymen? That means more gelified people... more victims of human experimentation...”[%p]
I swallow hard.[%p]
I’m awfully thirsty.[%p]
I take a cold Dr P out of the fridge and wet my throat.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Show me the others.”[%p]
Daru pulls up another report.[%p]
Without being told to, Kurisu begins translating out loud.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Jellyman’s Report 9.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Subject: Dan Strayski, Age: 26, Canadian.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2004-9-6 T 14:10.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The newspaper clipping... I think it’s in French. I can’t read it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can read the date, though. January 31, 2001.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The location is... Pau, France, I guess.”[%p]
2001. That’s fairly recent.[%p]
A pretty big difference from James McCarthy, who jumped nearly 90 years back to 1921.[%p]
Daru calls up a machine translation, giving us the following.[%p]
[margin top="152"]January 31, 2001.[linebreak]Collapsed male corpse discovered in forest outside Pau, France.[linebreak]Its left foot was fused to a tree trunk, and the body had gelified.[%e]
Daru goes to the next report.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Jellyman’s Report 8.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Subject: Linda Hill, Age: 25, British’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2004-2-15 T 13:45’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Results: Error. Human is Dead. Mismatch.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’October 2, 1972. The gelified body of a woman was discovered on the streets of Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu, India.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’There were signs that the body had been run over by a car.’”[%p]
Daru goes to the next page.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Jellyman’s Report 7.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Subject: Michael Lang, Age: 33, German’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2002-10-8 T 13:28’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Results: Error. Human is dead. Mismatch.’”[%p]
The article clipping is written in Japanese.[%p]
Looks like a pre-war newspaper.[%p]
[margin top="152"]“May 24, 1936,[linebreak]The corpse of what is believed to be a gelified human was discovered at the base of Mt. Hiei in Kyoto.[linebreak]It was in a damaged state, possibly from having slid down the slope.”[%e]
It even happened in Japan. I’ve never heard this story before.[%p]
It was pre-war, though, so I guess someone born in the 90s like me would have no way of knowing about it.[%p]
Next page.[%p]
The picture shows a beach, beautiful but for the jellyfish-like body lying on the sand. It must have washed ashore. [%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Jellyman’s Report 6.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Subject: Mark Hughes, Age: 30, American’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Z Program 4, Date of Experiment: 2002-8-23 T 12:52’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Result: Error. Human is Dead. Mismatch.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]”’On July 1, 1985, a strange body washed ashore on the coast of Streymoy, Faroe Islands.’” [%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’It appeared to be the body of an adult male, but its flesh was soft like that of a jellyfish. Some of the island’s inhabitants believe that it was the body of a merman.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’The inscription ’SERN’ was found near the body’s shoulder, but SERN denies any involvement.’”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Keep looking?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve seen enough.”[%p]
There are 14 of these people?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The sites are spread throughout the world. What can we deduce from this?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They must have sent them to those places.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t think so. It’s too random.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“There was something about Kerr black holes and gravity, right? Isn’t that the cause?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It is believed that due to infinite compression by supergravity, the subject could not endure passage through the Kerr black hole’s singularity.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s what it said.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What’s a Kerr black hole? Is it different from a regular black hole?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s a theoretical black hole with a rotating singularity. Their existence hasn’t been proven yet. Not that there’s any way to prove one exists.”[%p]
Kerr black hole. Where have I heard that term before?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s right... John Titor!”[%p]
Titor said his time machine used Kerr black holes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“According to Titor, SERN finished their time machine in 2034. And then Titor himself came from 2036.”[%p]
It makes sense for Titor and SERN to be using the same time travel technology.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu closes her eyes in deep thought.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Creating Kerr black holes? That’s insane. If you screw up, it could swallow the Earth... and besides, Kerr black holes are just a theoretical construct.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If Titor’s predictions are a reality, then that means the LHC worst case scenario video on [color index="820000"]MewTube[color index="800000"] was right.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I don’t know about Titor’s predictions, but I’ve seen the [color index="820000"]problem video[color index="800000"] before. It was on the news two or three years ago.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The gravitational forces inside a black hole are unbelievably powerful. It’s certainly possible that passing through one could allow time displacement, but there’s no way a human could do that and come out alive.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That must be how these people got gelified.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It wouldn’t just gelify you. It would tear you apart particle from particle. That’s what a black hole does.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Before we discuss this, shouldn’t we look through the rest of their time machine research?”[%p]
Daru’s already started pulling up new documents.[%p]
I’m suddenly afraid.[%p]
Is it okay to keep hacking SERN like this?[%p]
Should I stop him?[%p]
I’m the one who asked him to do it, but things have gotten serious now.[%p]
But at the same time, irresistible curiosity wells up inside me.[%p]
Time travel is becoming a reality.[%p]
I want to know that it’s true. I can’t stop now.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Here we go! There’s a file in the Z Program that explains time travel theory.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That was pretty easy to find. SERN should have better security.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Their security’s fine. I’m just too good.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru is my Favorite Right Arm.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I thought he was your super hacka.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hacker!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So what does it say, Christina?”[%p]
This is in English too, so I have no choice but to rely on my assistant.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Umm... can you give me some time to read it?”[%p]
Kurisu’s eyes dart left and right across the lines.[%p]
Her earlier reluctance has vanished. It looks like she’s as curious as I am.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No way... but this is...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Is Titor really...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you muttering about? Tell me what it says.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Oh, right.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You know, this feels like one big joke.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s almost the same. The same as Titor’s theory.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Basically...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The LHC smashes protons together at 99.9999991% the speed of light.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“By doing so, they compress a mass of 10[⁻²⁴]kg into an extremely tiny space of 10[⁻¹⁹]m.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“In Japanese please. Three lines max.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“A small mass.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thrust into a narrow space.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“With great force.”[%p]
That explanation’s too vague.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That explanation’s too erotic!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Huh? What part of it is erot--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Ah!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“H-Hashida, you pervert!!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Sounds like you have a pretty good imagination yourself.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I-I’m not like you!”[%p]
Her blushing cheeks make her denial less than effective.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t listen to this fool, Christina. Continue.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...ugh.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Uh, what were we talking about?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Thrusting with great force.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Proton compression.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Right. Successful compression generates a micro-singularity, which--”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“A micro singularity? Not a mini black hole?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Same thing, essentially. A singularity is the core of a black hole.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This process generates a black hole with two micro-singularities.”[%p]
A black hole with two cores?[%p]
Like a cowlick with two hairs? No, I don’t think that’s it...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Explain with cute girls.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Fine. Say there are two cute girls, Mic-chan and Cro-chan.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Sisters are moe. Haah, haah.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“By feeding Mic-chan and Cro-chan electrons, you can make them do whatever you want.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Electric shock torture? This some sort of [color index="820000"]eroge[color index="800000"]?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So you force them to rotate at an extremely high velocity.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And then, theoretically, Mic-chan and Cro-chan transform into Magical Girl ’Ring Singularity’.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Cue [color index="820000"]stock transformation scene[color index="800000"]. Got it.”[%p]
Well, it looks like these two have found a common wavelength.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The resulting black hole exhibits what’s called the Kerr effect.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What are Kerr black holes anyway? You said they spin, but what does that mean?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Exactly what it sounds like.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]”But don’t black holes usually spin? I mean, there’s a whirlpool around the hole, right?” [%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The part that looks like it’s spinning is just the surrounding matter being sucked into the black hole.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“A black hole is just a point where extreme mass causes gravitational collapse. Everything falls towards it.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Since it’s only a point, it doesn’t spin.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“ A Kerr black hole has a ring at its center, not a point.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Think of it like this. Once transformed into magical girls, Mic-chan and Cro-chan’s hearts spin like a ring inside their bodies, which is impossible for normal people.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...I’ll pass on the guro.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Before, you said that such a black hole’s existence would be impossible to prove. What did you mean?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“A black hole has what’s called an [color index="820000"]event horizon[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Once you pass the event horizon, time and space switch places.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Time and space switch places?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Right now, we can move freely through space and into the future, but we can’t move even one minute into the past. That becomes reversed.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“On the other side of the event horizon, moving freely through space becomes impossible, while moving freely through time becomes possible.”[%p]
I can’t even imagine what that’s like.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Since unrestricted spatial movement is impossible, you can never escape a black hole.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“For example, if Okabe jumped into a black hole, time for him would stretch to infinity.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Since light cannot escape, human eyes cannot see the other side of the event horizon.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Observing a black hole from the outside is impossible, so nothing about the inside can be proven.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There is an exception, however. This exception is vital when you use a Kerr black hole for time travel.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Get to the point.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The Kerr black hole’s ring singularity. Since it’s spinning, it has angular momentum.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Like I said, in Japanese please.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Didn’t I already explain how the core spins? Just think of that as having momentum.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you keep giving Mic-chan and Cro-chan electrons, they’ll rotate faster and faster.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And when their angular momentum exceeds a certain threshold, the event horizon will disappear, and the singularity will become a [color index="820000"]naked singularity[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“N-naked? You mean the magical girl costumes expose a lot of skin, right? When does the anime adaptation air?”[%p]
Kurisu and I ignore Daru’s nonsense.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Naked, you mean it becomes observable.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“When the event horizon disappears, there’s no more reason for time and space to change places. Meaning that you can enter a naked singularity without being trapped.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And then the existence of the naked singularity allows the principle of causality to be violated and the general theory of relativity to fail.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The laws of physics are broken!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“C-can such a thing exist?”[%p]
The negation of the theory of relativity and the principle of causality means serious paradoxes can occur. Didn’t Kurisu say that earlier?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Nothing in principle stops Kerr black holes from existing. It seems inconsistent, but the math never lies.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Since the principle of causality fails, it would be possible to travel to the past by entering a naked singularity.”[%p]
John Titor said the same thing. So Titor’s time machine is using SERN’s technology.[%p]
But Titor’s time machine was compact, small enough to fit into a car.[%p]
The LHC is 27 kilometers long, but they managed to get it down to travel size in just 24 years.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“One thing I don’t understand is how they inject electrons into the singularity.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Look. This is a picture of the LHC, but there’s strange equipment installed at the proton collision site.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It looks like they call it a ’lifter’, but... just what is it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, have you heard of it?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Lifter, lifter... I think I saw that in the Z Program files. Wanna google it?”[%p]
Daru opens up a browser window and enters “lifter” into a search engine.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We’ve got hits!”[%p]
About 422,000 results.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That many? I guess it’s not a secret...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Could this be it? Ionocraft.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ions are charged particles. The meaning matches.”[%p]
We click on a link that says “Ionocraft (lifter)”.[%p]
It takes us to a video.[%p]
Looks like some dim garage.[%p]
But it doesn’t seem like anything secretive. Just a garage like you’d see in an average American home.[%p]
At the center of the screen is a triangular shape made of some kind of metal. It looks about 10 cm high, and about 30 cm wide.[%p]
It’s connected to some sort of generator by a thin wire.[%p]
Looks like some really cheap equipment.[%p]
That’s all there is.[%p]
Nothing else.[%p]
After explaining something in some language I don’t understand -- Russian, maybe? -- the person filming the video slowly turns the power on.[%p]
And then--[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s floating...”[%p]
The silvery triangle floats soundlessly into the air.[%p]
Then it remains stationary.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s... an anti-gravity device!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t be ridiculous. That would be the breakthrough of the century.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s called an ionocraft, so it probably has something to do with electrodes and charged air...”[%p]
Kurisu doesn’t sound as confident as she usually does.[%p]
We look up information on the ionocraft lifter.[%p]
Lots of sites have detailed instructions on how to make lifters, but I don’t know how they work since the sites all give conflicting theories.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“SERN is using this lifter technology. It’s a vital component of their time machine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If they can manipulate a micro singularity’s mass and gravitational field, then these things really are anti-gravity devices!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well, under those exact conditions, I guess you might not be entirely wrong.”[%p]
Incredible![%p]
My curiosity’s growing more by the second.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But it looks like SERN’s having trouble adjusting their lifter.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“They don’t have full control over the micro singularity’s gravity. So they can’t make a true naked singularity.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That must be the reason why the subjects turned into jellymen.”[%p]
Kurisu nods.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Since the singularity is still closed, the subject is crushed by its tremendous gravity.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“As a result, substances become fractalized. Let’s go with that hypothesis. Of course, there’s no way to be sure that it’s right. It might take months to prove.”[%p]
Kurisu shrugs her shoulders in resignation.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So SERN’s lifter is still incomplete...”[%p]
If Titor is telling the truth, then SERN won’t complete their time machine for another 24 years.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If we can complete the PhoneWave (name subject to change) first, then we’ll have outwitted SERN!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We don’t have half the equipment or funding SERN does. What makes you think you can solve a problem that they can’t?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This isn’t that simple.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“SERN still hasn’t figured out how to set the subject’s destination in time or space.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That should be evident by how scattered the jellyman discoveries were.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We don’t even know if this is all of them. There could be jellymen buried underground or floating in space. Actually, I’m almost certain there are.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There’s no point traveling through time if you end up in tens of thousands of kilometers away from the Earth. It’s not practical at all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Titor said he had a ’variable gravity lock system’. He can use that to lock onto the Earth’s gravity and ensure he arrives somewhere on the planet’s surface.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Titor’s explanation on that point was vague.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“He mentioned having such a device, but he didn’t explain how it worked.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But if you’re only moving through time, won’t you just arrive in the same location?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Of course not.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Why not?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Because the Earth is always moving.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Right. Rotation and revolution.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The Earth’s rotational velocity is about 1,650 kilometers per hour.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Its orbital velocity around the sun is about 114,000 kilometers per hour.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Meaning one hour ago, we were that far away from where we are now.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whoa! When you think about it like that, we’re earth-shatteringly fast!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And that’s not all.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The Solar System is part of the Milky Way. And the Milky Way spins like a giant whirlpool.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There are various theories, but basically the earth moves about 50 million kilometers a day.”[%p]
How can she roll all those numbers so smoothly off her tongue?[%p]
I get that she’s a genius, but it’s hardly common knowledge. Has she been doing research on the topic?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We’ve kinda gotten to a ludicrous scale.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“By the way, the Milky Way is part of a large cluster of galaxies, which is itself part of an even larger supercluster.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And these clusters and superclusters might be moving too. If that’s the case, we’re moving even more than 50 million kilometers a day.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The point is that setting the destination would require insane calculations, even if you only want to travel one second into the past.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Doing it by hand is impossible, and it might take years for a supercomputer to come up with a solution, just to get you to the same location.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then we have no choice. We need to find Titor and borrow his variable gravity system.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Great idea. Go for it.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I wonder how SERN is dealing with this problem...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...”[%p]
After blowing me off, Kurisu goes back to reading SERN’s documents.[%p]
Daru and I aren’t good with English, so there’s nothing we can do but let her work.[%p]
