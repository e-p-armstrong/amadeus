Dawn breaks.[%p]
We stayed up all night again.[%p]
Fighting drowsiness, I refill my mug with instant coffee. I’ve already lost count of how many I’ve had.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe.”[%p]
Kurisu hands her mug to me without looking away from the computer.[%p]
I guess she expects me to refill it.[%p]
Since when did I become her maid? She should ask Mayuri for stuff like this. Mayuri’s a professional maid, after all.[%p]
That said, Kurisu’s the one reading SERN’s documents right now. Daru and I can manage if we use translation software, but we’re nowhere near as efficient as she is.[%p]
While it’s not exactly what I had in mind when I said I wanted to borrow her knowledge, it just goes to show that I was right to make her a lab mem.[%p]
She’s an asset to the lab. For now, at least, I should try not to upset her.[%p]
I silently take the mug from Kurisu, dump in the powdered coffee, and pour in hot water from the pot.[%p]
Two packets of sugar. No milk.[%p]
Kurisu has already requested it the same way five times today.[%p]
I mix it well and bring it over to Kurisu. She doesn’t immediately realize I’m standing behind her, so I hold the mug in front of her face.[%p]
Kurisu takes it without turning.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thanks.”[%p]
Her eyes never leave the screen. She’s completely absorbed in SERN’s research.[%p]
Even though she was adamant when she called them traitors to scientists everywhere, she’s not above picking their brains.[%p]
But I understand how she feels. I’m itching to know more myself.[%p]
Daru is fast asleep on the sofa.[%p]
His snoring is quite loud. Furthermore, it sounds like he has sleep apnea.[%p]
I’m surprised Kurisu has been able to ignore it. Is she just that focused?[%p]
I decide to watch some TV. As always, the news channels are all covering the Radi-Kan satellite crash.[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]“Five days have passed since the satellite crash, and with the start of summer vacation season, crowds are gathering to get a glimpse of the satellite, which still has not been removed.”[%p]
[name]Teenage Girl[line]“I came from Nagoya. I wanted to see it.”[%p]
[name]Middle-aged Man[line]“I drove all the way from Saitama. It’s amazing! Where did that thing come from?”[%p]
[name]Teenage Girl 2[line]“Yay! I’m a high school girl from Chiba♪”[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]“Tourists from all over Japan are flocking to this location.”[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]“In an interview earlier today, Michael Byrne, spokesman for NASA, stated...”[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]“That no satellite had crashed in Japan, and that the crashed object was, in fact, not even a satellite.”[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]“The satellite is currently under police investigation. No date for removal has been set.”[%p]
Is it really under investigation?[%p]
This could be another plot by the Organiza--[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪ Good morning! Oh wait, should I say, good afternoon?”[%p]
The door unlocks from outside and Mayuri comes in.[%p]
She has a convenience store bag in hand.[%p]
There are various food items inside, but it doesn’t look like they’re for us.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Whoo! The air in here is sooo thick.”[%p]
The three of us probably look pretty haggard since we stayed up all night.[%p]
But it’s hard to put on a bright smile now that I know about SERN.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’ll refresh the air!”[%p]
Mayuri opens the window wide.[%p]
The sky is so blue, it hurts my eyes. Large clouds listlessly drift on the wind.[%p]
It truly is a refreshing sight.[%p]
Mayuri’s appearance makes Daru get up with a grimace.[%p]
Kurisu also finally moves away from the computer, sipping her hot coffee while rubbing her eyes.[%p]
I glance at the clock, then go to the center of the room and call for attention.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Since all lab mems are present and accounted for, this is the perfect opportunity to hold another Round Table Conference.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Roundabout confluence?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...What’s that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A meeting of lab mems.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Have we ever done that before?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Do you even have a round table?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Not physically. However, it exists in the hearts of all lab mems. Am I mistaken?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yes, you’re mistaken. Don’t go sticking things in people’s hearts.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Is there one in Mayushii too?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course there is.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, that’s good. But what’s a roundable?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And why a round table? You King Arthur?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m only a temporary lab mem anyway.”[%p]
These people whine about every little thing![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, it’s a Round Table Conference! Mayuri wasn’t here last night, so first, let’s explain the situation to her.”[%p]
I tell Mayuri about everything we discovered in her absence.[%p]
About how SERN is making a time machine.[%p]
About jellymen.[%p]
About how men in black might be coming to erase us for what we know.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I told you you shouldn’t do bad things.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph, ’bad’ you say? [color index="A0140000"]We[color index="800000"] are bad? Absurd.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If we’re bad, then SERN is even worse. They aren’t satisfied with ruling the world. Now they want to get their hands on space-time itself!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I agree.”[%p]
For some reason, Kurisu backs me up.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What SERN is doing is unforgivable. They’re traitors to humanity, to society, and to science.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I guess...”[%p]
She doesn’t sound convinced.[%p]
I didn’t want to get Mayuri involved, but she’s surprisingly perceptive. She’d find out even if we kept it a secret. So it’s better to just tell her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, Ragnarok can no longer be averted. The final battle with SERN is near.”[%p]
A large part of me is still afraid, but we’ve come too far to turn back now.[%p]
We can’t unlearn what we know.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Rag in a rock?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Norse mythology again?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina! I ordered you to investigate SERN! What have you learned?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t remember being ordered, but whatever.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There are two problems SERN faces with time travel.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“First is the electron injection device, also known as a ’lifter’.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Unless they get it to function properly, they can’t make the Kerr black hole singularites naked.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you send a test subject through the singularity in its current state, the supergravity compresses them to the micro level. Naturally, there’s no way to survive.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The second problem is that they can’t specify a physical destination. They can’t choose where they end up after traveling to the past.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s why I’d say the 14 found jellymen were the lucky ones.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Over a hundred human experiments have been performed since 2001. The remaining 80 or so people ended up somewhere they can’t be found.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Why can’t they be found?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Didn’t you know, Mayu-shi? The world is constantly moving. Its rotational speed is 1500 kph, and its orbital speed is 114,000 kph--”[%p]
Daru’s tone is authoritative, but he’s just relaying what he heard from Kurisu last night.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“SERN has been looking for solutions, but it’s not going well.”[%p]
So even SERN is having difficulties?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now then. Have you learned anything that could help us complete the PhoneWave (name subject to change)?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hmm...”[%p]
Kurisu stares at the ceiling in thought.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well, I suppose you could call the LHC the world’s largest microwave oven.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course! In other words, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is a miniature LHC!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You might be on to something there.”[%p]
I was sure she’d deny it. In fact, I thought she’d yell at me.[%p]
But instead, she agreed with me. Throws me off a little.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“However, there are too many things we don’t know about the PhoneWave. Why do the same phenomena that occur in SERN’s time machine also occur in that tiny little microwave?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Unlike the LHC, this thing wasn’t made for time travel.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It was made to warm Mayushii’s chicken!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“W-well, yeah.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Since the jellyman phenomenon occurs with the PhoneWave (name subject to change), Mayuri’s bananas must be reaching the Kerr black hole’s ring singularity.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It makes a black hole? Here?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It won’t suck us in, will it?”[%p]
If it sucked us in, we’d become jellymen too.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But we still haven’t figured out the electric discharge phenomenon, or the conditions required to cause it.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“During our experiments earlier, we were only able to send emails to the past during the discharge.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Although it hasn’t happened again, that discharge phenomenon could very well signify the injection of charge -- that is, electrons.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And only when it occurs does the path to the singularity open.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We don’t know the cause of the discharge phenomenon.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s what we need to find out.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In the first place, the emails we’re sending to the past are digital data, not physical objects. That’s a definite difference from SERN’s time machine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, we’re doing the same thing. Who’s to say that digital data can’t go through a singularity? I think it would be easier than sending something human-sized.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well... I suppose that’s true.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You know, the way you guys talk about email...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It makes me think of folding a letter into a paper airplane and making it go zoom, you know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s more like a beam of light. Like optical digital data.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By the way, it’s a pain to keep saying ’email sent to the past’. Let’s give it a proper name.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ve got a bad feeling about this.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s that supposed to mean? You dare mock Hououin Kyouma!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You just want to give it some oddball name, don’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph! How rude. Heed me! I shall name the phenomenon of ’email sent to the past’ as follows. The name shall be...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nostalgia Drive!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Confusing. Rejected.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why you! Who gave you the authority to reject my ideas!? You’re just an assistant!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then why don’t we take a vote? All in favor of Nostalgia Drive.”[%p]
My hand shoots into the air.[%p]
But nobody follows suit.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you forsaken me, Daru!? Mayuri!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Chris-chan’s right. It’s too hard for Mayushii to remember.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s way too chuuni, man.”[%p]
Traitors![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Fine! Then let’s hear alternatives! Don’t tell me you rejected my idea without having any bright ideas of your own!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I think it needs to be something easy to understand. It’s an email that regresses through time, so how about Retromail?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What does ’retro’ mean?”[%p]
Mayuri is busy eating strawberry jelly.[%p]
How can she eat that stuff after hearing about jellymen?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sounds like you have your answer, Christina. You said it should be easy to understand, but it wasn’t easy to understand at all, was it!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“B-but that’s because Mayuri-san is...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Uh, n-never mind...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Were you about to say ’because Mayuri’s dumb’?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“N-no!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Eh? Chris-chan, do you think Mayushii’s dumb?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t! I promise I don’t! Okay?”[%p]
Somehow, Kurisu manages to glare at me even while soothing Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I vote ’The Mail Who Leapt through Time’.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s too stiff. It’s hard to say.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s better than your ’Nostalagisticexpialidocious’ nonsense! And mine makes a movie title referen--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s not cool. It needs to be cool.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’re rejecting it for that?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪ Mayushii has an idea!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“How about ’Back to the Mail’? I took a movie title, and changed a word to mail!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I already did the movie joke, Mayu-shi.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Besides, I think the meaning is a little off.”[%p]
She probably meant “Mail to the Future,” but our emails go to the past.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s not about the meaning... I took a movie title and changed a word to mail...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Either way, it’s too long!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Then how about DeLorean Mail?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That doesn’t even say what kind of email it is!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey. We don’t have time for this nonsense. Let’s just abbreviate it to ’D-Mail’ and move on.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But that’s boring.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It don’t care if it’s boring.”[%p]
Shot down.[%p]
Kurisu’s influence in the lab seems to have grown significantly these past few days.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“D-Mail it is!”[%p]
Mayuri, finished with her jelly, proclaims in satisfaction.[%p]
Wait, when did Mayuri become the moderator?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So why does the D-Mail phenomenon occur?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Because the path through the ring singularity is open. We’ve been over this already.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We don’t know if there’s actually a black hole at work here. It could be an entirely different phenomenon that just happens to resemble SERN’s experiments.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s dangerous to jump to conclusions.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why so timid? Don’t you want our time travel experiments to succeed? That’s why we put our lives on the line to hack SERN!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What we need to figure out is how to turn the PhoneWave (name subject to change) into a usable time machine.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Do you really think that’s possible?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There is no think. Only do!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What, did you read that off a motivational poster? You’re like the classic incompetent boss.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn you! You dare insult the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, it’s not like Okarin’s the boss anyway.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Indeed. I am the symbol of this lab, not the boss.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t know what you mean by symbol, but how do you plan to turn the PhoneWave into a time machine? Let’s have details.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“My plan... alright, there is one thing.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’ve been thinking that the electrical discharge happens at random, but I have a hypothesis.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Which is?”[%p]
I look at my watch. It’s past noon.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Recall the conditions when it occurred, Christina. We experimented through the night with no results, but there’s one variable we overlooked. The simplest, most definitive variable of all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That is, the time of the occurrence.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...ah.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I checked the times of the two previous occurrences.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When I accidentally sent the first D-Mail to Daru’s phone, it happened between noon and one PM.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The second time, when all four of us observed the D-Mail, it was six PM.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So if we perform the experiment within that timeframe, we might be able to reproduce the effect.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Let’s try it right now!”[%p]
Kurisu bolts into the development room, suddenly bursting with enthusiasm.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, I’m glad to see she has her priorities straight.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s banana supply is getting low... gotta buy more.”[%p]
Only one banana remains untouched.[%p]
We got rid of the gelified bananas, and then we ate the rest.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sorry, Mayuri-san. I’ll go buy you some new bananas later.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really? Yay♪”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin and Daru-kun eat my bananas, but they never buy new ones...”[%p]
I’ll be sure to amend that in the future.[%p]
A bunch of bananas is a small price to pay in order to bring chaos to the world.[%p]
Kurisu picks the last banana off the stem, leans under the table, and places it inside the microwave.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“First, let’s see if it’ll become a jellyman.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Agh!”[%p]
She tries to get up and gloriously bangs her head underneath the table.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Trying for the clumsy girl appeal?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It was an accident!”[%p]
Kurisu gets up, blushing in embarrassment with tears in her eyes.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Put the microwave somewhere else! It’s dangerous and hard to reach like this.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’ll punch through the floor if we put it on the table.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Chris-chan, Chris-chan! Pain, pain, go away♪”[%p]
Mayuri pats the back of Kurisu’s head, then sweeps her hand through the air.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thanks, Mayuri-san.”[%p]
Kurisu pulls herself together, types on her phone, and activates the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
The banana inside the microwave slowly begins to spin backwards as the timer counts down.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ah!”[%p]
Kurisu, who is peering into the microwave, suddenly shouts in surprise.[%p]
The banana has vanished.[%p]
At the exact same moment, the banana reappears on its stem, gelified.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whoa!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It became a gelbana...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh... muhahaha... MUHAHAHAHA! Just as I suspected, the critical variable was time!”[%p]
I was a little anxious about the result, but it all worked out.[%p]
I outwitted the impertinent genius girl. Now my position as symbol of the lab is secure![%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“W-way to go, Okabe. It was so simple, I didn’t notice it.”[%p]
Kurisu says with a slightly sulky expression.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your praise does you credit, Christina, but I know you’re frustrated you didn’t think of it first. Muhahahaha!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, let’s see if we can send another D-Mail.”[%p]
Kurisu ignores my proud laughter and excitedly starts typing out a mail.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Guh... I feel like my authority has been on the decline since that girl showed up.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s cool, man. You never had any to begin with.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Help me, you two! Okabe, I’m sending an email to your phone.”[%p]
When did I become her assistant?[%p]
I grind my teeth in frustration, but I do as I’m told and insert my phone into the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s slot.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What are you gonna send, Chris-chan?”[%p]
Mayuri presses up against Kurisu and sneaks a peek at Kurisu’s phone.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It doesn’t matter what it says. What matters is whether we can send it or not.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hmm? Lemme see... Okabe is an airhe...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait! You there, assistant! What are you typing?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’ll see. Ready? I’m sending it.”[%p]
Daru has already set the microwave’s timer through the X68000. There’s nothing inside, but the microwave still operates. The countdown starts from 120.[%p]
This is where the timing counts.[%p]
We know that we have to open the microwave door during operation, but we still don’t know when to send the mail.[%p]
For now, we’ll do them simultaneously.[%p]
Kurisu readies her finger on her phone’s send button.[%p]
I grasp the microwave’s door handle.[%p]
Mayuri seeks cover.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Starting the countdown!”[%p]
The microwave timer soon indicates 70.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“3, 2, 1... zero.”[%p]
Kurisu presses send.[%p]
And at nearly the same instant, I open the microwave door.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Kya!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“MUHAHAHAHA! It’s working! It’s working, you guys!”[%p]
Lightning crackles in the air.[%p]
The cushion underneath the PhoneWave (name subject to change) collapses under the weight.[%p]
The floor starts creaking.[%p]
It’s exactly like the discharge phenomenon that occurred before![%p]
The discharge lasts for about ten seconds.[%p]
After it subsides, we stare at the PhoneWave (name subject to change) with bated breath.[%p]
Luckily, it didn’t break through the floor.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Did it arrive?”[%p]
I disconnect my phone from the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and check my mail.[%p]
Kurisu stands beside me and peers at the screen.[%p]
There’s an email there. Two of them, even, and they’re written in English.[%p]
The timestamps are from five days ago.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Pfft...”[%p]
Kurisu starts laughing when she sees the mail, even though she’s the one who wrote it.[%p]
The OKABE in the first one is obviously my name.[%p]
But what does AIRHEAD in the second one mean? My English is shaky. Is she saying my head can fly or something?[%p]
Whatever. I may not know what it means, but I do know this.[%p]
My assistant is making fun of me.[%p]
But that doesn’t matter right now.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina. Did you send two mails?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh? No. I only sent one.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii saw it too. She really only sent one.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I received two.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re right... I even sent it in one sentence, but it got divided.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By the way, what does this word mean?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why don’t you look it up?”[%p]
I guess she doesn’t want to answer.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That reminds me. The D-Mail from before was cut up mid-sentence too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Was it?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah. Look at your history. I’m pretty sure I sent ’Okarin’s a perv’.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re right. This one got split too.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I wonder what’s causing it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe it’s related to the jellymen.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Mayushii wants to know why it arrived five days ago.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Good point. Didn’t the last one also arrive five days before we sent it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. It did.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Is there some kind of rule for when it arrives?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Let’s try sending more!”[%p]
Mayuri’s right.[%p]
Now that we’ve figured out how to send D-Mails, we should keep experimenting and collect as much data as we can.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alright, lab mems! Battle stations!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“He’s at it again...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Our mission: to send as many D-Mails as possible!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, man the X68000. Your job is to observe, adjust, and gather information on the PhoneWave (name subject to change).”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Assistant, keep those mails coming! Try various patterns of text. Japanese, English, full-width, half-width, emoticons. The actual messages don’t matter.”[%p]
I’m sure Shining Finger would be better for the job, but since she’s not a lab mem, I’ll leave it to Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What about Mayushii?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your mission is to go shopping. Just buy some bananas for now. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall fund you!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow! You’re so generous♪”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So I guess your job is opening the microwave.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whoa! You saved the easiest job for yourself?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh. No, my assistant’s judgment is sound. The key to a successful D-Mail is most likely the correct timing of opening the microwave door!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Uh, I was just kidding.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“MUHAHAHAHA! Leave this task to Hououin Kyouma! I shall open this door with precision, boldness, and delicacy, as if it were the flesh of a beautiful woman!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin, that’s naughty!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Furthermore, the current operation is top secret. You must not leak it to anyone. Got it?”[%p]
Mayuri nods. The others are ignoring me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now I shall give this operation a name! It shall be known as Op--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t need one. Let’s start.”[%p]

You ruined my climactic scene![%p]
Damn you, assistant! This is an outrage![%p]
