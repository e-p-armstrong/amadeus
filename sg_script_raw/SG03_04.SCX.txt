We return from the convenience store to find the Braun Tube Workshop’s one and only Part-Time Warrior standing in front of the building.[%p]
She’s stretching.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Sup!”[%p]
She notices me and calls out without stopping her exercises.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What shenanigans are you up to this early in the morning?”[%p]
Shenanigans?[%p]
This girl has a thing for unusual words.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The kind you wouldn’t believe. We’re building the first time machine in human history.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh. Cool.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, shouldn’t you be more surprised!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Can’t blame her for being skeptical. I didn’t think it was possible either.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And isn’t that top secret? I thought you didn’t want anyone to know.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Crap! Part-Time Warrior, please keep what I just said a secret.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Sure. By the way...”[%p]
Part-Time Warrior glances at the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The boss is really pissed.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The noise. Whatever you’re doing up there, it’s got the whole building shaking. Dust everywhere. Kinda like an air raid.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“He was saying stuff like ’What’s that nutcase doing? I’mma raise his damn rent!’”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Maybe you should go apologize.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh boy. What if he kicks us out?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alright, leave it to me. Daru, go tell my assistant to lay off the experiments for now.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Roger that... I won’t forget you, soldier.”[%p]
Daru salutes, then races up to the second floor.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...By the way, is Makise Kurisu here too?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
Come to think of it, she did pick a fight with Christina yesterday.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you met before?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Um... no. Yesterday was first contact.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“First contact?”[%p]
That’s a strange way of putting it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh. Really?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Weren’t you a little hostile for a first contact?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“She’s... my enemy.”[%p]
What? I barely heard her, her voice was so low.[%p]
I’m about to ask her to repeat herself, but Suzuha is staring at the ground in silence. She obviously doesn’t want to talk about this.[%p]
Did she call Kurisu her enemy?[%p]
But that doesn’t make sense.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How can she be your enemy? You just met, right?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did she do something to you?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Not to me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What does that mean? She did something to someone else?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you want, I can go talk things over with Christina.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It doesn’t really matter.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe you’re blaming the wrong person?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Geez! Give it a rest!”[%p]
She hits me with a glare.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Anyway! Shouldn’t you apologize to the boss instead of talking to me?”[%p]
Heh. Actually, I’m getting cold feet.[%p]
But I am Hououin Kyouma, the mad scientist who brings chaos to the world. I can’t falter now.[%p]
I steel myself and enter the Braun Tube Workshop. Part-Time Warrior follows me inside.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I have come!”[%p]
Mister Braun is sitting at the counter inside, slurping delivery ramen.[%p]
Even when I enter, he doesn’t look away from the huge 42-inch CRT.[%p]
It’s showing some news show’s report on some celebrity divorce.[%p]
Part-Time Warrior doesn’t say anything. She’s just going to stand there and watch him rip me a new one.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Hey, Okabe. The hell are you doing up there?”[%p]
Straight to the punch.[%p]
He doesn’t take his eyes off the TV, nor does he stop slurping his ramen.[%p]
Yet despite his sedentary posture, he exudes extraordinary pressure.[%p]
But now is not the time to falter.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’re currently conducting experiments that will change the course of human history. The discoveries we make today will shape the world for centur--”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“I don’t care what games you guys play. I’m the owner of this building. Got it?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“And the building’s really worn out. You keep shaking it like that, you could bring the whole damn thing down on our heads.”[%p]
Better keep quiet about the dent in the floor.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh... Veeery interesting, Mister Braun. Don’t tell me you forged this building’s earthquake safety certificate?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“What if I did?”[%p]
Holy crap.[%p]
M-maybe we should seek shelter soon...[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“It’s been properly reinforced. But regardless, you guys are still shaking it too much.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph! So what if a few buildings collapse?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“What’s that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“As I’ve said countless times before, our current experiment is of vital importance to the history of science -- no, to the history of human civilization itself!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s more important than prolonging this building’s lifetime for another ten or so measly years!”[%p]
The building starts shaking again as soon as I finish speaking.[%p]
Flakes of concrete start falling from the ceiling. The 42-inch CRT’s image goes to static.[%p]
Dammit, Daru! What are you doing!? I thought I told you to stop the experiments![%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Okabe!”[%p]
He’s glaring at me.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“The ceiling is falling, you dumbass! Some got into my ramen! What are you gonna do about it, huh!? No more shaking!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Or I’ll raise your rent by 10,000!”[%p]
What!? If you raise it 10,000 yen, we’re ruined![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Leave it to me, Mister Braun! On my honor, I swear there won’t be any more shaking today!”[%p]
With that, I race out of the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
