[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina! Stop the experiments at once!”[%p]
When I burst into the lab, I find the three of them in the middle of lunch.[%p]
Mayuri has Juicy Chicken Number One.[%p]
Daru has a convenience store boxed lunch.[%p]
Kurisu’s eating cup noodles with a fork.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Sorry, Okarin. Mayushii tried to warm up some chicken.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I accidentally put it through reverse rotation, and then it started sparking.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I see.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I sent you an email. Didn’t you get it?”[%p]
Your sarcasm is not appreciated, Christina.[%p]
You know as well as I do that my phone is still attached to the PhoneWave (name subject to change)![%p]
I disconnect my phone from the PhoneWave (name subject to change) while grinding my teeth.[%p]
One more please?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stop screwing around! I’m the one who has to deal with Mister Braun!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But I gave you five days advance notice.”[%p]
Well, yeah, the timestamp’s from five days ago, but...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Was he mad?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah... I could feel his Killing Aura.”[%p]
Daru turns pale, but the two girls don’t seem to care.[%p]
They know not the wrath of Mister Braun. Ignorance is bliss.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, no more experiments today.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well, at least we got some good data.”[%p]
Then Kurisu hides her mouth with her hand as she yawns.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m dead tired, and my hair’s dried out. I want to take a shower and go sleep.”[%p]
I sigh and take a boxed lunch out of the convenience store bag.[%p]
It’s cold, so I toss it into the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and set the timer [color index="A0140000"]normally[color index="800000"].[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“If you want a shower, there’s one here. It doesn’t have a bath, though. Okarin always uses it.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s probably filthy...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’d be lying if I called it clean. This entire building is in shambles.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, I refuse to use the same shower as Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I understand. Nobody will blame you if you don’t use it. Of course, since the three of us stayed up all night, we’re all pretty smelly. Heh heh heh.”[%p]
Given the sweltering heat and the fact that we kept the windows closed all night, I bet this place is smelling pretty rank by now.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s why I’m going back to my hotel once I finish eating.”[%p]
Kurisu slurps her cup noodles indignantly. I bought them at her request. She was raised in America, yet she likes cup noodles? Strange.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Celebrity bath time at a high class hotel? I want to come too.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Not a chance.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii wants to come too!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You can come any time, Mayuri-san.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really? Thank you♪”[%p]
I take my warm food out of the microwave, take a fresh bottle of Dr P out of the fridge, and join in on lunch.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, Okarin, I’ve been wondering, but why do you drink soda while you eat? Does it make it taste better?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t really see a problem.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Me neither.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Same. I didn’t give it a second thought.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re acting weird, Mayuri. It’s normal to drink soda while eating.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s normal, duh.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No objections.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“No way! You guys are the weird ones!”[%p]
Well, I’m a pure [color index="820000"]Docperian[color index="800000"], Daru loves cola like a typical fat otaku, and Kurisu lives in America, home of soda.[%p]
So I admit our opinion is biased.[%p]
But that doesn’t matter right now.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now, let’s discuss Operation Urd’s progress.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Operation Urd?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, right. Thanks to a certain assistant, I didn’t get a chance to present the operation’s codename yesterday. Heed me! These D-Mail experiments are all part of Operation Ur--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The experiments have been fruitful.”[%p]
She interrupts me again.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“At the very least, we’ve learned what we can do with D-Mail.”[%p]
Kurisu places her empty noodle cup on the table, then retrieves the whiteboard from the development room.[%p]
While the rest of us eat, she scribbles on the whiteboard, then puts it up against the wall.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That about sums it up. Anything to add?”[%p]
Nothing especially. She’s summarized the vital parts.[%p]
Mayuri has her mouth half-open in a blank stare. She clearly doesn’t understand.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A D-Mail can be at most 36 English characters or 18 Japanese characters long. That makes experimentation difficult, so we’ll want to improve that first.”[%p]
Furthermore, each D-Mail is split into 12 character segments. If you send 36 characters, you’ll get three 12-character emails. If you try to send more, everything after the 36th character disappears.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But we figured out how to control when it arrives. That’s pretty good, right?”[%p]
Though we can only set it in one hour increments, we can control how far back D-Mails go by using the microwave’s timer.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Observation isn’t enough. We need to find the underlying principle. What I’ve written here is nothing but verified phenomena.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The underlying principle... you’re right. It’s not a complete time machine until we understand how it works.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What could be the reason for the character limit?”[%p]
Daru and Kurisu remain silent.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um...”[%p]
Suddenly, Mayuri, who has been staring at the ceiling in confusion until now, raises her hand.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Chicken and bananas become ’gelchicken’ and ’gelbanas’, but salt doesn’t turn into ’gelsalt’, right?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So much gel...”[%p]
According to Mayuri, the refrozen chicken had indeed been gelified when she tried eating it. Kurisu’s prediction was right.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And you can send 36 letters in a D-Mail, but everything past that disappears, right-?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So I think maybe you can’t send big things, or a lot of small things.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Maybe the Curb black hole--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Uh, it’s Kerr black hole.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The Curb black hole--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Kerr black hole.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...the black hole’s hole is too tight.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Mayu-shi... say that one more time. Starting from ’hole’.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The hole is too tight!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Outrageous!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stop making her say stuff like that!”[%p]
Mayuri has flowers for brains, so she’s easy prey for Daru’s perversions. It drives me crazy.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The hole is tight... huh. That might not be entirely wrong.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Maybe we have the same problem SERN has with their time machine. Since they can’t fully control the lifter, they can’t make the singularities perfectly naked, which limits how much they can send.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Anyway, 6 Japanese or 12 English characters comes out to 12 bytes.”[%p]
English characters are half-width, so they only use one byte, but full-width Japanese characters use two.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Bytes? Not kilobytes?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh? So Makise-shi’s bad with computers?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh. Is that so, assistant?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sh-shut up! You don’t see things measured in bytes nowadays, so I was just making sure...”[%p]
By the way, 1 kilobyte is 1024 bytes. 1 byte is 8 bits.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, email isn’t just comprised of text. There’s more to it, like the sender and receiver’s email addresses, the header, and various other things.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So roughly speaking, we can send data in three batches of 12 bytes, then? By the way, I don’t know if using a subject changes anything.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I’m pretty sure that chicken and bananas have to be larger than 12 bytes.”[%p]
How do you measure a banana in bytes anyway?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Since each grain of salt is tiny, it’s possible they could be converted to less than 12 bytes.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So larger masses get crushed by supergravity?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mass might not be the issue here. Data doesn’t have mass.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In any case, since the singularity isn’t naked, the object is forced to pass through the event horizon.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Inside the event horizon, space and time switch places, causing the subject that arrived at the ring singularity to reach ultra high speed...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The data, crushed and destroyed by super gravity, is shot out of the black hole...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“As a jellyman.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But even a small mass has to pass through supergravity. How does it emerge unscathed?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If the hole is too tight, then just inject more electrons.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t think it’s that simple. I mean, I’m sure SERN’s tried that already. And yet they haven’t gotten any results after nine years of experiments.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s not as simple as increasing the flow of electrons.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“SERN has a lifter, but we don’t know what in the PhoneWave is filling the same role, much less how to adjust it.”[%p]
She has a point.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We don’t know what acts as the lifter...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But we do know that it has successfully created a path wide enough to send approximately 36 bytes of data through the ring singularity.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I don’t get it...”[%p]
Mayuri, finished with her chicken, looks at us in confusion.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Think of it like an RPG. The ring singularity, the entrance to the event horizon, is the gate to the Demon Lord’s castle.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“D-demon Lord...?”[%p]
[margin top="228"]Hundreds of soldiers attack the heavily fortified Demon Lord’s castle gate.[%e]
[margin top="152"]The soldiers can use the magic called Lifter to force the castle gate open. But they can only keep it open for a moment before it closes. During that moment, only 12 soldiers can break through.[%e]
[margin top="190"]The soldiers can only use Lifter magic three times.[linebreak]The 36 soldiers who make it through the gate return triumphantly as the heroes who slew the Demon Lord.[%e]
[margin top="152"]But the soldiers who were left behind are imprisoned by the Demon Lord’s minions. They’re taken to the castle’s prison cells and turned into slimes.[linebreak]The heroes save them after defeating the Demon Lord, but unfortunately, they go home as slimes.[%e]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So the soldiers who went home as slimes are jellymen?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But there’s an exception.”[%p]
[margin top="228"]The soldiers can combine into a Super Soldier with the strength and size of a hundred ordinary soldiers.[%e]
[margin top="228"]The Super Soldier has the power to defeat the Demon Lord alone, but since his body is too big, he can’t pass through the gate, even when it’s opened by Lifter.[%e]
[margin top="190"]And so, deprived of his magic’s effectiveness, the weakened Super Soldier is seized by the Demon Lord’s underlings and sent home in defeat as a giant slime.[%e]
[name]Itaru[line]“Combining soldiers? That’s just silly.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s to illustrate that the object can’t be too big.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I get it! That’s really easy to understand.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It is?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s a dumb metaphor, but I guess it works? At least as an explanation for why things get gelified.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh. It’s all thanks to Mayuri’s hint.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii was helpful?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. Great insight, Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe! Yay!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But it’s still a hypothesis. It hasn’t been proven.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“How would you prove it? With human experiments like SERN?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If Okabe and Hashida-san volunteer as test subjects, I’ll happily experiment on you.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Human experimentation sounds kinda dirty. If you know what I mean.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But I refuse. I’d rather play the doctor than the subject.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Same here. No, not in the way he’s implying.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Idiots.”[%p]
Kurisu gives us a cold stare and shrugs her shoulders in exasperation.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“As I keep saying, the real problem is what the PhoneWave uses as a lifter.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That and one other thing. How come the discharge phenomenon and gelification only happen during a certain timeframe?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We may not understand everything, but we’ve perfected the art of D-Mailing. Isn’t that our [color index="820000"]Final Answer[color index="800000"]?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Sending mail to the past is amazing, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Though I guess it’s not a real time machine unless we can send people to the past.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Even SERN has failed to send humans through. If you believe what Titor says, it won’t be another, what, 24 years before there’s a true time machine?”[%p]
I answer Kurisu’s sarcastic question with a nod.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Physical time travel is impossible for us at the moment. We lack the funds and facilities available to SERN.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And yet we have realized a form of time travel. We’ve sent data to the past.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We should investigate the PhoneWave further. We need to understand what’s going on.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I have some fun ideas for how to use D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know how you feel, but we can’t today. If we shake the building again, Mister Braun is sure to blow a gasket.”[%p]
He’ll raise the rent or kick us out of the lab.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We can start experimenting again tomorrow. But this, I will declare now.”[%p]
I step onto the couch and look at each lab mem in turn.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You have to take off your shoes. It’s dirty!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Today -- uhh, what day is it?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“August 2nd.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“August 2nd, 2010 is a date which will live in infamy!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“For on this day, we, the Future Gadget Laboratory, have developed--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The first successful time machine in the history of mankind!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s not the first. SERN beat us.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And you can’t even say we developed it. It happened by accident.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph! It seems that my assistant doesn’t know the meaning of the word ’serendipity’. [color index="820000"]Penicillin[color index="800000"], [color index="820000"]X-ray[color index="800000"] machines, [color index="820000"]dynamite[color index="800000"] -- these inventions and more were all born from coincidence!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I guess...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But Chris-chan, you said before that time machines don’t exist, right? But now you admit they do!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s just that I [color index="A0140000"]have[color index="800000"] to admit it for now. If we investigate how the PhoneWave works, it might turn out to be something that only [color index="A0140000"]seems[color index="800000"] like time travel.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Does nobody have any respect for my grand declaration!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t complain if I take all the credit for inventing the first -- second, whatever -- time machine in human history!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The 66th Round Table Conference ends here. Dismissed!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, that was a Round Table Conference? I didn’t know that. And it’s even the 66th.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Who cares what kind of table it is?”[%p]
Kurisu gets up from her chair and stretches.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m gonna go back to my hotel, take a shower, and sleep.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii has to go to work soon.”[%p]
I’m incredibly tired too.[%p]
Let’s just sleep today.[%p]
But when I lie down, I find myself unable to sleep. Though part of me is still frightened by the dark secrets we’ve uncovered, the curiosity and excitement are too much to bear.[%p]
We’ve built a machine that can send emails to the past.[%p]
It’s like a dream, but it’s real, and it’s ours.[%p]
As I start thinking of ways to use it, my imagination spreads out to infinity, driving the last vestiges of fear from my mind.[%p]
