I’m standing in absolute darkness.[%p]
How long have I been here? I can’t remember.[%p]
I can’t move.[%p]
I can’t feel.[%p]
I can’t see.[%p]
The world is empty.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]No. Not empty.[%e]
A voice resounds in the blackness.[%p]
As if whispering in my ear.[%p]
As if screaming from far away.[%p]
As if dozens of people around me are speaking at once.[%p]
Where am I?[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]You...[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]Are beyond the event horizon.[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]Where time and space switch places.[%e]
Suddenly, the darkness is dispelled.[%p]
An ocean of stars fills the heavens.[%p]
The sight is breathtakingly beautiful.[%p]
However, one point in space lacks stars.[%p]
I notice that point.[%p]
I stare at that point.[%p]
My body starts to fall.[%p]
I’m falling through the sea of stars.[%p]
No, not falling.[%p]
I’m being pulled. Pulled into a rift of utter darkness from which not even light can escape.[%p]
In an instant, my consciousness has exceeded the speed of light.[%p]
Stars flash past and vanish from sight.[%p]
Light itself is but dust in my wake.[%p]
Logic screams that this cannot be.[%p]
Nothing can move faster than light.[%p]
That would contradict the theory of relativity.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]You aren’t moving.[%e]
That voice again.[%p]
It comes from behind, overtaking my faster-than-light consciousness. At the same time, it seems to lie in wait at my destination.[%p]
Why do I hear Christina’s voice?[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]You aren’t moving.[%e]
Those same words.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]Remember what I said. Here, space and time switch places.[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]You can’t move through space.[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]But your time is stretching out to eternity.[%e]
I accelerate.[%p]
I can hardly breathe.[%p]
It feels like something is crushing my body.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]One second for you. An eternity for me.[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]As I observe you from a distance,[linebreak][center]I see you as a still object.[%e]
I fall.[%p]
I’m pulled.[%p]
To the depths of the dark.[%p]
Or perhaps to the end of the universe.[%p]
But even beyond the speed of light, I’ll never reach it.[%p]
Am I looping?[%p]
No, that’s not it.[%p]
Is the “end” running away from me?[%p]
That’s not it either.[%p]
Stretching.[%p]
What is stretching?[%p]
Space?[%p]
Me?[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]Don’t look back.[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]Eternity is not infinite.[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]Time stretches towards eternity.[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]Yet it has an end.[%e]
Something approaches.[%p]
It approaches slowly, a stark contrast to the stars flashing past.[%p]
Is it really approaching?[%p]
It looks like it’s standing still.[%p]
Its slowness gives it that illusion.[%p]
I don’t know what it is.[%p]
But it is [color index="A0140000"]something[color index="800000"].[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]The event horizon.[%e]
I try to reach towards it.[%p]
But my hand won’t move.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]Don’t look back.[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]You will see only yourself, trapped in a second stretched out to eternity.[%e]
I’m slowing to a stop.[%p]
But still I keep falling.[%p]
The end never comes.[%p]
An asymptotic approach to zero.[%p]
When will this second pass?[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]Time and space have switched places.[%e]
A second stretched out to infinity.[%p]
1 second becomes 0.1 seconds.[%p]
0.1 seconds become 0.01 seconds.[%p]
0.01 seconds become 0.001 seconds.[%p]
0.0001 seconds.[%p]
0.00001 seconds.[%p]
0.000001 seconds.[%p]
0.0000001 seconds.[%p]
0.00000001 seconds.[%p]
0.000000001 seconds.[%p]
When will I arrive?[%p]
Gradually, time shortens.[%p]
Gradually, my perception of time lengthens.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]Face forward. Struggle on.[%e]
No matter how close I get, I can never reach.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]To the Demon Lord’s gate.[%e]
Suddenly, her words take on an amused tone.[%p]
The Demon Lord’s Gate.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]You don’t have the key.[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]You can’t pry it open.[%e]
I try to shout.[%p]
But my mouth won’t move.[%p]
I mustn’t look back.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]You will be captured by the Demon Lord’s minions.[%e]
Pictures from the Jellyman’s Report flicker through my brain.[%p]
My body--[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]Don’t look back.[%e]
I want to look back.[%p]
I want to go back.[%p]
I can’t look back.[%p]
I can’t go back.[%p]
I face towards the [color index="A0140000"]thing[color index="800000"].[%p]
I face the future of becoming a jellyman.[%p]
While frozen for eternity...[%p]
