[name]Rintaro[line]“Nn... ugh...?”[%p]
Roused by a melody, I slowly open my eyes.[%p]
Instead of an ocean of stars, I see the lab’s familiar ceiling.[%p]
Ugh, what a bad dream.[%p]
It’s bright out. What time is it?[%p]
My phone is ringing.[%p]
It says I have mail.[%p]
This must be what woke me up.[%p]
That mail demon again?[%p]
I thought I told her to stop with the spam.[%p]
I stare blankly at my phone’s flickering display.[%p]
My mind and body feel like lead.[%p]
I don’t want to move.[%p]
I don’t want to think.[%p]
My phone rings again, signaling another email.[%p]
But instead of checking it, I lie back down on the sofa and--[%p]
There is a reserved knock on the door.[%p]
Next comes a muffled voice.[%p]
I couldn’t quite catch what was said, but it sounded like a woman’s voice.[%p]
Don’t tell me. Is it the person who’s been sending these mails?[%p]
There’s only one person who’d send me mails with such frequency.[%p]
I get up from the sofa, annoyed.[%p]
I check the clock. It’s 9 AM. I slept for over 15 hours.[%p]
No wonder I feel so lethargic.[%p]
I stifle a yawn as I unlock the door.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Ah...”[%p]
When I open the door, I see Shining Finger -- Kiryu Moeka -- standing there, looking down at her phone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I was asleep.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Her expression doesn’t change, but she bows her head slightly.[%p]
I guess that’s her way of saying sorry.[%p]
I guess I can’t just leave her standing there. I reluctantly invite her in, then shut the door and collapse back onto the sofa.[%p]
I’m still half asleep.[%p]
I went to the trouble of inviting her in, but Moeka just stands in the corner of the room.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...You’re covered in sweat.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh. I just had a little taste of what it’s like to be a particle drifting through space.”[%p]
That was one hell of a nightmare.[%p]
Maybe I’m more shocked by the truth of SERN’s experiments than I thought I was.[%p]
At any rate, I’m still drowsy.[%p]
My vision’s a little blurry too.[%p]
I feel like yawning again. I fail to stifle it this time.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So you came to see the IBN 5100?”[%p]
Moeka nods.[%p]
Then she starts entering something on her phone.[%p]
We’re face to face. Why is she sending me mail?[%p]
I’ve never seen anyone act like this before.[%p]
Or maybe this is the curse of the esper power known as Shining Finger![%p]
Use it too much, and you lose the ability to talk normally.[%p]
True, I did say that.[%p]
But if you’re going to visit someone, don’t you usually let them know beforehand?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can show you... but did you have to come so early?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait... I get it! Your true intention is to do an article on me, isn’t it!?”[%p]
Like back when we first met, and she took a picture of my face without permission.[%p]
Since I am the infamous mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, I am quite the delicious topic.[%p]
In my dealings with dark powers, I’ve learned secrets that could topple governments. People would love to get their hands on my knowledge.[%p]
Of course, that’s why I’m being chased by the Organization.[%p]
And that’s why I refuse all interviews and photo ops.[%p]
And now comes this woman, aiming to get me while I’m still half asleep![%p]
A dirty trick, but effective![%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
But Moeka doesn’t react to my sharp accusation.[%p]
Am I wrong about her?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not reading it.”[%p]
Moeka’s shoulders twitch.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’d feel like an idiot exchanging emails when you’re standing right in front of me.”[%p]
Besides, I don’t have the energy to read each and every mail right now.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Speak.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
But instead of speaking, she just stares at her phone.[%p]
I see her cheeks faintly stiffen.[%p]
She’s probably daunted by my aura of madness.[%p]
Understandable. I am the Harbinger of Chaos, after all! Muhahaha![%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Is it okay?”[%p]
Oh, now she’s talking. Too bad I don’t understand what she means.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is what okay?”[%p]
I don’t miss the way Moeka quickly scans the room.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Please show me... the IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Fine. But just look. After you look, you leave. Okay?”[%p]
I won’t sell or lend it to her, no matter what.[%p]
That machine is critical to our hacking operation against SERN, the enemy.[%p]
Moeka bites her lip.[%p]
But she soon nods faintly.[%p]
I open the curtains to the development room.[%p]
Off to the side is the cardboard box with the IBN 5100 inside.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s in that cardboard box over there.”[%p]
I point to it by jerking my chin.[%p]
Moeka slowly walks up to the cardboard box, takes a breath, and peeks inside.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Ah!”[%p]
Her eyes instantly light up, and she stares at the machine in fascination.[%p]
Maybe she’s not only a mail demon, but also a retro PC maniac?[%p]
Or maybe she’s even a pervert with a retro PC fetish?[%p]
No way. I don’t want to live in the same world as perverts of that level.[%p]
After staring at the IBN 5100 for a few moments, Moeka starts cheerfully typing out a mail.[%p]
What an annoying woman.[%p]
It’s probably not worth the effort to read the email.[%p]
Screw it.[%p]
It would be over in a second if she just talked.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No unauthorized photographs. First, show me the camera you’re going to use.”[%p]
Unless I place strict restrictions on photography, she might snap my picture when I’m not paying attention.[%p]
I’m being chased by the Organization, so I can’t expose my face to the media.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka stops moving once I give her my instructions.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just place the camera you’re going to use on that shelf so I can see it. Okay? No funny business.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka silently places her phone on the shelf.[%p]
But she doesn’t let go. She keeps her hand on it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...That’s it? You’re going to use your phone camera?”[%p]
Moeka nods, still expressionless.[%p]
I thought she was doing a magazine article, but if she’s using her phone...[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Silence.[%p]
Moeka fidgets nervously and stares at my feet.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Mail.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Speak.”[%p]
Instead of speaking, Moeka turns and points her phone at the box.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“H-hey! What are you doing!?”[%p]
She took a picture![%p]
I stab my index fingers at Moeka.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t move! Do as I say. Place your phone slowly on the shelf inside. Do it now! Any sudden movements and you’re dead!”[%p]
Fortunately, Moeka complies.[%p]
She places her phone on the shelf.[%p]
But she doesn’t let go. She keeps her hand on it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why did you take a picture?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...I wanted to.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You could’ve asked for permission. Why didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I asked... by mail.”[%p]
So that was what the last mail was about?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh... You really need to learn to talk.”[%p]
But why did she take a picture?[%p]
Oh, right. She works at a magazine. Are the pictures for an article?[%p]
Who uses a phone to take pictures for publication?[%p]
Something tells me she’s not very good at her job.[%p]
Or maybe she’s so nervous about interviewing me that she forgot her camera?[%p]
At any rate, I’m starting to feel sorry for her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alright. You can take as many pictures as you want, but on one condition. No face shots. If you take a picture of me, I’ll have no choice but to silence you.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I don’t want your picture.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Oh.”[%p]
Moeka starts shooting the IBN 5100.[%p]
She doesn’t even glance at the great Hououin Kyouma.[%p]
Heh. She may act like she doesn’t care, but I can tell she’s waiting for me to lower my guard. She can’t deceive these eyes of mine![%p]
A picture of me is worth millions to the right people.[%p]
Given her stalker-like behavior, it seems safe to assume that I am the true focus of her interest.[%p]
But I won’t be exposed so easily.[%p]
I feel sorry for her, but I can’t let the Organization find me.[%p]
I’ve been on the run for so long that caution has become habit.[%p]
Leave no trace of where you’ve been.[%p]
Stay vigilant around the clock.[%p]
That’s how you stay alive.[%p]
I keep my guard up, ready to respond with lethal force should she attempt to take my picture.[%p]
But five minutes later, and she’s still focused on the IBN 5100. It’s like I’m not even in the room.[%p]
Tch, she dares attack my pride? A fearsome opponent indeed.[%p]
