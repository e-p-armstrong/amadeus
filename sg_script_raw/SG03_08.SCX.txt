Thirty minutes later, Moeka is still taking pictures.[%p]
The period between shutter sounds has lengthened, but she’s still adjusting her angle for every shot. Her expression is completely serious.[%p]
Come on. It’s a computer, not a supermodel.[%p]
I watch her work from the lounge as I munch on a breakfast banana.[%p]
I would have preferred to get something from the convenience store, but I didn’t want to leave Moeka alone.[%p]
I know the IBN 5100 is too heavy for her to carry, but still. There’s no telling what this fanatic will do if I let her out of my sight.[%p]
Suddenly, I get another mail.[%p]
What is it this time?[%p]
It’s so absurd that I have to go along with her tedious “mail talk.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I already said no.”[%p]
I direct my answer towards the development room.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Besides, that thing weighs a ton. You can’t carry it by yourself.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait a minute!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why are you assuming I’ll lend it to you!? I already said I wouldn’t!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Really?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Really.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...No matter what?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No matter what.”[%p]
Once again, she does her thing, typing on her phone at high speed.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Did she really have to send me a one word mail?[%p]
What a troublesome woman.[%p]
It’s probably just another worthless mail from Moeka.[%p]
If she wants to assert herself, then she should speak up.[%p]
After staring at me for several seconds, she grabs the cardboard box and starts to lift.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Ugh!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey! Hold it right there!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing!?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Taking it home.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Like hell you are! Who said you could!?”[%p]
Fortunately, she’s much too weak to lift the behemoth of a computer.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You... didn’t reply to my mail.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
I quickly check the most recent mail.[%p]
So if I don’t reply, that means it’s okay. I see the logic behind--[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No! That argument’s just irrational!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka’s still clinging to the cardboard box.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Step away from the machine.”[%p]
She listens to me and reluctantly stands up.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now listen well.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The phantom retro PC, the IBN 5100, has chosen me, Hououin Kyouma, as its contractual master.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s the undeniable truth. Not even God can change this decision. For it is the choice of Steins Gate!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Besides, I’m only borrowing the IBN 5100’s power. When I’m done with it, I’m returning it to its original owner.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Stop with the mails already![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t tell you. I swore a blood oath to maintain secrecy and protect the original owner from those who desire the IBN 5100.”[%p]
I mean, anything could happen.[%p]
Moeka might seduce Luka’s dad, for instance, and get him to lend her the IBN 5100.[%p]
And then I couldn’t complain if Moeka took it away.[%p]
I must avoid that situation at all costs.[%p]
Of course, I don’t think Moeka can seduce anyone with her personality. And since Luka’s dad has a wife and kids, I don’t think he’d fall easily either.[%p]
I’m probably just thinking too much.[%p]
Moeka, meanwhile, is staring at the floor in what I assume is defeat.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I am not without sympathy for your plight.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I formed a contract with the IBN 5100 for my own goals. After I achieve those goals, you can negotiate with the original owner to form a contract of your own.”[%p]
When I return the IBN 5100 to Yanabayashi Shrine, Ragnarok will be over, and the fate of the world will have already been decided.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And when Ragnarok is over, whether it ends in victory or defeat, my life as Hououin Kyouma will be...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, forget what I said. This is no time to be thinking about the future. After all, my future is already...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Anyway... where was it?”[%p]
Geez, I had some good angst going there. She’s just oblivious to the mood.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine.”[%p]
Just then, I hear the sound of the door opening. Moeka twitches.[%p]
I look into the lounge and see Daru, wiping the sweat off his brow with a towel as he comes in.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...Guten Morgen.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You sure are early.”[%p]
Ever since university went into summer break, Daru has been coming to the lab in the morning less and less.[%p]
But then again, he’s also been staying up all night more and more.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I went to bed early. Woke up at five this morning.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Man, it’s hot! It’s not supposed to be this hot in the morning.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh? Oh? Okarin, who’s this erot... sexy 3D woman?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah, let me introduce you. This is Shining Finger, Kiryu Moeka.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Shining... Finger? Does her hand glow with an awesome power?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, but she’s definitely an esper.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“An esper? That’s stupid.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Watch her type. You’ll see.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, whatever. Welcome to the lab, Kiryu-shi.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Even though Daru bowed his head, Moeka doesn’t so much as look at him.[%p]
She’s now looking down at her phone -- not that she ever really looked away.[%p]
Daru turns red.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wh-what magnificent ignore skill. Are you looking down on me because I’m a fatass ota? You’re a [color index="820000"]mainstream woman[color index="800000"], aren’t you!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Um, Moeka, this is my Favorite Right Arm, Super Hacka Daru--”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka lowers her chin imperceptibly. Was that supposed to be a bow?[%p]
Her expression hasn’t changed at all. Everything Daru says flows cleanly through one ear and out the other.[%p]
And she was so eager to meet the super hacka before.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hey, Okarin. Did you... [color index="A0140000"]do[color index="800000"] something to her?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Like what? We were just taking pictures.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Pictures... [color index="A0140000"]pictures[color index="800000"]? So you’re going to blackmail her and force her to be our sex toy...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stop applying eroge logic to reality.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“My bad.”[%p]
Daru’s jokes aren’t helping.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, right. I thought up some upgrades we could make to the PhoneWave.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Like what?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You know how it’s a huge pain in the ass to send D-Mails to the past?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I want to simplify that process. Oh, and also make it possible to forward from the PhoneWave’s dedicated phone.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Forward? What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Right now, you can only send a D-Mail to the phone attached to the PhoneWave, right?”[%p]
That’s right. In yesterday’s experiments, my phone was attached to the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s socket, so my inbox got flooded with D-Mails.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s pretty inconvenient. If we give the PhoneWave’s dedicated phone a forwarding function, we can use it to send D-Mails to any number we want.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How long will that upgrade take?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Two or three hours? That’s if you help me, though.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Understood. I’ll help.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“OK.”[%p]
Daru really is reliable.[%p]
I walk up to him with my hand raised for a high five.[%p]
But he completely ignores it, sits on the sofa, and begins eating.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Dammit! Pay attention, Daru![%p]
I slowly lower my hand.[%p]
W-whatever.[%p]
Once the upgrades are complete, we’ll gather the lab mems and begin discussing serious D-Mail use.[%p]
It’s time to think about the practical applications of sending mail to the past.[%p]
Another mail?[%p]
I could ignore it, but the ringtone keeps demanding my attention. This is far more irritating than normal conversation.[%p]
But maybe that’s the point. Normally, Moeka just kind of fades into the background. This could be her way of forcing people to pay attention to her.[%p]
Daru, you idiot![%p]
How could you make such a basic mistake!?[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka, whose eyes have never once left her phone, is now staring straight at me.[%p]
I ignore the ringtone and go back to the development room.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you want to say something, then say it to my--”[%p]
I lose my breath mid-sentence.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka is staring straight at me.[%p]
Moeka, whose eyes never leave her phone.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Read the email.”[%p]
Her serious tone gives me pause.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Say it to my--”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Sending email to the past.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“That’s what he said.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Tell me.”[%p]
Daru, you idiot![%p]
How could you make such a basic mistake!?[%p]
I need to talk my way out of this somehow![%p]
She may just be a part-timer, but she’s still a journalist of sorts.[%p]
If she learns that we’ve built the world’s first time machine, there’s no way we’ll be able to keep it under wraps.[%p]
The Organization is sure to find out.[%p]
I can’t let that happen.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You misheard us.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“No.”[%p]
Moeka shakes her head.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I know what I heard.”[%p]
Moeka’s pretty persistent.[%p]
I know that because of her mail attacks.[%p]
She won’t let me escape so easily.[%p]
What should I do!?[%p]
In frustration, I put my phone to my ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. There’s a problem. ...No, not that. Information on Number 8 got leaked to a third party. ...Yeah, I know. I need to do something.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Depending on the situation, I may have to silence her. ...Yeah, I know. We can’t let the Organization know about this.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Steins Gate seems to enjoy sending trouble my way. ...Heh, don’t worry. My seat in hell can wait until Ragnarok is over.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
I put my phone in my pocket and turn back to Moeka.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Who was that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It doesn’t concern you.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka looks down and begins typing another mail.[%p]
What the hell does that mean?[%p]
Since she didn’t include her usual signature, does that mean she was in a hurry? Her expression didn’t change at all, though.[%p]
Anyway, I disregard the mail’s contents and take one step towards Moeka.[%p]
She makes no attempt to escape. I’m standing between her and the door.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kiryu Moeka. You must swear to protect our secret... or die.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Choose now. No time to think it over. No alternatives either.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You have learned our secret, and now you must pay the price.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...You’ll kill me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Only if you try to go public. Underestimate the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, at your per--”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Are you at it again, Okarin?”[%p]
Daru’s standing behind me.[%p]
I turn around in surprise.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Kiryu-shi, was it? Okarin’s kind of crazy, so it’s ok to ignore him when he talks like this.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Can’t you see what’s going on, Super Hacka!?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Imbecile! Because of your careless tongue, she found out that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is a time machine!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“A... time machine!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uh, that was pretty careless too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Guh...”[%p]
This is awful. Everything that could go wrong, has.[%p]
How do I recover!?[%p]
First, I need to silence Moe--[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪ Good morning!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin! Mayushii wants to warm up some chicken before you start the time travel experiments.”[%p]
I drop to my knees in utter despair.[%p]
We’re finished. It’s impossible to talk our way out of this one.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kiryu Moeka. I’ll tell you everything... and I have a favor to ask.”[%p]
