[name]Rintaro[line]“Tremble, right arm of mine! By the covenant I command thee. Come forth, hellfire of darkest black! Fulfill my desire for ultimate destruction. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hrraahm!!”[%p]
I pull hard with both my arms, tearing the microwave door free with a terrible screech.[%p]
The screws were loosened, but it sounds like I might have broken something too. Well, whatever.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ahhh! Now I can’t warm up any more chicken...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This isn’t a microwave anymore. It’s a time machine.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s not fair! Go buy a new microwave, Okarin!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t have that kind of money!”[%p]
Besides, this was Daru’s idea.[%p]
Removing the microwave door means we don’t have to open it every time we want to send a D-Mail.[%p]
Daru is currently reprogramming the microwave so that it won’t stop when the door’s open.[%p]
He’s already programmed the forwarding feature.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka takes a picture with her phone.[%p]
I cover the lens with my hand.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I told you no pictures.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...In commemoration.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of what? Anyway, no pictures.”[%p]
Moeka complies.[%p]
I registered her as Lab Mem Number 005 just a bit earlier.[%p]
It was a choice between letting her leak word of the time machine or forcing her to join our group. I reluctantly choose the latter.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kuh... I’ve gone soft. The old me would have killed her without a second thought.”[%p]
Moeka is standing right next to me, but my monologue has no effect.[%p]
Looks like she wants to ask me something.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What is it?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Is it really a time machine?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes. You’ll see. But you can’t tell anyone. Okay?”[%p]
Moeka nods.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Alright, program complete.”[%p]
Kurisu, lying on the sofa, looks up from the technical manual she was reading. She got here about thirty minutes ago.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then lets resume the experiments.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But won’t the manager scold us again?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh, don’t worry. Yesterday, I made this promise with Mister Braun. ’I swear there won’t be any more shaking today.’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In other words, the no-shaking promise only applied yesterday, so since today is yesterday’s tomorrow, we can shake it all we want!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That doesn’t settle anything. Why you’re so confident is a mystery to me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In other words, Christina, you want me to [color index="A0140000"]erase[color index="800000"] Mister Braun.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Besides, I don’t think a wimp like you stands a chance against him.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“He’s so muscley!”[%p]
Unfortunately, it’s impossible to experiment without shaking the building.[%p]
I have no choice but to negotiate with Mister Braun somehow. The other four members look at me in anticipation.[%p]
Are they planning to sacrifice me!?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is this the choice of Steins Gate? But how do I...”[%p]
While trying to think of a way to avoid talking to the manager, I wander over to the window and look outside.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hm?”[%p]
The street below is mostly empty.[%p]
A girl is polishing her bicycle in front of the building. A much younger girl is squatting next to her, watching her work. They’re alone.[%p]
I can only see the backs of their heads from here, but I know who they are.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey you! Part-Time Warrior!”[%p]
When I call her, Suzuha looks left and right while wiping the sweat off her brow before finally looking up here.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Sup!”[%p]
The girl beside her also looks up.[%p]
This cute little girl is Tennouji Nae, Mister Braun’s only daughter. Looks like she came to play with her father today.[%p]
I’ve always wondered how it’s possible for such a muscular man to spawn such a cute girl.[%p]
Nae bows her head when we make eye contact.[%p]
I return the nod, then call out to Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing there?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Can’t you tell? I’m polishing my bicycle!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aren’t you working today?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Of course I am. Why else would I be here?”[%p]
You’re polishing your bicycle even though you’re at work?[%p]
I mean, I guess the store barely has any customers.[%p]
To put it bluntly, was there even a need for a part timer?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What, is she still tinkering with that bike of hers?”[%p]
I can hear Kurisu’s sour voice from inside the lab.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“She was there when I came in, glaring at me.”[%p]
Looks like they’re still fighting.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Part-Time Warrior! Where’s Mister Braun?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Mister Braun? Who’s that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The manager of that junk shop you work at.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s not a junk shop. It’s a CRT specialty shop.”[%p]
My assistant’s so picky. “Junk shop” was just a joke to add a little Hououin Kyouma spice to the mix.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, so that’s who you meant. Ahaha.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Daddy’s name isn’t Mister Braun.”[%p]
The little girl diligently corrects us on her father’s name.[%p]
She must not get the joke.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The boss is on a service trip! I don’t think he’ll be back for a while!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wh-what!? Is that true!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s true! I wouldn’t be slacking off like this otherwise!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ah, Nae, don’t tell the boss I said that, okay?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Then let me ride your bicycle.”[%p]
It’s a blessing from the gods![%p]
I give my gratitude to Part-Time Warrior and shift my attention back inside.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You heard her. This must be the choice of Steins Gate.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mister Braun is currently absent. In other words, we can experiment to our heart’s content!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That doesn’t solve the problem, you know.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m telling you, it’s the choice of Steins Gate.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whatever. I want to try out the PhoneWave 2nd Edition v1.03.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Second attention verse erosion?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“2nd Edition v1.03.”[%p]
How did we get to 1.03?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Enough of your unsophisticated names. The upgraded version shall be known as Heavenly Merry-Go-Round.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The name doesn’t matter. Let’s just start the experi--”[%p]
The sound of a camera interrupts our quarrel.[%p]
Moeka has her phone pointed at us.[%p]
How many times have I told her not to take pictures!?[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...You looked like you were having fun.”[%p]
Mayuri smiles happily. Daru doesn’t react. Kurisu turns away in a huff.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hardly. I’m fed up with these people and their fooling around.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“This assistant is such a [color index="820000"]tsundere[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Who are you calling a tsundere!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh? Makise-shi, you know what tsundere means?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...N-no.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I think you do. It’s written all over your face.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Mmmgh...”[%p]
Kurisu bites her lip.[%p]
So she is familiar with otaku culture.[%p]
I wonder how she got that knowledge while living in America.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Experiment please.”[%p]
Moeka’s tired of waiting.[%p]
She’s shown great interest in the time machine ever since we told her the truth.[%p]
Of course, I made her promise never to write an article about it.[%p]
I threatened to take her phone away if she breaks her oath.[%p]
The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is ready to send a D-Mail whenever we are.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m setting it up so it forwards to Okarin’s phone.”[%p]
Daru types my phone’s mail address into the X68000’s keyboard.[%p]
We decided Mayuri was going to be the one to send the D-Mails, so she starts typing on her phone.[%p]
We set the microwave timer to “60#” and press start. Even though the door has been removed, the microwave runs like always.[%p]
The discharge phenomenon occurs, and Mayuri’s mail goes through the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s dedicated phone to mine.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“It really...”[%p]
Moeka stares at my phone in what I assume is disbelief, though it’s hard to tell given her lack of expression.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you think? This proves that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is an honest-to-goodness time machine.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka just keeps staring at my phone.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hey!”[%p]
Part-Time Warrior’s voice comes from outside the window.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s shaking again! And there’s a strange light, too! What are you doing up there!?”[%p]
I decide to ignore her.[%p]
Mister Braun is one thing, but she doesn’t scare me at all.[%p]
