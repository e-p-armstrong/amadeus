[name]Rintaro[line]“Now then, lab mems.”[%p]
I assemble all the lab members, including Moeka, for a meeting.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The 73rd Round Table Conference will come to order.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yesterday was the 66th. Where’d the other six go?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Only anal retentive bastards care about the minor details. That’s why you’ll never be more than an assistant, Christina!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Like I keep saying, I’m neither your assistant nor Christina.”[%p]
I ignore Kurisu’s complaints and proceed.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In the first stage of Operation Urd, we tested the limits of D-Mail technology.”[%p]
We discovered that we could only send up to 36 English characters.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Today, we advance to the second stage. Practical applications of D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Practical applications? I’ll send one to this morning so I can say ’Good morning, Okarin♪’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Like hell you will. Write that on the back of a leaflet or something.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But if it’s on the back of a leaflet, you won’t get it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When I say practical applications, what I mean is...”[%p]
I take a short pause to look at all four members. Then I lower my voice.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Changing the past.”[%p]
Shock ripples through the room.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Now hold on! It’s too dangerous! Are you trying to play god!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh? What’s so dangerous about it?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Let’s say you create a time paradox and blow up the world. What do you plan to do then?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, I guess we’d be dead.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re going to change the past so recklessly? Are you kidding me?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t tell me... you’re not seriously trying to bring chaos to the world or whatever, are you?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nah, he’s all talk. It’s fine to ignore him, Makise-shi.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“R-really?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Don’t worry! Okarin’s actually a very nice person. You’ll see!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t remember asking for an appraisal, but I’ll answer Christina’s question.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“My dream is to plunge the world into chaos. However, it is still far too early to bring that dream to fruition.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We can only send 36-byte emails. That’s not enough for my purposes.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Therefore, I shall set my ambition -- Project Chaotic -- aside for now.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Project... Chaotic?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Did you just come up with that?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Correct, Makise-shi!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“YES.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin just says the first thing that comes to mind. He’s always like that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t analyze me, Daru! And you, assistant! Stop that fist pumping! You making fun of me!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, so what are we going to do?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah. How do you want to change the past, anyway?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“First of all, the purpose of this experiment is to verify whether or not we can actually change the past. So it doesn’t matter how trivial the change is.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Have you heard of the Butterfly Effect?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah, it’s like that saying. ’When the wind blows, the bucket maker gains.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh? No, it’s kinda like that, but kinda not...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A butterfly flaps its wings in Beijing and a storm happens in New York, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yeah, that. Part of [color index="820000"]Chaos Theory[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Basically, any change, no matter how small, could have a significant effect on the future.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“How do you plan to take responsibility for that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Titor said that the many-worlds interpretation holds true.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And that makes it okay to change the past? You’re going to believe that self-proclaimed time traveler’s delusions?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you prove they’re delusions?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m asking what you’re going to do if they are. How are you going to deal with the consequences?”[%p]
Kurisu and I glare at each other.[%p]
For some reason, I always end up getting emotional whenever I argue with this impertinent assistant of mine.[%p]
Such weakness is unbefitting of an insane mad scientist. I need to calm down.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina, you said this before, did you not?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When hypotheses pile up, and theories are verified, they become reality. That’s how modern physics comes to understand the truth of the universe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re contradicting yourself.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No, I’m not.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We don’t even have a hypothesis for how the PhoneWave works.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We’re just fumbling around in the dark here. There are still too many risks to try changing the past.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We should wait until we know more.”[%p]
Oh? So she’s not unconditionally opposed?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re actually itching to try it out, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“W-well...”[%p]
Kurisu quickly looks away.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Besides, didn’t you want to prove that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) isn’t a time machine?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If it’s not a time machine, then it can’t change the past. You could prove yourself right, so why are you against it?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh shut up...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And if you’re going to talk about time paradoxes, then what about SERN?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They’ve already sent more than 100 people to the past. Surely a few paradoxes have happened by now.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So you want to stoop to the same level as the guys that did those inhumane experiments?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’re not doing human testing or anything, so relax.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um...”[%p]
Suddenly, Mayuri raises her hand. She was staring blankly at us this whole time, so I’m a bit surprised.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Okarin? Mayushii doesn’t really get it, but what are you going to change?”[%p]
Finally, some constructive conversation.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“My goal for this operation is simple. We, my friends...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are going to win the lottery!”[%p]
Everyone except for Moeka stares at me openmouthed.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m for it. If we win the lottery, I can buy all the computer parts I want and go to MayQueen for every meal of the day. We’d be stupid not to try it.”[%p]
That’s my super hacka![%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Money? Okarin... that makes Mayushii sad.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“We should do something that will bring peace to the world!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Like what if we give everybody in the whole wide world an Upa cushion?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph. Peace, you say? Don’t be ridiculous.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyo--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And here I thought you had ambition.”[%p]
Tch. I’m surrounded by idealists.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t get me wrong.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This isn’t about world peace and it isn’t about ambition. It’s about discovering whether or not we can change the past.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The easiest way to do that is to see if we can win the lottery, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But your primary goal is the money, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“With that kind of money, I could say goodbye to this rickety old building! Muhahaha! I could get an office in Daibiru or UPX!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“See? Just like I thought.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I won’t whitewash it. If we moved, we could experiment as much as we want without fear of Mister Braun. If we had money, we could build the Future Gadgets of our dreams.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And of course, we could buy a truckload of Mayuri’s favorite bananas.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“A t-truckload?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No, Mayuri-san! Don’t let him tempt you!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Shut it, Celeb Seventeen!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“S-se...? Serendipity?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Celeb. Seventeen.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What the hell is that supposed to mean!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You live in a hotel off of your parents’ money. You could never understand the plight of poor students like us.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu puts on a sulky expression.[%p]
“I’m 18 now!” she protests, but I ignore her.[%p]
It doesn’t matter if she’s eighteen. Celeb Seventeen sounds better![%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What do you think, Moeka-san?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
No reaction from Moeka.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Um...?”[%p]
Heh! Whatever my assistant was trying, it didn’t work. I have no idea what Moeka is thinking, but I’ll treat her lack of opposition as approval.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you’re going to complain, then suggest an alternative. A change to the past that would be both trivial and easy to understand. Got anything?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Um...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hmm?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Let’s try changing the hotel I’m staying at.”[%p]
Kurisu’s voice lacks conviction.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How are we supposed to know the difference? If you want to stay in Uguisudani, do it on your own. That should be easy for a Celeb Seventeen like you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Do you have to say it like that?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Anyway, why Uguisudani?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Because that’s where all the love hotels ar--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“One more word out of you and I excise your frontal lobe with a rusty scalpel.”[%p]
Holy crap. A [color index="820000"]lobotomy[color index="800000"]? That’s mad scientist territory.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Then how about we change my fried chicken to a different brand?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nobody cares what brand of chicken you eat.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Aw...”[%p]
Silence descends upon us.[%p]
Kurisu and Mayuri are still thinking, but I doubt they’ll come up with anything good.[%p]
As for Moeka, I can’t tell what she’s thinking, or if she’s even thinking at all. She’s just staring at her phone, motionless. She’s not even typing for a change.[%p]
Daru has already declared his support for me. Now he’s browsing moe news sites as if this whole thing doesn’t concern him.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Even with a time machine before you all, this is all you can think of. You guys sure lack imagination.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If there are no other suggestions, we’ll use my plan.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu frowns, but she doesn’t raise any more complaints.[%p]
As I thought. She, too, wants to know if we can change the past.[%p]
She’s a scientist through and through. And if I’m not mistaken, she has a bit of “mad” in her too! Muhahaha![%p]
I take out my phone and put it to my ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. We’re beginning stage two of Operation Urd.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, no problem. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall take all responsibility. Heh, don’t worry. Nothing will come back to you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Correct. This is my choice, and the choice of Steins Gate. Ragnarok is near. El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
I put my phone away and look at my lab mems.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now, begin the operation!”[%p]
Nobody moves a muscle. They just look at each other.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uh, what do you want us to do?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you incapable of doing anything without my instructions?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“First, we need to buy a lottery ticket.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No, first we need a winning number.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Exactly, Celeb Seventeen! Now you’re talking.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t call me Celeb Seventeen.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“First, we have to decide which lottery to go for. Think we should go for Dream Summer Jumbo?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I saw a TV commercial for that the other day!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did they announce the winners?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Should be next week or the week after.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then there’s no point! We can only send D-Mails to the past!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, right.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We could wait until the Summer Jumbo drawing date.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’ve got your priorities backwards. Don’t get fixated on Summer Jumbo. Let’s look at the last lottery that announced its winners.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmmm, I’ll google it.”[%p]
Daru starts searching on his computer.[%p]
Meanwhile, Kurisu is thinking hard.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If someone sent me the winning numbers from the future, would I believe it?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Mayushii doesn’t even know how to buy a lottery ticket...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s okay. I don’t think teenage girls buy lottery tickets.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you ever bought one, Moeka?”[%p]
When I call out to Moeka, standing alone in the corner of the room, her shoulders twitch.[%p]
Then she shakes her head a little bit.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“How about you, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I tried the LOTO SIX once.”[%p]
I didn’t even get a penny.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hey, LOTO SIX might work. I’m pretty sure they announce winning numbers every week.”[%p]
A quick search reveals that LOTO SIX announces winning numbers every Thursday.[%p]
They’ve also posted last week’s 1st through 7th place numbers on their homepage.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Are you going to send this winning number in a D-Mail?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Exactly. Though of course, we have to mention it’s for LOTO SIX.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm, last week’s 1st prize was... woah, 200 million!”[%p]
What!? 200 million!?[%p]
I think my heart skipped a beat there.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-wait! 1st prize is too much!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Why?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That [color index="A0140000"]is[color index="800000"] an awful lot of money... hahaha...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, not that. 1st place would be... too conspicuous.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t you get it!? I’m being chased by the Organization. If we win 1st prize, the media will cover the event and my cover will be blown!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s stupid.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What if Mayushii wins?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No. Stage Two of Operation Urd does have its risks, just like Celeb Sev said.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Celeb... Sev? Don’t abbreviate it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll be the winner. That way, I shoulder all of the risk.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And all of the money, right? I see your plan.”[%p]
I ignore Celeb Sev’s remark.[%p]
The prospect of pocketing 200 million yen is certainly appetizing, but that would be too big a change to the past. [%p]
Just like Celeb Sev said, we can’t ignore the Butterfly Effect. We should flap our wings as softly as possible.[%p]
I’m not scared or anything. Really.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, we should aim a little lower. Daru, how much is 2nd prize?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Umm, looks like it was... 23 million yen.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...L-let’s try 3rd prize.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That was only 700,000 yen.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, that’s good. That should be about right.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re such a chicken.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh, heh heh heh! That’s rich, coming from the one who was so worried about the risk of time paradoxes. Eh, Celeb Sev!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m begging you, stop calling me that. I’ll settle for assistant.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And don’t misunderstand. I’m still worried about what could go wrong.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m trying to minimize our risk by choosing an amount that’s just right. Stop being so stubborn.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...No, you.”[%p]
I decide to let Celeb Sev have the last word.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, could we fill a truckload of bananas with 700,000 yen?”[%p]
Nobody said anything about using the entire dividend on bananas, but it looks like Mayuri intends to do so. Let’s ignore the glutton for now.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“For 3rd prize, you need to get five matching numbers.”[%p]
Last week’s six winning numbers were 02, 12, 19, 34, 35, and 40. The bonus number was 08.[%p]
1st prize is for matching all six numbers.[%p]
2nd prize is for matching five numbers plus the bonus number.[%p]
3rd prize is for matching only five numbers.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Moeka. I assign to you your first duty as a new lab mem.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Eh...?”[%p]
Moeka stares at me. She clearly didn’t expect her name to be called.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Figure out what to put in the D-Mail. It needs to convince an unknowing me one week ago to buy into the LOTO SIX.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You are the mail demon, so this should be right up your alley.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka doesn’t seem that interested, but she nods.[%p]
We set the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to forward to my phone.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thursday last week... so about five days. Is that okay?”[%p]
Kurisu puts on her lab coat before checking the phone attached to the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The drawing was five days ago. It needs to arrive before that, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We’ll send it to one week ago. 7 days is 168 hours, so let’s round up a bit and enter 170#.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ummm, 1, 7, 0, #...”[%p]
Moeka has finished typing the email into my phone.[%p]
[margin top="190"][center]“021219343537”[linebreak]“Buy LOTO SIX”[linebreak]“sure to win!”[%e]
We replaced the number 40 with 37.[%p]
This way, we won’t get 1st or 2nd prize.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’ll have to do.”[%p]
We can only send 36 bytes. There’s only so much we can say.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“This mail’s kinda shady, huh? Ehehe!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...I’ll redo it.”[%p]
I stop Moeka from erasing the mail.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s fine. I don’t think there’s any other way. Though it is kind of shady.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Don’t worry! Okarin loves shady things, so it’s perfect!”[%p]
That’s not entirely incorrect, but it feels like she’s making fun of me.[%p]
In any case, our preparations are complete.[%p]
It’s hard to believe that this is all it takes to send emails to the past.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The time has come. Prepare to open Steins Gate!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s been bugging me, but what is that Steins Gate thing?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s Okarin’s catch phrase♪”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Steins Gate is Steins Gate. Nothing more, nothing less.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That doesn’t explain anything.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t complain about every little thing. That’s not important right now.”[%p]
I place my finger on the send button. My hands are shaking. I fight to keep them steady.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Starting up the microwave!”[%p]
I swallow hard.[%p]
The turntable begins to spin backwards as the microwave comes to life.[%p]
The timer ticks down.[%p]
163... 162... 161...[%p]
Change the past.[%p]
It seems very simple to do.[%p]
But just like Kurisu said, there’s no telling what might happen.[%p]
I said I’d take responsibility, but that was just talk.[%p]
If a time paradox does occur, it could do irreparable damage to the world I know.[%p]
150... 149... 148...[%p]
How am I supposed to take responsibility for that?[%p]
Lightning crackles in the air around us.[%p]
It’s working.[%p]
All I need to do is press the send button.[%p]
136... 135... 134...[%p]
I can’t stop now.[%p]
I want to see what lies beyond.[%p]
Curiosity pushes me forward.[%p]
There’s no way this will destroy the world.[%p]
There’s no way.[%p]
122... 121... 120...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“El Psy Kongroo!”[%p]
I press the button.[%p]
My phone displays a flying mail animation and the words “Sending mail.”[%p]
116... 115...[%p]
