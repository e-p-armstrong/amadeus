[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
A wave of vertigo washes over me. It feels as if my feet have left the ground.[%p]
Suddenly, my vision blurs, and everything turns monochrome.[%p]
Is the ground shaking?[%p]
Every cell in my body is screaming, “This is wrong!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin? Are you okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Mayuri’s voice brings me to my senses.[%p]
I realize that color has returned to the world.[%p]
What was that just now?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Are you okay?”[%p]
Mayuri waves her hand in front of my face.[%p]
After blinking several times, I notice I’m standing stock still, gripping my phone.[%p]
My phone should be displaying “Mail Sent,” but it’s not.[%p]
Instead, it’s showing the normal standby display.[%p]
Something isn’t right here.[%p]
I look around. I’m inside the lab.[%p]
The PhoneWave (name subject to change) isn’t on.[%p]
When I sent the mail, the timer read 115.[%p]
In other words, it should still be running for about two more minutes.[%p]
Yet now, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is silent.[%p]
I scan the room.[%p]
Other things feel wrong.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm...”[%p]
Just a few seconds ago, Daru was sitting in front of the X68000.[%p]
But now he’s sitting in front of the lounge computer.[%p]
Did he teleport? At least, I don’t remember seeing Daru get up and move to the lounge.[%p]
Kurisu is sitting cross-legged on the sofa, reading a massive technical book.[%p]
She should be in the development room too.[%p]
Moeka is standing at the edge of the development room.[%p]
Nothing particularly different about her.[%p]
Mayuri is next to me, looking at me with a confused expression.[%p]
This is wrong.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, how long have I been standing here?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Eh? What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just tell me.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hm... maybe 30 seconds?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“30 seconds? Really?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup. You suddenly ran over to the PhoneWave, then you took out your phone and started going ’haaah haaah!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Say that again, Mayushii.”[%p]
Daru calls out from the lounge.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh? You started going haah haah?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The haah haah part!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Haah haah!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“More sexy this time!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Stop it, perv.”[%p]
Kurisu and Daru are exchanging their usual banter.[%p]
How can these guys be so calm?[%p]
I just sent a mail that may have changed the past.[%p]
Why aren’t they interested in the result?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Th-that’s right, the mail!”[%p]
I quickly check my mail.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The mail arrived a week ago.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hm? What’s going on?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The money! Did I win the LOTO SIX?”[%p]
I search my memories, but turn up nothing.[%p]
No memories of buying a ticket. No memories of winning 3rd place. Nothing.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Celeb Sev, did I win 3rd place?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t call me Celeb Sev! And 3rd place of what?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...what?”[%p]
Again, this feeling of disconnect.[%p]
I approach Kurisu, who’s lounging on the sofa.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What did you say just now?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wh-what?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What the hell did you say just now!?”[%p]
Kurisu glares back at me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Got a problem? I asked what, and then you just--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Not that! You said ’3rd place of what’, right!? I mean 3rd place of LOTO SIX!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What?”[%p]
Kurisu gives me a puzzled look.[%p]
It doesn’t seem like she’s messing with me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru! I sent myself the winning LOTO SIX numbers just now. Didn’t I?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Holy crap!”[%p]
Daru’s eyes light up.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s brilliant, man! We can use D-Mails to make ourselves billionaires!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I could buy all the computer parts I want and go to MayQueen for every meal of the day! I AM SO PUMPED UP!”[%p]
...This is wrong.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, you were gonna buy a truckload of bananas... right?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“A truckload? Who’s gonna fill it up?”[%p]
...This is wrong.[%p]
I look at Moeka.[%p]
She’s staring at the floor like usual, but I don’t miss the confused glance she throws my way.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait! What happened to stage two of Operation Urd!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“By stage two, you mean an experiment to see if we can change the past, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“R-right! That’s it!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah, that’s why we’re all thinking.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“About what to send, so we can tell if the past has changed.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I think we should definitely go with Okarin’s LOTO SIX idea.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii thinks we shouldn’t be so greedy for dough.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ah, but when I say dough, I don’t mean like for baking.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I think we all know what you mean.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really? That’s great! So, instead of being greedy, we should do something that will bring peace to the world!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Like, if we gave everybody in the whole wide world an Upa cushion, I think everyone would be happy♪”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The only ones who’d be happy are little kids and Mayu-shi.”[%p]
What? What are these guys saying?[%p]
They’re acting like I never sent that D-Mail with the winning numbers.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... hello?”[%p]
The front door opens slowly, and Lukako sticks his head inside.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ah, it’s Luka-kun! Welcome♪”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Pardon the sudden intrusion...”[%p]
Lukako bows his head apologetically.[%p]
Mayuri, Kurisu, and Daru go into welcome mode.[%p]
Moeka... keeps staring at her phone.[%p]
But I’m not in any condition to greet Lukako.[%p]
I can’t stop sweating. And it’s not because of the heat.[%p]
I don’t know what’s going on anymore.[%p]
Questions keep spinning around in my head.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Did you decide to wear one of Mayushii’s costumes? That would make me happy♪”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ah, no, that’s not why I came...”[%p]
Lukako looks at me apologetically, like he wants to say something.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What is it?”[%p]
I reply mechanically. My mind is still blank.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Actually, Okabe-san... I mean, Kyouma-san, there’s something I need to apologize for...”[%p]
What could he have to apologize for?[%p]
Timidly, Lukako holds out his hand. And there, between his fingers...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah...!”[%p]
Is a LOTO SIX ticket.[%p]
And the numbers are the same as the ones in my D-Mail![%p]
I grab Lukako by his slender wrist.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where did you get this!?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“T-that hurts...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Don’t pick on Luka-kun!”[%p]
Mayuri gets between us.[%p]
I let go reluctantly.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What’s wrong with you, Okabe? You’re acting weird.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Is the heat getting to him?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry, Lukako, but I need to know. Where did you get that LOTO SIX ticket?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... you told me the numbers.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I... did?”[%p]
Lukako nods with teary eyes.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“You told me to buy them because they might win...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“R-really? When was that!?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“A week ago...”[%p]
Damn you, past me! What were you thinking!?[%p]
This wasn’t supposed to happen![%p]
However, the past certainly has changed.[%p]
...Or has it?[%p]
It seems like it has, but at the same time, the present seems to have changed too.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, did Luka-shi win the LOTO SIX?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow! Okarin’s a psychic!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t tell me... you sent the winning numbers with the PhoneWave?”[%p]
Her question makes no sense.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why are you asking me that? You saw me send them.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I did? What are you talking about?”[%p]
Disconnect. Our stories don’t match.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I sent the winning numbers in a D-Mail just now. We discussed it and decided that’s what we would do. You all watched it happen.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then the past changed. It actually changed.”[%p]
I glance at the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
There’s no denying it now.[%p]
That grotesque appliance, the bastard child of microwave and cell phone, actually changed the past.[%p]
We have the power of a god![%p]
Though I still don’t know why everyone else forgot about it.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hold on, Luka-shi! How much did you win!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“700,000, right? 3rd place.”[%p]
I answer with conviction.[%p]
However...[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um...”[%p]
Lukako begins fidgeting.[%p]
Something’s strange about his behavior.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m really sorry, Kyouma-san. Even though you told me exactly what to do, I...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Filled one of the numbers in wrong...”[%p]
Huh? He what?[%p]
I stare at the numbers on the ticket in Lukako’s trembling hands.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... if that ’18’ had been a ’19’, then it would’ve been 3rd place... just like Kyouma-san said.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nooo! So close! And yet so far!”[%p]
I’m pretty sure I sent it with a 19.[%p]
I’ll know if I check my phone’s send history.[%p]
I take out my phone.[%p]
And bring up the send history.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Huh? It’s gone! Why!?”[%p]
The D-Mail I sent has vanished from my send history.[%p]
Just like everyone’s memories.[%p]
The D-Mail should be there... but it’s not.[%p]
Almost as if it never existed in the first place.[%p]
