I ignore the worried stares of my lab mems and head outside for some fresh air.[%p]
I need to calm down and figure this out.[%p]
The ticket Lukako bought turned out to be 4th place.[%p]
The prize is just 5,000 yen.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hey there, Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
Suzuha calls out to me. She’s still polishing her bicycle.[%p]
Tennouji Nae is squatting next to her, watching her work with great interest.[%p]
Two questions come to mind.[%p]
One. How long has she been polishing that thing?[%p]
Two. Just how much free time does the Braun Tube Workshop have?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You look like you’ve been brainwashed. You okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Brainwashed? Me?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Well, there’s nobody else here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I suppose you’re right.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Which part?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Being brainwashed? Or nobody else being here?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Being brainwashed.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You... were?”[%p]
Suzuha suddenly steps up to me and grabs my face.[%p]
Then she forces my eyes open with her index finger and thumb.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nwohh!? Wh-wh-what are you doing!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Don’t move.”[%p]
Suzuha peers into my eye with a serious expression.[%p]
But a second later, she lets go and steps back.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’re okay. You haven’t been brainwashed.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“When you’re brainwashed, they usually put a chip on the inside of your lower eyelid.”[%p]
A... chip?[%p]
Immediately after saying that, Suzuha gasps and covers her mouth.[%p]
Then she puts her hand on my shoulder and gives me an embarrassed smile.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okabe Rintaro. Please keep that confidential.”[%p]
Don’t tell me. Is she...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So you’ve been captured by the Organization before. Just like me.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Huh? The Organization? Are you talking about SERN?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No! Say no more. I understand your pain all too well.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Y-you do?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The Organization’s secret brainwashing facility, known as Apocalypse of Galient. That place is a living hell.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t want to revive any suppressed memories.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Um, right. I don’t think it was called Apokawhatever, though...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But it certainly was a living hell.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can tell you’ll make a good comrade, Part-Time Warrior. The day of Ragnarok is near!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“C-cool!”[%p]
Suzuha lifts her hand in a halfhearted gesture of enthusiasm.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Suzuha, what’s ’brain watching’?”[%p]
Nae asks as she tugs on the hem of Suzuha’s clothes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh. I, Hououin Kyouma, shall be the one to answer that.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Eh!? No... that’s okay.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Nae hides behind Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ahaha! Looks like Nae’s afraid of you, Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You do well to fear me, Sister Braun, but you should also pay me respect. For I am the world’s most infamous mad scientist!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“You’re infamous?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Indeed. World leaders would kill to get their hands on my genius brain cells.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Wow...”[%p]
Still clinging to Suzuha’s waist, Nae opens her eyes even wider and gasps in admiration.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s how people talk when they’ve been brainwashed, Nae.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Eh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nonsense, Part-Time Warrior. My brain has not been washed since the day I was born.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Are you a liar, Mister Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t call me that!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You shouldn’t yell at children. Look, she’s shaking.”[%p]
But ’Mister’ makes me sound old.[%p]
I’m not even old enough to drink yet... what a disgrace.[%p]
No, there’s no point getting angry at a child.[%p]
I need to show composure as an adult.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re even more of a perv than Okabe! I’m not using ’-san’ for you any more!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m not a perv! I’m a pervy gentleman!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What does that even mean!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, guys? Do you think Okarin’s okay?”[%p]
I can hear voices from the second story window.[%p]
And since we can hear them clearly from here...[%p]
Suzuha starts chuckling.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You heard everything, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Sorry, sorry. I didn’t mean to eavesdrop, but I just couldn’t help it!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you hear about the time machine too?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, yeah. I heard. Way to go, you!”[%p]
She strikes my upper arm in what I assume is a gesture of encouragement.[%p]
What is “Way to go, you!” supposed to mean?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You haven’t told anyone, have you? If I can’t trust you to keep silent, I’ll have to take extreme--”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I won’t say a thing, I swear! Your secret’s safe with me!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Great. There’s just one thing I’d like to ask.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you see some kind of electrical discharge on the second floor just now?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Electrical discharge? You mean like yesterday’s rumbling?”[%p]
I nod.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It happened once before. You’re lucky the boss wasn’t around.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“It shook. It was scary.”[%p]
I ignore the little girl’s honest impression.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just now, about a minute ago, it should’ve happened again.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, really? I didn’t see the second time.”[%p]
Suzuha tilts her head quizzically, then turns back to her bicycle.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Maybe I was too preoccupied polishing my baby.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Did you see it, Nae?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Nope.”[%p]
Sister Braun frantically shakes her head.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You didn’t see the second one?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I didn’t see it.”[%p]
Disappointment spreads through me.[%p]
What does this mean?[%p]
Events I remember happening... didn’t.[%p]
The fact that I sent a D-Mail.[%p]
The fact that we argued over what to send.[%p]
But Kurisu herself remembers that I called her ’Celeb Sev’ during that argument.[%p]
Right after sending the D-Mail, I was hit by a feeling of vertigo.[%p]
That’s probably related somehow.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Did something happen?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...How much do you know about time travel?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...What do you mean by that?”[%p]
Suzuha seems slightly suspicious.[%p]
So I explain to her what happened just now.[%p]
Nae probably won’t understand a word of it, so I don’t think it’ll be necessary to silence her.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...I don’t believe it.”[%p]
Suzuha’s dumbfounded after hearing my explanation.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ve never heard of anything like that. Is it true? Are you telling the truth?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course. We’ve created a bona-fide time machine. And we were able to change the past!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nobody can deny our accomplishments. That’s right, nobody!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Geez! That’s not what I meant!”[%p]
Suzuha grabs at her own hair in frustration.[%p]
But then her expression turns thoughtful.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I don’t know if what you’re saying is true or not, but...”[%p]
She suddenly lowers her voice.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I think you should try asking John Titor.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...John Titor?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I mean, he’s a hot topic now, isn’t he? A time traveler from the future!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“He might know something. Since you’re both time travelers and all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see... You could be right! No, there’s no doubt about it!”[%p]
The undoing of past events could possibly be explained through the many-worlds interpretation that Titor talked about.[%p]
And come to think of it, it was Titor’s advice that led me to the IBN 5100.[%p]
He should be able to give me a hint this time too.[%p]
I quickly take out my phone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. John Titor may have come from the future to guide me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, that’s right. His arrival here in 2010 must be the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Who is he talking to?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Dunno. Who could it be? Maybe it’s someone from the future.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“From the future...!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Do you want to know who I’m talking to, Sister Braun?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“N-no, I...”[%p]
Nae shakes her head rapidly. She looks scared.[%p]
I respond with the weary expression of a mad scientist who has seen everything and lost much.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Good. Even if you are interested, never ask. I could tell you, but then I’d have to silence you. And I don’t want to have to do that to an innocent girl.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Come on, stop scaring her. She’s just a little girl.”[%p]
I assume Nae is frightened because of the aura of danger that follows me everywhere.[%p]
She’s right to be.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll get in touch with Titor immediately. Your advice is appreciated, Part-Time Warrior!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ahaha, was I useful? That’s gr--”[%p]
Part-Time Warrior’s eyes pop open mid-sentence.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh crap! The boss is back! The boss is back!”[%p]
I follow Suzuha’s glance to see a moped headed this way.[%p]
Judging by the sheer size of the driver, it must be Mister Braun.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Nae, if Manager asks, tell him I was doing my job!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Okay. But you have to let me ride your bike, okay?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okay, okay!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Good luck, Okabe Rintaro! I’m rooting for you!”[%p]
Suzuha pats me on the shoulder and rushes into the workshop.[%p]
Nae and I are left in front of the store.[%p]
The driver stops the moped and takes off his full-face helmet, revealing Mister Braun.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Welcome back, Daddy!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Nae! What did this nutjob do to you!?”[%p]
Manager leaps from his moped and interposes himself between me and his daughter.[%p]
His eyes are bloodshot.[%p]
My spine freezes. What a powerful aura of malice![%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“You son of a... how dare you make moves on my precious daughter!? I’ll kill ya!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-wait! I haven’t done anything!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Then why were you talking with Nae alone, huh!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We weren’t alone! Suzuha was here too! That girl was skipping work to polish her bicycle!”[%p]
Please forgive me, Suzuha. My life is too precious.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“...Is that true, Nae?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“She promised she’d let me ride her bike. So I gotta say she wasn’t skipping!”[%p]
Sister Braun ends up betraying Suzuha too.[%p]
The manager breathes a heavy sigh.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Skipping’s the only thing she’s good at, isn’t it? Worthless part-timer.”[%p]
It’s true I’ve never seen her actually do work.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, shouldn’t you apologize for making false accusations?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“What? Hell no!”[%p]
Tch, stubborn old man. He thinks he owns the place just because he owns the place.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Understand? I won’t let you off easy next time you make moves on my daughter.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I wouldn’t do something so suicidal.”[%p]
Mister Braun nods in satisfaction.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Nae, I bought some cream puffs, so let’s eat them together.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Okay!”[%p]
He parks his moped next to Part-Time Warrior’s bicycle, then enters the store hand in hand with his daughter.[%p]
Cream puffs? You can’t get any more out of character than that. Is this what having kids does to a man?[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Hey, part-timer! I know you were slacking off! Hey!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“And why is the 42-inch on!? I thought I told you to turn it off!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m sorryyyyy!”[%p]
I leave Suzuha to her fate and return to the lab.[%p]
