[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You look like a girl in love waiting for an email from her boyfriend.”[%p]
She sure likes to attack me for every little thing.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you really that desperate for attention?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Just getting revenge. You’re always making fun of me, so I deserve at least this much.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Despite what you may think, I actually respect you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s rich. You don’t even say my name right.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry about that.”[%p]
Kurisu lifts her face and stares at me in shock.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well, that’s unexpected... You actually apologized.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I do apologize. But I can’t help it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“For my brain has recorded you as my assistant, Christina, and I cannot correct it! MUHAHAHAHA!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m gonna crack your skull open and stick electrodes in your [color index="820000"]hippocampus[color index="800000"].”[%p]
Right after that silly exchange, John Titor’s mail arrives.[%p]
I quickly open the mail.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Who are you talking to?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“John Titor.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Huh? No way.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“He’s open to discussion as long as you’re not trying to troll him, and his mail address is public. This is the second time we’ve exchanged mails.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No wonder you keep referencing Titor’s posts. You believe him, don’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Not entirely. But there are several points in his story I do agree with.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Really? I can’t see it as anything but fiction.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
The tone of Titor’s mail has suddenly changed.[%p]
He thinks I have some kind of power?[%p]
First, I feel a sense of pride.[%p]
Next comes apprehension. Could this be a trap?[%p]
In the first place, I can’t confirm if this is the real John Titor. And I don’t even know if the John Titor from 2000 was really a time traveler.[%p]
If Titor’s worldline theory holds, then that [color index="A0140000"]could[color index="800000"] explain the supernatural events I’ve experienced.[%p]
But this last statement is pretty hard to swallow.[%p]
As soon as I begin to doubt, all of his words start to smell like lies.[%p]
That stuff about the IBN 5100 might have been a lie too. That mysterious program code could be just a simple bug.[%p]
Now that he claims I have special powers, he’s starting to sound like some new-age con artist.[%p]
And besides, I don’t need Titor to tell me that.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Muhahahahaha!”[%p]
Kurisu jerks at the sound of my laughter.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“D-don’t just start laughing like that. It’s creepy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hehehe, but I must! He says I have powers! Isn’t that rich!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You don’t have to tell me what I already know, John Titor!”[%p]
I snap my eyes open wide.[%p]
I raise my phone high to the heavens.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“My true power... is the magic eye, ’Reading Steiner’!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sounds to me like you’ve got a bad case of chuunibyou.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Eh?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu hides her face in her book.[%p]
She pretends to read, but I can see from here that her ears are bright red.[%p]
How does she know about chuunibyou?[%p]
Is she an @channeler after all?[%p]
No, that doesn’t matter now.[%p]
I need to reply to Titor.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Ok, now it’s getting creepy.[%p]
Is this some new cult?[%p]
Or is he really trying to con me here?[%p]
He’s also contradicting himself again.[%p]
The Titor who appeared in 2000 said he traveled back in time to retrieve technology lost in World War III.[%p]
Yet this guy’s saying he came to prevent the creation of a dystopia ruled by SERN.[%p]
This guy might be an impostor.[%p]
I’m fed up, so I quit replying. But just as I’m about to put away my phone--[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Tch.”[%p]
Another mail comes.[%p]
I open up my phone reluctantly while enduring Kurisu’s cold glare.[%p]
And what I read there...[%p]
Raises the hairs on the back of my neck.[%p]
What is this? Fear? Disgust?[%p]
I don’t know, but something is very wrong.[%p]
