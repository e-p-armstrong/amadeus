[name]Rintaro[line]“John Titor is a fraud!”[%p]
I scream at the absurdity.[%p]
Daru and Kurisu give me exasperated stares, but I ignore them.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Me, the Messiah? Hmph. Ludicrous! To think that [color index="A0140000"]I[color index="800000"] would save humanity!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am no Messiah! I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, who has walked through fire and bathed in an ocean of blood to escape the clutches of the Organization!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“My desire is chaos unending. Do you think that destroying the System will bring peace to the world? The answer is no! No, I say!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Death to the naive fools who believe such lies! The collapse of authority means that lawless CHAOS shall reign! MUHAHAHAHA!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Um, Makise-shi? What the hell happened to Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Beats me. A few hours ago, he was exchanging emails with John Titor, and then he suddenly got quiet.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And then he started ranting. He’s been like this for half an hour.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“He’s been acting strange all day, don’t you think?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Agreed.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Listen up, lab mems! It’s time to resume Operation Urd!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Seriously? The manager’s still downstairs, you know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Fret not. It’s almost closing time for the Braun Tube Workshop.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The PhoneWave doesn’t work at night, remember?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s worth a try! We need to figure out how late the PhoneWave (name subject to change) works.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“At the same time, I want to see if the two of you can use D-Mails to change the past.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Change the past...!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
I still don’t believe in the many-worlds interpretation or Titor’s attractor field theory.[%p]
Actually, I’m starting to doubt them more and more.[%p]
If we want to know how the world works, we’ll have to figure it out ourselves. And to do that, we need to experiment.[%p]
One thing I’m sure of is that the mass disappearance in Akiba is related to D-Mails somehow, as is the strange disconnect between my memories and everyone else’s.[%p]
According to Titor, I have a supernatural power -- the one I call “Reading Steiner.”[%p]
My doubts about Titor’s veracity aside, I do need to determine if I am indeed the only person who keeps his memories when the past changes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Change the past to your liking. As long as it’s something easy to observe.”[%p]
Preparations for the PhoneWave (name subject to change) are complete.[%p]
Daru’s eyes wander to the ceiling in thought. Next to him, Kurisu shrugs her shoulders and starts gathering her things.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m going back to my hotel. Show me your report on today’s experiment tomorrow.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hold it!”[%p]
When I grab her by the shoulder, Kurisu nearly topples over.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey! What’s your problem!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who’s writing that report?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You, of course. This is your operation.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And if we could get a report from the subject too, that would be even better.”[%p]
Kurisu glances at Daru.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Are you not interested in changing the past? What happened to your eagerness to experiment?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Did you forget what I said this afternoon? I’m against it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But you were so enthusiastic when we began the experiments. You went along without a single complaint.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In your dreams, maybe.”[%p]
I twist my lips into a grin.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re not being objective, Christi... Celeb Sev.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you’re going to correct yourself, at least get it right.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’ve already performed one experiment. I changed the past.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hey! No fair!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah, but you were in on it too. But when the past changed, you forgot that it had ever happened.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Are you talking about this afternoon? I mean, when you suddenly started asking about the LOTO SIX.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Exactly.”[%p]
I explain what happened earlier this afternoon.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...You’re not joking, are you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m serious.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...Seriously?”[%p]
One good look at my face, and Daru seems to understand I’m not joking.[%p]
Kurisu, on the other hand, has a sour look. But she’s always like that.[%p]
Why did everyone else lose their memories? Actually, [color index="A0140000"]did[color index="800000"] everyone else lose their memories?[%p]
In order to find out, I need them to perform the same experiment.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okay! There’s one thing about the past I definitely want to change.”[%p]
Daru is quick to adapt, as always.[%p]
We’ve known each other for a long time. He trusts me implicitly.[%p]
...Or maybe he’s just being faithful to his desires.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? Are you going to tell yourself to go on a diet?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I wouldn’t diet even if future me told me to.”[%p]
Daru tells me he wants to change the events of the “Faris Cup” held at MayQueen+Nyan² a few days ago. On that day, Daru got insta-killed by Faris in a RaiNet AccessBattlers match.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re gonna change the result?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I remember every move Faris-tan made. It’ll be easy to take her from behind. Aren’t I a genius?”[%p]
Hmm... Faris is probably too good for that to work. She’ll just counter his counter-strategy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whatever. Daru, prepare to D-Mail!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hell yeah! I’ll give it my best shot!”[%p]
Daru hunches over and starts typing out the mail, leaving me to input the forwarding address into the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
I sit in front of the X68000 and take a look at my watch.[%p]
It’s 6:55 PM.[%p]
No way to know if the PhoneWave (name subject to change) will operate at this hour.[%p]
We haven’t figured out the exact window yet.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So why do you think you’re the only one who remembers?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re awfully persistent. I see why they call you The Zombie.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t follow.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Zombies never stop coming. They’re persistent.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Cut the jokes. I’m serious here.”[%p]
Kurisu’s glare is scarier than usual.[%p]
I might’ve wet myself a little there.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I think that the key is who receives the D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Only the recipient himself is able to retain his memories. That would be my guess.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hmmm...”[%p]
Actually, that hypothesis doesn’t explain the mass disappearance in Akihabara.[%p]
Of course, I still don’t have concrete proof that the mass disappearance incident was related to D-Mail.[%p]
We’ll never know unless we experiment.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“After Daru, you’ll send the next D-Mail. Think about what you want to write.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No.”[%p]
Kurisu replies emphatically.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m not sending one.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Scared?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s not it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then are you worried about time paradoxes?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well, there’s that, but it’s more like a personal policy.”[%p]
A policy?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Changing the past feels like cheating.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I may only have 18 years of life experience, but I don’t want to change any of those memories.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see. You’re perfect now, so you don’t want to change.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s not what I said...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t want to deny who I’ve been. Because even my failures are a part of who I am today.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Even if we solved all of the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s problems, you wouldn’t use it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Even if John Titor said you could use his time machine to travel to whatever time you wish, you wouldn’t use it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Even if a blue robot cat from the future were to jump out of your desk and give you a doorway to everywhere, you wouldn’t use it?”[%p]
Kurisu nods firmly.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I wouldn’t.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But you love experiments. Don’t you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“S-something wrong with that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So basically, you like to experiment on other people while you watch and cackle at the results! You truly are a mad scientist!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why you--”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Done!”[%p]
Kurisu stalks towards me, but is pushed aside by Daru, who presents his phone with a triumphant grin.[%p]
I take a look.[%p]
[margin top="190"][center]“At Faris Cup”[linebreak]“Enemy setup:”[linebreak]“VLVVLVLL”[%e]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t get it.”[%p]
Me neither.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s how Faris-tan placed her cards. Can’t you tell? You guys are lame.”[%p]
Well, whatever.[%p]
Preparations are complete.[%p]
If this works, the mail will arrive at Daru’s phone 52 hours ago.[%p]
The discharge phenomenon occurs normally.[%p]
I close my eyes to shield them from the lightning and sparks.[%p]
The D-Mail was sent.[%p]
Daru should have received it two days ago.[%p]
However...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why do I remember?”[%p]
When I sent a D-Mail earlier this afternoon, everyone else forgot all about it.[%p]
If Daru’s D-Mail changed the past, then the present should have changed too. Daru should be the only one who remembers that he sent a D-Mail.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Did the past change?”[%p]
Daru looks around in confusion.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait. Daru, you remember too?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? Remember what?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That you just sent a D-Mail!”[%p]
Daru nods.[%p]
Then I turn to Kurisu.[%p]
She answers before I ask.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Of course I remember. What are you...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh, I see. According to your hypothesis, you and I shouldn’t remember sending the D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, did you beat Faris in the Faris Cup?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...I dunno.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You said the winner gets Faris’s home cooking, right? Did you eat it? What happened?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I don’t know... This sucks.”[%p]
I check Daru’s send history. As expected, the D-Mail he just sent isn’t there.[%p]
I do, however, find the D-Mail in his inbox. He received it two days ago, just like we wanted.[%p]
This is the same thing that happened when I sent my D-Mail.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Maybe the past hasn’t changed?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ll try calling Mayu-shi.”[%p]
He’s the one who changed the past, yet he doesn’t remember what happened after the change? That’s odd.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Mayu-shi? You’re still at work, right? Is Faris-tan there? ...She is!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Um, can you ask her if I beat her in the Faris Cup? Did I get to eat her home cooking?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...Who lost? I did? Oh... Barely took five seconds? Oh... okay...”[%p]
Daru’s shoulders droop as he hangs up the phone.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I guess that means the past hasn’t changed.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Why!? It changed for Okarin, right!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Maybe your foolproof plan wasn’t so foolproof. Like, maybe it only gave you a slight advantage.”[%p]
I had the same thought.[%p]
Faris is supposedly a world-class player.[%p]
Daru’s time travel cheat may not have been enough.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Since Faris-san defeated you anyway, the past didn’t change.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah, but I mean, the game would’ve played out differently.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That might not be enough to cause worldline divergence.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Like Okabe said, you need to make a change that’s easier to observe. Or else there’s no point to this experiment.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Um, n-not that I approve of this experiment or anything.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“No, it’s not over yet. I can still fight!”[%p]
Daru starts typing another mail.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“One more time. I’ll try sending my past self some more advice. This time, something that’ll ensure my victory.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You really want to win that badly?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“More like he wants to eat Faris’s home cooking that badly.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s my Final Answer.”[%p]
Daru writes another D-Mail.[%p]
I don’t bother checking what it says. I won’t understand anyway.[%p]
We activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and send the mail through, just like before.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh...?”[%p]
Nothing happens. No discharge.[%p]
Usually, it happens ten to twenty seconds after pushing the start button.[%p]
The timer counts down to zero without incident.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Out of time?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Looks like it.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But my advice was perfect...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s nothing we can do about it. We’ll postpone the experiment till tomorrow.”[%p]
I check the clock. It’s just past 7PM.[%p]
Looks like that’s the cutoff.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“After I left yesterday, I was thinking. How exactly does the PhoneWave make time travel possible?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It works like the LHC. Didn’t you say the LHC was like a giant microwave?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If every microwave could turn into the LHC, then Japan would have black holes popping up everywhere.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whoa, that sounds worse than earthquakes.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I know it looks like SERN is able to create Kerr black holes willy-nilly, but that’s not supposed to be possible.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You can’t just press a button and make a black hole. Even if you could, the risks would be unthinkable.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s ridiculous to suggest that a household microwave could generate a black hole.”[%p]
Titor’s time machine is small enough to fit inside a car, and it makes black holes.[%p]
Well, that’s what he said, at least. Now that I’m a little skeptical of Titor, I don’t feel like bringing it up.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“My point is that there has to be something else going on here.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Some outside source must be injecting electrons into this microwave.”[%p]
An outside source of electrons...[%p]
What could that be?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well, I’m going back to my hotel. I’ve had enough of this filthy man cave.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“See you tomorrow. Don’t forget to write that report.”[%p]
Kurisu flings off her lab coat and hurries out the door.[%p]
...She was serious about the report?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm... Makise-shi’s lab coat... I wonder what it smells like...”[%p]
As Daru reaches for the lab coat to smell Kurisu’s lingering fragrance, I grab him by the neck and pull down hard.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Cut that out! If you have time to be perverted, then go think about how to change the past for tomorrow’s experiment!”[%p]
