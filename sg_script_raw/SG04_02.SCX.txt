There wasn’t anything to do after Kurisu left.[%p]
I tried operating the PhoneWave (name subject to change) a couple more times before I went to sleep, but the discharge phenomenon simply would not occur.[%p]
Now it’s the next morning, and I’m sitting on the bench in front of the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
It’s still early, but it’s already blazing hot.[%p]
It’s as if I’m baking in the sun.[%p]
Sweat is dripping off my chin.[%p]
We’re supposed to be experimenting today, but not a single lab mem has arrived yet.[%p]
After waiting impatiently for a while, the first person I see is...[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Okabe! Don’t you have anything better to do?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Good morning, Mister Okarin.”[%p]
The Tennouji pair come riding in on a moped.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How many times do I have to tell you? Call me Kyouma!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Um... what should I do, Daddy?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“What nonsense are you trying to feed my daughter?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you not properly educated her, Mister Braun? This child of yours refuses to call me by my true name. Please do something about it.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Who cares? Don’t be so picky.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Nae, you don’t have to listen to what this guy says, okay?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Okay...”[%p]
The manager parks his moped and quickly enters the store.[%p]
Sister Braun’s about to follow him when--[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Ah.”[%p]
She turns her attention toward the end of the street and instantly brightens up.[%p]
I follow her gaze and see Mayuri walking this way.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Good morning, Okarin!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Mayuri!”[%p]
Nae runs up to Mayuri with a happy smile.[%p]
And without breaking stride, she jumps into Mayuri’s chest.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Good morning, Nae-chan.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Good morning.”[%p]
They get along so well that you’d think they were sisters.[%p]
Mayuri has the ability to get along with anyone, so it’s no surprise.[%p]
Nae avoids me and Daru, but she adores Mayuri, and always goes for a flying hug whenever she gets a chance.[%p]
Daru sometimes complains about that.[%p]
“What a lucky girl! I wish I could jump into Mayu-shi’s chest like that!”[%p]
“No, wait. Maybe it would be better to have Nae-tan jump into [color index="A0140000"]my[color index="800000"] chest!”[%p]
His internal debate went on for hours.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“This is for you, Nae-chan. Enjoy♪”[%p]
Mayuri takes some candy out of her convenience store bag and gives it to Nae.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Thank you!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I have some for Okarin too!”[%p]
She offers me some, which I silently accept.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Why are you sitting out here?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m waiting for all lab mems to assemble.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Um, are you slacking off?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Why you chipmunk! Do you have to be so blunt?[%p]
One of these days, I’ll teach you to respect me![%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Nae-chan? I’m sure Okarin’s thinking about important stuff.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Oh... wow!”[%p]
Good job, Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin, Okarin. It’s too early to make PhoneWave-chan sparkle, right?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Can I go nuke some yakisoba bread?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We removed the door. You can’t heat food in it anymore.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, right. That makes me sad...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“By the way, have you had breakfast?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nope.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Then let’s eat together. We can eat the yakisoba bread cold, and then heat up some [color index="820000"]canned ramen[color index="800000"] in hot water.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wanna join us, Nae-chan?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I’m okay. I ate.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay!”[%p]
Nae waves, then heads back inside the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
Lured by the prospect of canned ramen, I go inside the lab with Mayuri.[%p]
The stagnant air makes the room hotter than outside. It doesn’t improve much even after we open the window and turn on the fan.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Daru-kun and Chris-chan are kinda late, huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Indeed. Their lack of dedication is appalling.”[%p]
Just then, the sound of a braking bicycle comes from downstairs.[%p]
When I look out the window, I see Part-Time Warrior arriving.[%p]
She immediately notices me, looks up, and waves.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Sup!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪ Suzu-san.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If it isn’t Shiina Mayuri! Tutturu♪”[%p]
They seem to have hit it off.[%p]
Like I said, Mayuri gets along with everyone.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okabe Rintaro, did you talk to Titor?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Maybe.”[%p]
I thought I dodged the question, but Part-Time Warrior is persistent.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Come on! You emailed him, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes, but I’m starting to doubt whether he can be trusted.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What!? Why!? What went wrong!?”[%p]
Why is she so flustered?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, so you’re a Titor otaku.”[%p]
I guess there’s an otaku for everything.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Look, it’s Chris-chan!”[%p]
Mayuri leans out the window to wave her hand.[%p]
Kurisu is walking towards the lab.[%p]
That reminds me. Doesn’t Part-Time Warrior have something against Kurisu?[%p]
I look at Suzuha. Her expression has changed dramatically.[%p]
Now she’s staring at Kurisu in complete silence. She doesn’t move a muscle.[%p]
It’s like she’s trying to start a fight with her glare.[%p]
Kurisu’s pretty stubborn too, so she meets Suzuha glare for glare.[%p]
The two of them exchange a word or two in front of the building.[%p]
For a second, I’m worried that they might start throwing punches, but that doesn’t happen.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Chris-chan, tutturu♪”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Good morning.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What did you say to the part-timer downstairs?”[%p]
Kurisu shrugs her shoulders.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Nothing much. I told her if she wanted to say something, she should just say it.”[%p]
I don’t think that’s nothing...[%p]
She’s lucky that didn’t lead to blows.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What did she say?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Nothing. She just groaned. I wonder what’s wrong with her.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“She’s jealous of Makise-shi’s popularity, duh!”[%p]
Daru bursts into the lab.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“She’s thinking ’If only I’d joined the lab instead of her. Then I would be having fun with everyone right now! I’m so jealous!’ or something like that.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m telling you, man. 3D is hell.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If she wants my lab mem number, she can have it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What!? The lab mem number you carry is the highest credential a scientist could hope to achieve! They sell for millions on the black market, but you would give it away!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s not exactly a counterfeit passport. Also, shut up.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii wants everyone to get along.”[%p]
Well, I don’t really care about their little quarrel anyway.[%p]
Only one thing interests me now: the mystery of D-Mail.[%p]
