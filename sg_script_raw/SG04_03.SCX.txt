We begin experimenting immediately. Even though it’s still morning, the electrical discharge occurs on demand.[%p]
Things look favorable today.[%p]
That reminds me. We haven’t talked to Mister Braun yet.[%p]
Maybe we should come up with an excuse first.[%p]
To be honest, though, I don’t care what he thinks.[%p]
For we are at war! War against the Organization and SERN, the dark powers that rule the world from the shadows![%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“[color index="820000"]Anzai-sensei[color index="800000"], I want to eat Faris-tan’s home cooking...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“If you give up, it’s game over!”[%p]
Unfortunately, Daru’s second D-Mail fails to change the past.[%p]
I get the feeling RaiNet matches are difficult to cheat your way out of like this.[%p]
Not to mention we’re limited to 36 bytes of text.[%p]
Looks like we have to give up on Daru. He’s gone to drown his sorrows in the internet.[%p]
Alright, so who do we experiment on? From the look on Kurisu’s face, I don’t think she’s willing to change her policy.[%p]
That leaves only one candidate.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, it’s time for you to change the past.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Eh? Me? Are you sure?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But, um... what should I change?”[%p]
Mayuri looks stumped as she slurps her canned ramen.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, I know! I’ll make Luka-kun wear one of my costumes!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“By sending Luka-kun a mail! Ehehe!”[%p]
I don’t think a simple request is going to change the past...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can’t you think of anything easier to change and observe?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hmm...”[%p]
She slurps more ramen.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Let’s use that canned ramen.”[%p]
Looks like I’m the only one with ideas.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’ll send a D-Mail to yourself one hour ago. Type ’I wanna eat canned oden’ or something like that.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t think that’s enough to convince her to--”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, that might work!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh...?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“When I went to the vending machine today, I spent ten minutes wondering if I should get canned oden or canned ramen. It was really hard!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So a little push should be enough to make you choose canned oden! Alright, let’s go with that!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay! But before we change the past, I gotta finish this ramen first.”[%p]
Mayuri starts shoveling the ramen into her mouth.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What happens if you don’t finish it?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’ll go to waste♪”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh... of course. Ahaha...”[%p]
Kurisu clearly doesn’t know what to say.[%p]
Mayuri really is a ditz. I’m used to it by now, of course.[%p]
I get the PhoneWave (name subject to change) prepped for D-Mail.[%p]
The content of Mayuri’s mail is simple enough.[%p]
[margin top="190"][center]“Canned oden!”[linebreak]“Piping hot &”[linebreak]“Delicious!!!”[%e]
I just hope it actually works.[%p]
We wait for Mayuri to finish eating her canned ramen, then activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
To send it one hour back, we input “1#”. In other words, we set the microwave for only one second.[%p]
I wonder if the discharge phenomenon will occur in such a short span of time.[%p]
That’s something else we’ll learn from this experiment.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“PhoneWave (name subject to change), activate!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Aw... I haven’t sent it yet...”[%p]
There wasn’t enough time to blink.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So one second isn’t enough for the discharge to occur. That’s what I expected, but it’s good to have proof.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What if you try warming it up beforehand?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Warming it up?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“One second isn’t enough, right? So just run the microwave for about 30 seconds without sending a mail.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“As soon as it’s done, run it again with the timer set at one second. That should cause the discharge, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Any basis for that?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nope.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn. Mayuri, got anything else!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, well... we could change the flavor of rice ball I bought last night...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you remember what kind of rice ball you ate last night?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Smoked tuna.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“She remembers!?”[%p]
Impressive.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So let’s change that to, um... fish eggs!”[%p]
...Maybe we should find another test subject.[%p]
Something is telling me we’re going to have to look outside the lab.[%p]
