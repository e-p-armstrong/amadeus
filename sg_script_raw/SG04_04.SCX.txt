I go for a walk to clear my head.[%p]
After lunch at [color index="820000"]King Burger[color index="800000"], I grab a coffee at the [color index="820000"]Starbecks[color index="800000"] on the first floor of Yodobashi.[%p]
I left Mayuri and the others at the lab.[%p]
I need some time to get my thoughts in order.[%p]
I recall what happened when I sent myself the LOTO SIX numbers. The moment I sent that D-Mail, I felt a strong tremor, and then the world as I knew it “changed” slightly.[%p]
The fact that I had sent a D-Mail had been undone.[%p]
I know that because it had disappeared from my send history.[%p]
However, it was in my inbox. The mail had definitely reached the past.[%p]
What does this mean?[%p]
The mail was received but never sent. Isn’t that a time paradox?[%p]
Is that the reason why everyone else lost their memories?[%p]
Why did that happen?[%p]
The Butterfly Effect? That’s not an answer.[%p]
Changing the past changed the world. Titor spoke of divergence. When divergence changes, are people’s memories reconstructed to match the new “worldline”?[%p]
Then how come I remember the previous worldline even after the past changes?[%p]
My deliberations are interrupted by an incoming mail.[%p]
...Tch. I don’t have time for this.[%p]
It’s a mail, so I can just reply to it later. I concentrate on my coffee.[%p]
However...[%p]
All these mails...[%p]
No doubt about it. It’s got to be Kiryu Moeka, the mail demon known as Shining Finger.[%p]
How can she be so shy in real life and so persistent in email?[%p]
There’s something wrong with that woman.[%p]
I sigh and open my mail reluctantly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
She wants to send a D-Mail?[%p]
That reminds me. Yesterday, I made Moeka Lab Mem 005.[%p]
That means she’s qualified to participate in our experiments.[%p]
Moeka seems serious, so she might meet my demands.[%p]
Most importantly, all the other lab mems are completely useless when it comes to D-Mails.[%p]
I still haven’t been able to verify whether or not I can keep my memories if someone else changes the past.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But wait...”[%p]
I’m worried.[%p]
Moeka works for an editorial company. In other words, she’s related to the media.[%p]
What if she sends a D-Mail and leaks word of the time machine?[%p]
We’d be flooded by press. Gone will be the days of lurking in the shadows.[%p]
My location will be exposed to the Organization.[%p]
Of course, sooner or later we’re going to have to announce our findings to the world.[%p]
But in that case, I’d rather choose a national newspaper or TV network to cover the event rather than some shady magazine. That way, it’ll spread faster throughout Japan -- nay, the world.[%p]
Either way, something tells me it’s better not to go public through Moeka.[%p]
However, Moeka is a lab mem.[%p]
Yesterday, we told her everything about the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and D-Mails.[%p]
Moreover, we made her one of us.[%p]
It was necessary to buy her silence.[%p]
Realizing that I have no reason to deny Moeka her request, I put my phone to my ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. Yeah, I have some doubts. What? You can tell by my voice? Hmph, you know me too well.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, about whether or not I should include Shining Finger in the PhoneWave (name subject to change) experiments...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What? Nonsense. You want me to offer her as a sacrifice? True, I am prepared to make sacrifices in order to bring chaos to the world, but...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...No, there’s no problem. I shouldn’t have hesitated. Pathetic. Maybe I’m not cut out to be a mad scientist.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yeah, you might say her offer was a message. No doubt this too is the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
It’s decided. I type a reply to Moeka’s mail.[%p]
After sending it off, I hurry back to the lab.[%p]
