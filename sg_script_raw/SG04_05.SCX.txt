When I get back to the lab, Moeka is squatting at the bottom of the staircase.[%p]
Since she’s not sitting on the bench, I guess that crouching while holding her knees is this particular woman’s favorite position.[%p]
She’s staring at her phone like usual.[%p]
Once she notices me approaching, she slowly stands up.[%p]
But she doesn’t look at me.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Thank you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“For what?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t think you’re selfish. In fact, I’m grateful for your offer.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Once we enter the lab, I get all the lab mems to stop what they’re doing, and then tell them about Moeka’s situation.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I think it’s a good idea! Moeka-san is a lab mem too!”[%p]
Daru and Kurisu don’t object either.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So, what sorta mail does Kiryu-shi plan to send?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“My request is that its contents be simple and easy to measure, so that we can confirm whether or not the past changes.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
A new mail.[%p]
Why does she have to explain every little thing with a mail?[%p]
No, more importantly...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A secret? What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What’s going on?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, that’s not the problem.”[%p]
Kurisu peeks at my phone from beside me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hmmm, I see.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I understand how you feel, but since this is an experiment, data collection should take priority.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh? We agree for once, assistant.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I-I’m not [color index="A0140000"]agreeing[color index="800000"] with you, exactly. If we don’t collect data, then we’ll never figure out how the PhoneWave works.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But girls have lots of secrets, you know?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You shouldn’t ask her to tell her secrets, Okarin. That’s perverted!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whoa! Is that where we’re going with this!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Calm down, Daru!”[%p]
I turn to Mayuri and Moeka, who appear to have formed some kind of mainstream girl alliance.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’re not asking you to send something private.”[%p]
Kurisu nods firmly at my words. Looks like she doesn’t intend to join the mainstream girl alliance.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Even if you want to send something private, you shouldn’t for now. We still don’t know how this thing handles paradoxes, so we need to be extremely careful.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Nothing private?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Nothing you want to keep secret, at least. Even if you mean well, the mail’s content might have a serious effect on the timeline.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You should show your mail to a third party and have them check if the content is problematic or not.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Indeed. My assistant said everything I wanted to say. I will add only that the experiment must go on!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I wasn’t speaking for you. Don’t misunderstand.”[%p]
Cheeky little...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Experiments prioritize data over privacy in the first place. If you’re going to be a test subject, you need to be prepared for that.”[%p]
Don’t tell me that’s the reason Kurisu won’t send a D-Mail herself.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really? Mayushii wasn’t prepared for that...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m sorry, Chris-chan...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You don’t have to apologize. I’m not criticizing you. It’s just how these things work.”[%p]
I imagine some people might take issue with that statement, but I’ll refrain from saying anything. I’d rather not get my head chewed off right now.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka’s expression doesn’t change.[%p]
Same as always. I don’t know what she’s thinking.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re a lab mem. You need to trust us. Save private information for another day.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you can’t... then I’ll be forced to show you what lies dormant inside of the great Hououin Kyouma -- the terrible power of insanity!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka is already typing on her phone. My threat was ineffectual, it seems.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, I can show you my arrival history.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...And the send history?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t have one. The send history disappears after you send the email.”[%p]
I confirmed that after I sent that D-Mail yesterday. Moeka was there, but she doesn’t remember either.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Looks like she understands.[%p]
I show the mail to Kurisu too.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You don’t have to if you don’t want to, Moeka-san.”[%p]
Is that supposed to be encouragement? Mayuri sounds concerned for some reason.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So, whatcha gonna send? Okarin wants us to change the past in an easy-to-measure way, but that’s setting the bar way too high.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nonsense. You’re all just aiming too low.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I... have an idea.”[%p]
Moeka murmurs.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh? This could be good. Give us the details.”[%p]
Moeka then invokes her power once more.[%p]
Ultra-fast typing. The power known as Shining Finger.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Excellent, Shining Finger! You’re a model lab mem!”[%p]
This should make it easy to tell whether the past has changed.[%p]
Looks like the three useless members have no objections to Moeka’s superior idea.[%p]
We look at Moeka’s phone.[%p]
It’s purple and gaudy.[%p]
There’s no strap, and it’s not like the [color index="820000"]deco phones[color index="800000"] popular among mainstream women nowadays.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, that’s the GG01 that just came out last month.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Gee Gee Zero One?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The latest model. Pretty sure the screen is detachable, so you can swap out attachments for it.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s in short supply right now, so you need to be placed on a waitlist. Nice job getting one.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
It’s the most popular model, but she wants her old one back?[%p]
I guess hardcore phone users have other concerns besides fashion.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, Finger.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, why do you call Moeka-san ’Finger’?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s the name of her esper power. Kiryu Moeka, I dub thee Shining Finger! Use this name with pride.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka shakes her head expressionlessly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? You don’t like it? But it’s such a cool name. What’s the problem!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Moeka-san is Moeka-san. Her fingers don’t shine or anything...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Don’t feed the trolls, Mayu-shi.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not trolling, just naming her power.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Cut the chatter and get started.”[%p]
Gh, dammit. You’re just an assistant. Don’t boss us around![%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What if the manager says something?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Muhahaha! Don’t be afraid of Mister Braun! If he storms in yelling, I’ll kick him to the curb!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Seriously? Okarin, you’re so cool! That’s why we love you!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“He’s just talk.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I’ll be the adult and ignore Kurisu’s insult.[%p]
Moeka has already written her 36-byte mail.[%p]
When I look at Moeka to see if she’s ready, she nods faintly.[%p]
We set the timer to 100 seconds. The D-Mail should arrive at Moeka’s phone four days ago -- July 31st.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“PhoneWave (name subject to change), activate!”[%p]
About 15 seconds after activation, the discharge phenomenon occurs.[%p]
I glance at Moeka.[%p]
She nods grimly, an unusual show of emotion.[%p]
And then, she presses the button.[%p]
