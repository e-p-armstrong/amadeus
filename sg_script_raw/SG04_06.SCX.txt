The world twists into unrecognizable shapes.[%p]
The floor is shaking.[%p]
Or is it me?[%p]
My vision blurs and loses color.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Guh!!”[%p]
The world lurches. I struggle to keep my balance.[%p]
As I brace myself against further shaking, I try to analyze what I’m experiencing.[%p]
This is far more intense than what happened when we sent the D-Mails yesterday.[%p]
And yet, I’ve felt it before.[%p]
I remember.[%p]
This is what I felt right before the mass disappearance phenomenon.[%p]
The shaking stops.[%p]
I relax my body and look around.[%p]
Has the past changed?[%p]
Of course it has.[%p]
That bizarre sensation just now was proof.[%p]
I look around the room.[%p]
The PhoneWave (name subject to change), which should have about 90 seconds left on the timer, is silent.[%p]
Daru’s here. Mayuri’s here. Kurisu’s here.[%p]
...Where’s Moeka?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where’s Shining Finger? Where’d she go?”[%p]
Daru and Kurisu, who are discussing something in front of the X68000, look at me strangely.[%p]
Ah...[%p]
Again.[%p]
This feeling of [color index="A0140000"]wrongness[color index="800000"].[%p]
It’s the same as yesterday.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Shining what?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin. Japanese please.”[%p]
I leave the development room and check the lounge, behind the sofa, in the dressing room, the bathroom, and the shower room. I look out the window at the street below.[%p]
But Moeka is nowhere to be found.[%p]
She’s... gone.[%p]
No way.[%p]
This is exactly what happened on the streets of Akiba.[%p]
Why did she disappear!?[%p]
Because I experimented on her!?[%p]
Where did she go!?[%p]
Did I erase her from history!?[%p]
Did I banish her into the space between dimensions!?[%p]
I start quivering in horror at the magnitude of my error.[%p]
In a daze, I step up to Mayuri, who’s eating a banana.[%p]
I grab her shoulders and shake her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where’s Kiryu Moeka? She was here just now, wasn’t she!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Uhwhaaa?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Whoooo?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kiryu Moeka!”[%p]
Daru and Kurisu give me strange looks as well.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Who’s that?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Never heard of her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...No way.”[%p]
So I did erase Moeka’s existence...[%p]
No... that can’t be.[%p]
I won’t accept that I killed her![%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Did it happen again, Okabe?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean, ’again’?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Something like this happened yesterday. You remembered something we didn’t. Uh, what did you call it?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh yeah, Reading Steiner.”[%p]
Yes, that’s the name I gave this phenomenon -- or rather, to my ability to perceive it.[%p]
When the worldline changes, everyone’s memories are reconstructed to match. That’s what John Titor said.[%p]
But somehow, I alone retain my memories even after the past changes.[%p]
I named this power Reading Steiner. Kurisu remembered.[%p]
To tell the truth, I just made it up out of thin air.[%p]
But now that Moeka has disappeared, I want to believe that this power is real.[%p]
It’s only their memories of Moeka that disappeared! Not Moeka herself![%p]
I need to contact Moeka. I need to make sure I didn’t erase her very existence.[%p]
But I don’t know her phone number.[%p]
The only way to contact her is by mail.[%p]
I send her a message saying “Reply the second you read this email.”[%p]
Now all I can do is wait for her reply.[%p]
Please, reply...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Are you okay? You’re really pale.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-yeah... I’m fine.”[%p]
In fact, I’m anything but fine. I’m fighting desperately to deny the possibility that I might have erased Moeka from existence.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Assistant, how much do you remember about the experiment we just did?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t remember doing any experiments today.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You sent a D-Mail just now, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But things are different from yesterday. I didn’t send the D-Mail. Kiryu Moeka did.”[%p]
And then she vanished into thin air.[%p]
Which reminds me. When I sent the LOTO SIX mail yesterday, Daru teleported from the development room to the lounge.[%p]
Moeka might not have disappeared. She probably just teleported somewhere.[%p]
I hope that’s it.[%p]
In an attempt to calm myself down, I check my phone’s history for the mails Moeka and I exchanged.[%p]
That’s strange.[%p]
The mails she sent me are there, up until the one I received on July 31st at 12:43.[%p]
But after that...[%p]
The dozens of mails I remember receiving from her are gone.[%p]
The D-Mail she sent to cancel the phone model exchange was set to arrive on July 31st.[%p]
Did a time paradox erase Moeka from existence the instant she received the D-Mail?[%p]
I shiver when I realize that I can’t find any problems with that hypothesis.[%p]
No way.[%p]
It can’t be.[%p]
I mean, all her D-Mail said was “don’t change phone models.” That’s harmless, right?[%p]
But then, what caused Moeka to disappear from this room like that?[%p]
Why does it look like Moeka vanished four days ago?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina. Let’s say a D-Mail caused a time paradox. What would happen?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I don’t know. No one has experienced a time paradox, after all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But before, didn’t you say something like the world would disappear?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“All I said was that that was one theory.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Maybe nothing happens, and like in a certain movie, history gets amended to accommodate the paradox.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“According to Dr.Hawking’s [color index="820000"]chronology protection conjecture[color index="800000"], it’s impossible to do anything that might cause a time paradox in the first place.”[%p]
So all we have are theories...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Mayushii doesn’t really understand...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But we’re all fine now, right? I don’t think that paradox thing happened.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii doesn’t know who Moeka-san is, but I’m sure she’s okay too♪”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s Mayu-shi for you. A cute dumb girl.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehh? Mayushii’s not dumb!”[%p]
I’m amazed that Mayuri and Daru can have such a carefree conversation despite all that’s happened.[%p]
They don’t realize the gravity of the situation.[%p]
We might have erased someone’s very existence![%p]
In fact, if Moeka really has vanished, then that means the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is also responsible for the mass disappearance phenomenon I witnessed in Akihabara.[%p]
What if I erased all those people?[%p]
I don’t want to consider such a frightening possibility, so I desperately shake the thought out of my head.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
A mail! Is it Moeka!?[%p]
I check the mail with hope in my heart.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Ha, haha.”[%p]
My body goes limp from relief.[%p]
A reply. She sent a reply.[%p]
Moeka still exists.[%p]
She didn’t disappear.[%p]
Relief washes away my fear.[%p]
My eyes fill with tears. Not because I was worried for Moeka, but because I thought I might be responsible for the horror of erasing someone’s existence.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Explain what happened, Okabe.”[%p]
Urged by Kurisu, I explain everything that just happened.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hmmm.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Honestly, I’m not surprised she disappeared from the lab.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t know the details, but when the past changed, Kiryu-san’s actions these past four days changed ever so slightly.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“As a result, the timeline was reconfigured so that Moeka-san didn’t come to the lab today.”[%p]
So that’s why it looked like she teleported?[%p]
I’m reminded of the teleporting gelbana, but I guess it’s not the same thing.[%p]
Moeka didn’t become a jellyman, after all.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Is that even possible?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t know. If the fact that the D-Mail was sent is undone, then it becomes a paradox of who sent that D-Mail...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And there’s one other thing that I don’t understand.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What you call Reading Steiner.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“By the way, you should quit it with that name. It’s stupid.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph, I didn’t ask for your opinion.”[%p]
I’m finally able to joke with Kurisu again.[%p]
Well, maybe she wasn’t joking.[%p]
But that’s none of her business.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“By your explanation, you neither sent nor received the D-Mail. Yet how come you’re the only one who remembers what happened before the worldline changed?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What if it’s all in your head?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Like an imaginary girlfriend. I get it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No you don’t. I’m not a ’gentleman perv’ like you, creating imaginary relationships.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Maybe this Kiryu-san never existed. Or maybe Kiryu-san does exist, but the fact that she sent a D-Mail was something you made--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gwaaaah!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...eh?”[%p]
I fall to my knees and press my hand against my left eye.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ugh, ggh... my left eye, Reading Steiner, it aches!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin, are you okay?”[%p]
Mayuri peeks anxiously at my face. But I lightly push her aside.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, Mayuri! S-stay away! I don’t... want to hurt you!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But Okarin, you look like you’re in pain...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...He’s messing with us, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Y-yeah...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I-I’m okay... This aching is normal... it’ll end soon!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“As long as I have this magic eye... the Organization will keep coming after me! It’s the power to see across time and space... but at the same time, it’s a double-edged sword!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Because of this all-seeing eye... I have lost my connection to causality. I drift alone in the space between worlds.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But even so... I swore to protect this lab! So quiet thy fury, Reading Steiner! Your time will come... but not yet.”[%p]
I kneel and press my head against the floor.[%p]
And then I take a deep breath, and gradually remove my hand from my left eye.[%p]
Mayuri rubs my back.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin? Does it hurt?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No... I’m okay now.”[%p]
I stand up. Then I shoot Kurisu a sharp glare.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“W-what? That was just an act, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You are wrong, Christina.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Our experiments have already proven...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That I...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That my Reading Steiner is genuine!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Fine, I get it. You’re a chuunibyou patient.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Eh?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hm?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ah...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wh-why are you all staring at me? Don’t look at me!”[%p]
In any case, I’ve successfully deflected Kurisu’s questions about Reading Steiner.[%p]
I don’t feel able to answer right now. My emotions are a jumble, just as they were after Titor called me the Messiah.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]Is this power real?[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]If it is, then what does that make me?[%e]
An unknown power sleeps within me.[%p]
The thought sends a chill down my spine.[%p]
