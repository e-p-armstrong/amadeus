I sit on the bench in front of the Braun Tube Workshop, staring into the night sky.[%p]
I try sorting out what happened this afternoon.[%p]
But it’s impossible.[%p]
The more I think about it, the more confused I get.[%p]
And then I hear footsteps coming down from the second floor.[%p]
Soon, Mayuri and Kurisu emerge.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Going home?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Do you always stay the night here?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Pretty much. I wouldn’t be a true mad scientist if I couldn’t stay overnight at my lab, immersed in research.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I think you’re putting too much emphasis on appearances.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But you know, this place is really convenient. Mayushii would stay over if mom and dad let me.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Y-you would?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And it’s so close to work too♪ Hey, Chris-chan, why don’t we all stay over some time?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sure, if the guys aren’t around.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That won’t happen.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then why don’t you come to my hotel, Mayuri-san?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh yeah, we did make that promise, huh? Ehehe! Then let’s do that next time♪”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You can come whenever you like. See you tomorrow.”[%p]
Kurisu waves goodbye and starts walking in the opposite direction from Akihabara Station.[%p]
Mayuri doesn’t move from that spot.[%p]
Instead, she starts doing her usual thing -- Stardust Handshake.[%p]
She looks up to the night sky, raising her hand as if to grasp the stars.[%p]
And with perfect timing, a shooting star crosses the sky.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...Hey, Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. A shooting star. Did you make a wish?”[%p]
Mayuri doesn’t answer.[%p]
She keeps gazing at the sky.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Remember how back in elementary school, you got a terrible fever and stayed in bed for a month?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why are you bringing this up?”[%p]
It was about ten years ago, at the turn of the century, when the world was in an uproar over Y2K.[%p]
Near the end of 1999, I had a fever of nearly 40-degrees-C that lasted about a month. I didn’t recover until the new year.[%p]
At least, that what I’ve been told. I don’t remember it myself. According to my parents, I was unconscious the whole time, tossing and turning. The doctors said it was a miracle I didn’t die.[%p]
Because of that fever, I didn’t get to experience the millennium countdown event.[%p]
They never figured out what caused it either.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I was so afraid that Okarin might die.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So Granny and I prayed to the sky together. ’Don’t die, Okarin.’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh, something like that could never kill me! Ten years ago, I was already a mad scientist with an IQ of 170, equaling that of Thomas Edison!”[%p]
Actually, I’m not sure what Edison’s IQ was.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really? That’s amazing!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But Mayushii was still really small, and didn’t know that, so I prayed to the sky.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And then, on New Year’s Eve, right before midnight, a shooting star went pewww across the sky. Just like now.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“If you repeat your wish three times before a shooting star disappears, your wish will come true. Did you know that?”[%p]
Of course. That’s the most common of common knowledge.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It was hard, but Mayushii repeated her wish three times.”[%p]
Then Mayuri finally lowers her hand and turns to me.[%p]
On her face is a soft smile.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The next day, on New Years, your fever went down, and you woke up.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So basically, Mayushii saved your life! Ehehe!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No. It was simply the choice of Steins Gate.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehh? Really?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Really.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh...”[%p]
Mayuri looks a little disappointed.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey. Remember what you said when your fever went down?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You said everything went blurry and twisty like, and the ground shook so bad you couldn’t stand. Remember?’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You were acting kind of like that just now.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Are you okay? You’re not coming down with a fever, are you?”[%p]
The concern on her face is so sincere.[%p]
Looks like she’s worried about my reaction to Moeka’s disappearance.[%p]
Geez. My “hostage” is worrying about me.[%p]
I find myself giving her a wry smile.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m fine. Don’t worry about a thing.”[%p]
As I brush her worry off with a shrug, I think back to what happened ten years ago.[%p]
When I woke up from that fever, the first thing I saw was Mayuri’s crying face.[%p]
She’s right. I vaguely remember describing my collapse that way.[%p]
And come to think of it, it does seem to match with the sensation I felt a few hours ago when Reading Steiner activated.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see! So this power was already mine back then! Muhahaha!”[%p]
So that’s the choice of Steins Gate![%p]
I really was born with this power![%p]
No wonder John Titor thinks I’m the Messiah![%p]
My maniacal laughter echoes into the night.[%p]
