The next day, the lab gets an unusual guest.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Pardon the intrusion...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, if it isn’t Luka-shi.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Hello, Hashida-san, Okabe-san.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako! You don’t have Demon Sword Samidare with you! What is the meaning of this!?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh, eh, eh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]”I even unsealed the treasured heirloom sword [color index="820000"]Mistilteinn[color index="800000"] when I heard you were coming today. I’m disappointed in you.” [%p]
Actually, I didn’t know he was coming.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m sorry! Um, I’ll go back and get it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, that’s okay. It was not Mistilteinn’s fate to encounter Samidare this day.”[%p]
I look out the window with an expression of melancholy.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But a Japanese sword and a cursed sword from Norse mythology are so mismatched it’s not even funny. Do we even have a sword here?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“What should I...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako, though you are my disciple, you still lack dedication.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I-I’m sorry!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“At this rate, it will take some time before you can be useful.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By the way, why not join our lab?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh, me?”[%p]
Lukako looks at me blankly.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“But I’m clumsy, and I’m not good at science or engineering... I’ll probably just get in your way...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Do you really want me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t sweat it. Mayuri’s the same.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“We’d love to have you, Luka-kun!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But you know, if Luka-kun’s gonna be a lab mem, then Mayushii has one condition for Okarin. Don’t tease Luka-kun.”[%p]
Mayuri forces her way between us as if to protect Lukako.[%p]
She’s the one who called Lukako here.[%p]
They’re classmates.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And today, Luka-kun is Mayushii’s guest. He came for a fitting session, so don’t get in our way.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“But Mayuri-chan, I don’t really want to cosplay... Um, can it really just be a fitting session?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup. We’re just making sure the size matches!”[%p]
Looks like Mayuri forced him to come. As far as she’s concerned, pretty boys exist only to make her cosplay fantasies come true.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tadah♪”[%p]
Mayuri shows off the costume she made.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“This is a costume of Kirari-chan from RaiNet!”[%p]
Is it just my imagination, or is that outfit pretty skimpy?[%p]
I don’t know if it’s his first time seeing it, but Lukako just stares at the costume dumbfounded.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Anyway, I’d say it’s about 70% complete, but I want Luka-kun to try it on now♪”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Try it on? Here?”[%p]
Lukako glances at me and Daru, then looks down to hide a blush.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I can’t...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Please?”[%p]
Hmm... here’s where I, as Lukako’s master, ought to help out.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Listen, my pupil. To change your clothes is to change your very being. This costume might help you grow stronger. Put it on at once!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“You’re on her side? I just... can’t wear something so embarrassing!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s only embarrassing because [color index="A0140000"]you[color index="800000"] think it is.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s right! I’m sure you’ll be really cute♪”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Besides, Mayuri worked very hard to make this costume so you could wear it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She sacrificed her sleeping time, her favorite banana nourishment time, and her Juicy Chicken Number One time just so she could sew and sew and sew.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can’t let effort like that go to waste.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“That’s true, but...”[%p]
The good-natured Lukako is already bending to the power of my words.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Come on, Luka-kun! Transform! Tra-ns-form♪”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh, wait a sec, wahhhhhhh!”[%p]
Mayuri grabs Lukako’s arm and drags him to the changing room.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay! Don’t be shy! Now take off your clothes.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Wahh! Mayuri-chan, please don’t touch me there! I’ll change by myself! Please wait outside!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But it’s a little tricky putting this on. Mayushii will teach you all the steps♪”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Hyeeehhh, please don’t undress me!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s so... [color index="820000"]yuri[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s not yuri. Lukako’s a guy.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Then it’s reverse rape!? Whoa, that’s downright criminal!”[%p]
His imagination knows no bounds.[%p]
A few minutes pass and out comes Mayuri first.[%p]
She looks satisfied.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Come on, Luka-kun! Don’t be shy.”[%p]
Lukako doesn’t make an appearance, even when Mayuri calls him.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Luka-kun?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
Finally, a nervous Lukako comes out of the dressing room.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
Lukako looks like he’s about to cry. I can already see the tears forming.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I-isn’t that skirt a little too short?[%p]
Those bare legs are truly captivati... wait, oh god, oh god![%p]
I’m looking at a guy’s legs! What the hell am I saying!?[%p]
Why are his legs shaved!? What’s going on here, Lukako!?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Waaahh! Luka-kun finally wore one of my outfits!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I-it’s so embarrassing... I’m a guy... I shouldn’t be dressing like this...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You know what they say. Cuteness is Justice♪”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I don’t know what you mean!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Excellent work as usual. The clothes and the model bring out the best in each other.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“As far as 3D goes, Faris-tan is supreme, but Luka-shi almost makes me wanna become a [color index="820000"]low angler[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What about you, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah, yeah, well...”[%p]
When urged to talk, I nod vaguely.[%p]
I’m fascinated... but it’s mortifying to admit that.[%p]
Lukako is Lukako, yet Lukako is a man. Male.[%p]
A man just shouldn’t be fascinated by another man.[%p]
I whip out my phone and put it to my ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me! My sanity is under attack! No, it’s not the Organization. It’s a descendent... of one of the town’s... guardian miko! Guh! It’s... infecting my soul!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“To think... Akiba had... such a powerful guardian! If we can harness this power... we can counteract the Organization’s corrupting influence.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I know. We can’t hand the town over to those bastards just yet. This, too, is the choice of Steins Gate... El Psy Kongroo!”[%p]
I catch my breath, put away my phone, and turn back and smile at Lukako and the others who are staring blankly at me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whew... Lukako. Foolish disciple of mine. From now on, you shall go into battle equipped with that costume and Samidare.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehh? Kirari-chan doesn’t have a sword! He should carry an Upa instead♪”[%p]
Mayuri, in high spirits, makes Lukako hold the Upa cushion.[%p]
His lips tremble as he reluctantly accepts the cushion. He clearly doesn’t know what to do with it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The Organization is making a move on Akiba.”[%p]
I pretend not to notice Lukako’s distress.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You are the guardian who protects this chaotic metropolis. Miko of Yanabayashi Shrine, now is the time for you to fulfill that duty!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Understand, Lukako? This is the reason I’m so hard on you. You have a duty to protect this town!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Do I... really?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You certainly do! Muhahaha!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Can you stop that vulgar laughter? I can hear you from outside. It’s embarrassing.”[%p]
Kurisu enters the lab with those remarks.[%p]
She’s coming in late, like she’s a company executive or something.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Chris-chan, tutturu♪”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mmgh!? You come here this late and dare insult me? And you call yourself my assistant!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m not your assistant. Don’t make me repeat myself.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway! You’re the worst, toying with such a weak and innocent girl. Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Toying with a weak and innocent girl, you say?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t react to every little thing, you perv.”[%p]
That’s right. Christina doesn’t know Lukako’s a guy.[%p]
Correcting it is a pain, so I don’t say anything.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“At any rate...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina. Stop eying Lukako’s entire body from top to bottom like that.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I-I wasn’t doing that!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Do you like the costume, Chris-chan? It really suits Luka-kun, dontcha think?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Is this that cosplay thing I’ve heard about? It’s part of Japanimation culture, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re very cute.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“C-c-cute? No way...”[%p]
Lukako’s eyes get wetter and wetter.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why are you crying? You look perfect, so you should be more confident.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Uuugh...”[%p]
Kurisu doesn’t know, so she’s not doing it intentionally, but I guess that makes things complicated for Lukako.[%p]
I should change the topic for Lukako’s sake. While I am a mad scientist, I also happen to be a perfect gentleman![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh...”[%p]
I comb back my hair with my fingers.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako! Tell us your wish.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh...?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s one hell of an acrobatic topic change.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Listen, Lukako! Your desires can become reality. Japan is a land of great spiritual power. It resides in every word that slips from your tongue!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now that you too have joined the otaku world, you need conceal your deepest desires no longer!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Speak your wish with a true heart, and by the chaos that rules Akihabara, Steins Gate shall grant it!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“My... wish?”[%p]
Lukako puts his hands together in front of his waist and bends his head slightly to the side. His cheeks turn light pink.[%p]
His bashful, squirming appearance with wet, upturned eyes would make anyone who saw him either want to hug him real tight, or smack him upside the head. It’s that damn powerful.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Well...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“If I tell you... promise not to laugh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Just proclaim it to the world!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well yeah, no wish is embarrassing compared to the idiotic wish for chaos to envelop the world or whatever.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You, assistant! What kind of person laughs at people’s wishes!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Mayushii’s wish is to eat a ton of of yummy food, and to cover the lab with Upa goods, and to get Luka-kun to wear my costumes--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not asking you.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But Mayushii wants ’[color index="820000"]Shota[color index="800000"] in the Gate’ to grant her wish too!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“’Shota in the Gate’!? That mistake is god tier. Probably because it’s so... naughty.”[%p]
We all ignore Daru.[%p]
Lukako puts his hands to his mouth and casts his eyes down.[%p]
The same gesture as a (female) junior confessing her love to a (male) senior underneath a cherry tree.[%p]
Cuteness overload! Must resist![%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I want... to be a girl.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...What?”[%p]
Kurisu is the first to react. Her expression is one of utter confusion.[%p]
Well, that’s only natural.[%p]
Not even I expected that, so I accidentally swallowed my “muhahaha.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I don’t really... like how I look...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I always thought... that if I were a girl... I could be a little more confident...”[%p]
So he has no confidence in himself.[%p]
He’s prettier than any girl here.[%p]
And yet, he has no confidence.[%p]
I’m well aware of the reason for this.[%p]
It’s because he’s a guy![%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wait. Wait a second.”[%p]
Kurisu starts rubbing her temples.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Umm, what did she say?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh, heh, heh. Assistant mine -- no, Christina!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m not your assistant, and I’m not Christina!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’ve made a grave error!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I have?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t you understand? No, of course you don’t. How could you, with impure thoughts clouding your eyes!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wh-what do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Allow me to explain. You called Lukako here a ’weak and innocent girl.’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But he’s not a girl at all. He’s a guy!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Is that some kind of joke?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not a joke, but the naked truth as described in the [color index="820000"]Akashic Records[color index="800000"]! Muhahaha!”[%p]
Kurisu looks at Daru and Mayuri as if seeking help, but they nod with a knowing look in their eyes.[%p]
As for Lukako himself, he’s just hanging his head in shame.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Are you guys trolling me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Eh?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Eh?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Eh?”[%p]
Kurisu suddenly turns away as if to avoid my gaze. Then she walks up to Lukako.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Is what Okabe says true?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Y-yes...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m... a guy...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“N-no way! Someone this cute can’t be a boy!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’ve got it backwards. You’re supposed to say ’Someone this cute can’t be a girl.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s not what I meant.”[%p]
Does that mean Kurisu knows the meaning of the phrase “Someone this cute can’t be a girl”?[%p]
So she [color index="A0140000"]is[color index="800000"] an @channeler...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako. You’re fine just the way you are. I will not reject you, be you man or be you woman. Nor will anyone else here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And I will not deny your wish. Nor will anyone else here.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Why do you keep repeating that last part?”[%p]
Kurisu, unable to calm down after learning the truth, starts touching her own face and checking her hair in her pocket mirror.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why, Christina. Is it such a shock to meet a man far more feminine than you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I admit it. Compared to her... I mean, to him, I’m not as cute, I talk more rudely, and my attitude is worse...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This is a three-day-coma level shock.”[%p]
Looks like she’s seriously depressed.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Chris-chan’s cute too♪”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t try to comfort me. It just makes me feel worse.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Admitting your faults is the first step towards becoming stronger. You may one day become a splendid woman, Christina. You’re still young.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Who the hell asked you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I take it back! You’re a stubborn fool who refuses to face the truth!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Shut up. I don’t want to hear that from you.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... sorry. I shouldn’t have said anything.”[%p]
Lukako bows his head for some reason.[%p]
His eyes are red and puffy.[%p]
With such a cute girl -- err, boy -- on the verge of tears, Kurisu and I have no choice but to stop arguing.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Welp, better get my trusty digicam...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t try to sneak in a photo session, you perv!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Anzai-sensei, I want to be a low angler...”[%p]
But still, it was just a whim to ask for Lukako’s wish. I hardly expected this to happen.[%p]
So that’s how Lukako thinks of himself...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako, how serious are you about that wish of yours?”[%p]
If he’s truly desperate, then having a sex-change operation is probably the best way to go.[%p]
Judging by his current looks, Lukako could become the star of Tokyo’s LGBT community.[%p]
No, screw that, he could even become a TV personality.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“You know those stories where a guy magically turns into a girl overnight? Sometimes I wish that would happen to me.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ahaha... that’s stupid, isn’t it?”[%p]
Stop it with those puppy dog eyes![%p]
Are you that chihuahua from a certain popular commercial!?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Luka-kun, you’re so cute♪”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“S-So cute...”[%p]
Looks like Kurisu’s been struck by Lukako’s cuteness too.[%p]
The skimpy costume he’s wearing isn’t helping![%p]
It’s like dunking your brain in a vat of pure moe. Then you die.[%p]
The scary part is that afterwards, you feel an irresistible urge to grant Lukako’s every wish.[%p]
But as Lukako said, it’s going to be hard to find a nice, clean solution to his problem.[%p]
And then, Kurisu clears her throat.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This reminds me of something I heard once.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Exposition scene, go!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There’s a saying that if you eat a lot of meat when you’re pregnant, you’ll have a boy, and if you eat a lot of vegetables, you’ll have a girl.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Source? [color index="820000"]Minmei Shobou[color index="800000"]?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I saw it on the internet.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“S-so that’s how you reply... well played.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wh-what are you talking about?”[%p]
Anyway, it sounds like an old wives’ tale.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really? I didn’t know that. So Mayushii and Chris-chan’s moms ate a lot of vegetables?”[%p]
Only Mayuri’s impressed.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii only eats Juicy Chicken Number One, so will her future child be a boy?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, do you think bananas count as vegetables?”[%p]
Mayuri is full of questions. I’ll leave her to them.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But what about primitive people who lived on hunting? If that theory is true, then they would have had too many boys and not enough girls.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Humanity would never have made it this far.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I never said it was true.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I just remembered hearing it somewhere. Don’t snap at every little thing.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I didn’t snap. Christina, feel like verifying that theory?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...What are you implying?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you forgotten? We have the PhoneWave (name subject to change)!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“PhoneWave-chan? It can tell if you’ll have a boy or a girl?”[%p]
No way in hell.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wait... of course.”[%p]
Looks like Kurisu’s got it.[%p]
They don’t call her a genius for nothing.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We can send a D-Mail to Urushibara-san’s mother when she was pregnant.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Indeed. Something like ’Eat more vegetables!’”[%p]
Lukako, who doesn’t know what D-Mails are, and Mayuri, who’s just a little dumb, tilt their heads in confusion at the same time.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You think it’s worth a shot?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s too late to hide behind your goody-two-shoes mask, Christina. Your fate is to become a mad scientist, for you are an experiment-loving girl!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Who are you calling an experiment-loving girl!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Am I wrong?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“N-no, but...”[%p]
That settles it![%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hold on, man! What are you going to do if the experiment works?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I mean, if Luka-shi’s sex seriously changes.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s what he wants, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, yeah, but...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“If his sex does change, won’t the 16 years of his life change too? That’s what I mean.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Who’s gonna take responsibility for that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... I’ll take responsibility...”[%p]
Lukako raises his hand timidly.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Seriously?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Well, I don’t really understand... but if we use this method, I might become a girl, right?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Then... I want to try.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Please, Master.”[%p]
He bows his head to me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, your opinion?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hmm... If Luka-kun becomes a girl, then I’ve gotta call her Luka-chan!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Will Luka-chan wear Mayushii’s costumes?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um, well, that’s another story...”[%p]
At any rate, it doesn’t look like Mayuri has any objections.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then that settles it. Lukako, I appoint you Lab Mem 006.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is our lab’s most important secret. In order to use it, you must become a lab mem.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ah! Okay!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Actually... I always wanted to be a lab member.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really? You should’ve just said so!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I didn’t have the courage... Like I said, I don’t know a thing about gadgets...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You don’t have to worry about those things. I mean, Mayuri doesn’t get them either.”[%p]
That’s not something to be proud of, Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So Lukako shall be a lab mem from this point forth. Any objections?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Here.”[%p]
Kurisu raises her hand.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I want to give Urushibara-san my number so I can retire.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Denied. Anyone else?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...*sigh*”[%p]
Mayuri and Daru ask “What happened to 005?” but I ignore them. Moeka will always be 005 in my heart.[%p]
No other objections emerge. All members are in favor.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Very well. Lukako is officially Lab Mem Number 006. Henceforth, pledge your allegiance to the lab, and devote all your strength to the enrichment of our science.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Y-yes! I will! I’m so happy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now then, let’s begin the experiment immedia--”[%p]
...Wait.[%p]
I suddenly realize something that makes me smack by forehead in dismay.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn! Lukako, you’re 16, right?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... right.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So you were born in 1993...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup! The same year as Mayushii. What about it?”[%p]
In order to tell Lukako’s mother to eat a lot of vegetables, we need to send a D-Mail to ten months before Lukako was born, meaning we have to send it to 1992.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When did cellphones become widespread in Japan!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ah...”[%p]
Looks like Kurisu and Daru figured it out.[%p]
Daru goes to google it.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Around 1996. There wasn’t mail until later, though.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So the year Lukako was born, most people still didn’t have cellphones.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako’s mother may not have had one. In that case, she might not be able to receive the D-Mail!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh! I get it!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh...? We can’t do it?”[%p]
Lukako’s face darkens. I fold my arms in thought.[%p]
Some way to receive the email... in an era when cellphones weren’t yet widespread...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What about modifying it to send crazy waves or something?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What the hell are crazy waves?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Waves that only crazy girls can pick up. You know, girls who always talk about stuff no one understands. It’s pretty moe.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ll microwave your brain if you don’t shut up.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yes! Abuse me more, please!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, couldn’t you put a letter in a time capsule and bury it?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That would go to the future, not the past.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I know! How about that thing where you get struck by lightning and that turns you into a girl! Like in old comics and anime.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There’s no point to the experiment if we don’t use D-Mail. Don’t lose sight of the objective.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“We’re counting on you for a nice idea, Chris-chan♪”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“M-me? I...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We could... build a rocket which exceeds the speed of light squared, then that immense speed would reverse the flow of time, or something...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’re forgetting about the PhoneWave too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Furthermore, genius girl, you just contradicted relativity.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It was just a joke. Don’t take it seriously.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Useless, all of you! This lab is a disgrace!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Fine then. Let’s hear from Hououin Kyouma, the insane mad scientist with an IQ over 170 whose brain cells are coveted the world over. What’s your genius plan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm... Inspiration flashes in the corners of my brain.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That Edison thing again?”[%p]
This sensation... yes! My natural mad scientist inspiration is about to explode![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I have it.”[%p]
All eyes focus on me.[%p]
With a broad grin, I proclaim--[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If we can’t send it to a cellphone, then we’ll send it... to a [color index="820000"]pager[color index="800000"]!”[%p]
