About 22 hours have passed since I made my mind-blowingly awesome proclamation.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“H-hello...”[%p]
Luka enters the lab shyly, just as he did yesterday.[%p]
He gives me a bashful smile when our eyes meet.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Mom had a pager.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yay! That’s great, Luka-kun!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Now we can proceed with the experiment.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Luka-shi’s girl version... will definitely be moe.”[%p]
Mayuri, Kurisu, and Daru are already on standby.[%p]
Sending a D-Mail to a pager.[%p]
Yesterday, we argued about whether it’s even possible. Eventually, we settled on ’probably.’[%p]
Data is data, after all.[%p]
The rest depends on the pager radio wave stations 8 years ago, but it should be fine as long as our data gets through safely.[%p]
We already googled how to send data to a pager.[%p]
For the pagers back then, you would first enter the other person’s pager number, then, if in the Kanto region, enter “*2*2”.[%p]
After that, you would enter the numbers to send. That’s how it worked, apparently.[%p]
Pagers in 1992 could still only send numbers. Phone number display functions were also yet to be implemented, so your number was hidden from the other person by default.[%p]
A few years after that, pagers started to implement Japanese character displays, enabling functionality similar to that of email.[%p]
Therefore, the D-Mail Lukako’s about to send -- it’s technically not a mail, though -- has to be sent in numerical form.[%p]
Naturally, I have a conversion table for that on hand.[%p]
You can find information even from 18 years ago if you just google it.[%p]
I was pretty worried by the lack of information on pagers at first, but that’s my little secret.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Urushibara-san, you need to think about what to send to your mother in the past.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh...? I do?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you want to grant your wish, then you must open the door with your own hands. We can only show you the way.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I understand...”[%p]
We explain to Lukako the function of the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
The numbers we’re sending are one-byte characters, so we can send 36 of them.[%p]
The pager’s number-to-letter conversion system uses two numbers to correspond to one Japanese character.[%p]
Furthermore, since you first need to input “*2*2”, that means you can only send 16 hiragana characters.[%p]
Lukako, understanding everything, takes out a notebook to begin writing drafts for the pager message.[%p]
I show Lukako the site I found.[%p]
It reads PAGER NUMBER AND LETTER CONVERSION.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Umm...”[%p]
Pager typing is commonly known as “two-touch typing” or “pager input.”[%p]
It’s somewhat different from cellphone input. You choose the consonant and then input the vowel.[%p]
The consonants are “A K S T N H M Y R W”.[%p]
The vowels are “a, i, u, e, o”.[%p]
Basically, to input “Ke”...[%p]
You press “2” to input the consonant “K”...[%p]
Then you press “4” for the vowel “e”.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“This is a pain. Let’s just send ’831831831’. That should do it.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Why 831?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“8(ya) 3(sa) 1(i) for veggies ([color index="A0140000"]yasai[color index="800000"]), duh. VEGGIES VEGGIES VEGGIES -- we just have to drill this into Luka-shi’s mother’s brain.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She’ll just pass that message off as a prank.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Then, how about ’29292929’?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m going to regret asking this, but what does that mean?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ni(2) ku(9) for meat. MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why do you want her to like meat!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s not it! If you keep repeating ’MEAT’, then she’ll actually start to hate meat and want to eat vegetables instead, don’t you think?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah... no.”[%p]
Lukako completes his composition while we speak our nonsense.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“How about something like this?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“’MOM EAT VEGGIES OK’”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Isn’t that a little too vague?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And the first ’MOM’ should go. That’ll just make it harder to believe.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Then... ’EAT LOTS OF VEGGIES TO GIVE BIRTH TO A GIRL’.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s a little too direct. And it’s over the character limit.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“’EAT VEGGIES FOR HEALTHY KID’”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait a sec. According to this conversion chart, it looks like you gotta use two more numbers for voiced consonants.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So that sentence is four bytes over.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then a little modification. How about ’EAT VEG 4 HEALTHY KID’?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Isn’t that a little too informal? You’re talking to Urushibara-san’s mother, you know? Would she understand the ’VEG 4’ part?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You have any bright ideas?”[%p]
Kurisu shrugs her shoulders and says no more.[%p]
Then it’s settled.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Come on, let’s type it out!”[%p]
When sending to a pager, the number-encoded message is handled like a telephone number, so we enter the input into the X68000.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]“*2*281311223134524040322512502137493”[%e]
The long, random-looking string of numbers is complete.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alright, we’re good to go.”[%p]
Now we just activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and have Lukako call.[%p]
The microwave timer is set to 154152 seconds. It should arrive around January 1, 1993. The margin of error is around 1-3 days, I guess. Leap year calculation’s a pain, so I ignored it.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
Lukako’s slender finger starts to tremble on top of the enter button.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ready? I’m starting it up.”[%p]
Lukako looks at me with tears in his eyes, then nods faintly.[%p]
The discharge phenomenon soon occurs.[%p]
Lukako flinches and takes a step back, but then I see determination flare in his eyes.[%p]
He sets his jaw... and pushes the enter button.[%p]
A wave of dizziness hits me again.[%p]
I place a hand on the table to support myself.[%p]
The dizziness slowly fades.[%p]
Little by little, color returns to the world.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nn...”[%p]
Reading Steiner activated again.[%p]
Did the worldline change?[%p]
I look around the room.[%p]
Unlike what happened with Moeka, Lukako’s still here.[%p]
He blushes when he notices my stare.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um, Okabe-san, could you... please not look at me like that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I fold my arms and tilt my head.[%p]
Lukako’s appearance hasn’t changed a bit.[%p]
I’m paying particular attention[evaluate expr="280AA3E814210000"] to his chest.[evaluate expr="280AA3E814210000"] And his chest.[evaluate expr="280AA3E814210000"] And his chest.[%p]
As a guy, it’s natural for him to have no breasts.[%p]
But if he’s a girl now, then that’s a different story.[%p]
That washboard isn’t tiny-breast level. It’s no-breast level.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It... didn’t work?”[%p]
So the “eat lots of vegetables to give birth to a girl” thing Kurisu talked about was nothing but fringe science.[%p]
What kind of scientist believes such a flimsy theory anyway?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What didn’t work?”[%p]
Everyone, including Lukako, looks at me in confusion.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t you remember? Just now, we used the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to--”[%p]
I slap a hand over my mouth as soon as I start talking.[%p]
That was careless of me.[%p]
As our previous experiments proved, the activation of Reading Steiner means that the worldline has changed.[%p]
And I’m the only one who carries his memories through the change.[%p]
Nobody else here knows what we did.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry. It’s nothing.”[%p]
Afterwards, Mayuri and Lukako happily go out shopping for lunch at a neighborhood convenience store.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina. I want to ask you something. Is Lukako...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What pervy act are you thinking about this time? Can’t be too careful around the perv duo.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We’re not a perv duo. We are a pervy gentlemen duo!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Whatever. Seriously, whatever.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Muh...”[%p]
Damn. I can’t ask now. It’s really annoying that no one remembers.[%p]
I don’t want to think about how Kurisu might react if I suddenly ask “Is Lukako a girl?”[%p]
I should wait until I can get Lukako alone, and check then.[%p]
But considering how his appearance hasn’t changed at all, it’s very likely that the sex change failed.[%p]
In that case, what [color index="A0140000"]did[color index="800000"] Lukako’s D-Mail change?[%p]
It’s just like the Moeka experiment. The result is different from what we expected.[%p]
The real problem... is that we have no control.[%p]
