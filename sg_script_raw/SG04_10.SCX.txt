After I leave the lab, I head to MayQueen+Nyan² to think.[%p]
Daru sits in front of me, waiting impatiently for Faris to bring our order.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru. What do you think about D-Mail?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s cool, but it’s kinda lame at the same time.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s lame about it?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I couldn’t use it to win my RaiNet match against Faris-tan.”[%p]
Now that’s a selfish reason...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“As our experiments have shown, D-Mail still hasn’t reached a reliable level of precision.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A true time machine must remove luck from the equation. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is useless unless we can somehow give the sender more control.”[%p]
For starters, there’s the problem of how I’m the only one who can recognize the changes.[%p]
Without my special power, we wouldn’t even be able to check the results of the experiment. Ridiculous.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah, we aren’t getting results. What about the LOTO SIX?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Pending.”[%p]
Although it was Lukako’s mistake that cost us the prize, he wouldn’t have been in a position to make that mistake if I hadn’t asked him to buy the ticket in my stead.[%p]
Why did I do that? It’s as if Steins Gate guided the money away from my grasp.[%p]
No. I need to think positive.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hououin Kyouma will not let this keep him down. I won’t give up. For I am a mad scientist!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I don’t understand what you’re saying, but you sure seem confident about it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Someday we will improve the PhoneWave (name subject to change) so that it may be used to send things not only to the past, but also to the future. We’ll improve it. No, we must improve it!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“For that is the choice of Steins Gate! Muhahahaha!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“A time machine!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“!!?”[%p]
Faris is standing right next to me. Where the hell did she come from?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn you, Faris! Eavesdropping is cowardly!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“What do you mean? Your voice is so loud, it echoes through the whole store nya.”[%p]
Wha... no![%p]
Once again, I leaked classified information concerning the future of mankind![%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Here’s your iced coffee, and your iced tea and ’cat food’. Thanks for waiting, nyan♪”[%p]
Daru’s order of “cat food” is one of this maid cafe’s specialties.[%p]
It’s not the usual miso over rice, but a stylish risotto instead.[%p]
It’s one of Daru’s favorites. It’s actually pretty tasty.[%p]
Faris places the ice coffee in front of me.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Do you want milk and syrup nyan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“NEVER.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If Kyouma’s gonna be like that, I’ll pour it all in nya! You need sugar for a healthy brain, nyan♪”[%p]
Despite my refusal, Faris pours all of the milk and syrup into my glass.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyan nyan, nyan nyan♪”[%p]
Then, speaking some nonsense incantation, she mixes my iced coffee with the straw. And the whole time, she stares straight into my eyes.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“There it is! Faris-tan’s secret technique, ’Eye Contact Mix-Mix’!”[%p]
Daru starts explaining in excitement.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Most maids can’t do it without spilling a little, yet Faris-tan makes it look easy! That’s why I love her!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s because of this secret technique that Faris-tan reigns supreme as MayQueen’s number one maid!”[%p]
The iced coffee in the glass changes from black to brown.[%p]
Damn! She’s dragging me into her pace again.[%p]
Next, Faris performs the same secret technique on Daru.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Thank you, Faris-tan! I’ll be sure to savor it.”[%p]
He bows deeply. Such a polite man.[%p]
I take a sip of my iced coffee. Its bitterness and sweetness flow down my throat.[%p]
When I look up, I see Faris standing next to me, her silver tray in front of her waist.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you need something?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I wanna hear the rest, nya♪”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma and Daru-nyan were having a fun little chit-cat, nya? Something about a time machine.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris really wants to hear, nyan!”[%p]
She gives me a babyish look with upturned eyes.[%p]
But I firmly reject her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s top secret. Not for outsiders!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“And whose big mouth let the whole store hear, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Tell Faris, Daru-nyan...”[%p]
She’s targeting Daru now.[%p]
Don’t underestimate him, Faris NyanNyan.[%p]
Daru is my most trustworthy right hand man, the wizard-class super hacka.[%p]
He won’t be tricked into divulging classified information![%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We’ve built an amazing machine that can send emails to the past. I did most of the work, of course.”[%p]
And he’s broken![%p]
Women are scary...[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Is that a time machine, nya!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I guess you could say that!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Wow! You’re awesome, nya! Your big brain makes my heart race, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You mean it? N-now I’m embarrassed, hehehe.”[%p]
Dumbass. What’s with that grin?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris dreams of going on a journey through time nya.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ll bring you along some day.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, don’t make promises you can’t keep.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“By the way, it’s been bugging me, but what [color index="A0140000"]is[color index="800000"] time anyway, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Time is often compared to a river, nya, flowing from past to future.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But is that really how it is, nya?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If time is a river, then where is the present, nya? Is it a point? Is it a line? Where does the present begin and end, nya?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Now that you mention it, I only have a vague concept of time. Never gave it any serious thought.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The present is a leaf floating on the river. It moves along with the flow from past to future.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So are we riding on that leaf, nya? When you die, do you fall off, nyan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You could say that. All points upstream from the leaf are the past. Downstream, the future.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hmnya...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But is that leaf only the present for humans, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Meaning...?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Humans make units to define and observe time, which is how we know this leaf is the present.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But if every living thing in the universe went extinct, nothing would exist to observe the present, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“In that case, where would the present go, nya?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wouldn’t something like God or the will of the universe observe it?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But what if God is a [color index="820000"]four-dimensional[color index="800000"] being who can freely move through time, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“U-uh...?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If God is the one who decides the present, then won’t our present move with him, nya?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“This is hard...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So what you’re saying is that the present is subjective to the observer.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If we go with that assumption, then the past and the future also depend on the observer, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If Faris were to use a time machine to travel back one week, then Kyouma and Daru-nyan’s present would become Faris’s future, nya.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I guess that makes sense...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So how does the leaf model reflect that difference, nya?”[%p]
Neither Daru nor I has an answer to that.[%p]
Perhaps nobody has an answer. Just like the ’collapse of causality’ thing that Kurisu mentioned.[%p]
Does that mean that time machines and time travel are impossible after all?[%p]
But SERN’s gelified test subjects physically traveled as far back as 1921...[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Anyway, if everything depends on the observer, then clocks are meaningless, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Fun times fly, and hard times drag, nya. In other words, the flow of time changes depending on your point of view, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Speaking of which, as you grow older, it feels like time starts to flow faster, doesn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“[color index="820000"]Janet’s law[color index="800000"]...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris thinks about this stuff sometimes, nya. I think time might not be something as simple as a river, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah, the more you think about it, the more complicated it gets.”[%p]
The strict definition of time, similar to the question of “Where is the self?”, is one of humanity’s eternal questions. Countless renowned scholars have left this question unanswered.[%p]
There’s no way amateurs like us can answer it.[%p]
But there’s one thing I [color index="A0140000"]can[color index="800000"] do.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh. Heh heh heh. Muhahaha!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyanya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Fret not. Though physics and philosophy may deny us, our machine [color index="A0140000"]has[color index="800000"] made time travel possible! Am I correct, Daru!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah. Yeah! That’s right!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyaa... looks like you guys have kicked reason to the curb, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But Faris wants to use the time machine too, nya. Can I, please?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Sure! I’ll let you use it as much as you want, Faris-tan.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Really nya? Then it’s a promise, nya!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, don’t decide things on your own!”[%p]
Faris springs up with joy and hugs Daru’s rotund body.[%p]
That’s all it takes to make Daru look like he’s died and gone to heaven.[%p]
