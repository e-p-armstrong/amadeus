After killing some more time at MayQueen, I leave Daru and head back to the lab.[%p]
When I arrive, I find Kurisu sitting on the bench in front of the Braun Tube Workshop, talking on her phone. [%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What? You called me all the way to Japan, and now you--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I knew it. You never wanted to see me, did you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...sniff.”[%p]
The street is dark and her hair is covering her eyes, so I can’t make out her expression.[%p]
But from the sound of her voice, I can tell that she’s crying.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why did you ask me to come here, then? Can you at least tell me tha--”[%p]
Kurisu lifts her head in surprise. She must have noticed me.[%p]
She falls into an awkward silence, then turns and walks away.[%p]
It looked like she was crying. I wonder if she got into a fight.[%p]
Who could have made her cry like that?[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]Her boyfriend!?[%e]
Even a friendless, experiment-loving girl like her can get a boyfriend...[%p]
No! There’s no way such an arrogant, abusive girl can have a boyfriend![%p]
But, then who was it?[%p]
A sibling? Or maybe her father who she hasn’t seen in seven years?[%p]
I’m afraid to ask. Kurisu’s scary when she snaps.[%p]
The memory of her baleful glare sends a shiver up my spine. I hurry to the second floor.[%p]
When I’m safe in the lab, I start browsing @channel.[%p]
It doesn’t look like Titor has made an appearance today.[%p]
The Titor craze that has dominated the occult board for the past week is starting to die down.[%p]
In the end, it looks like I’m the only one who took Titor seriously. Just about everyone is skeptical of him now, especially the poster called “KuriGohan and Kamehameha”.[%p]
Honestly, I can’t tell Titor’s true intentions either.[%p]
Suddenly, I hear the door swing open. Startled, I turn to face the sound.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu is standing there glaring at me.[%p]
Her eyes are red.[%p]
So she was crying.[%p]
Why did she come back?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I... I...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-yeah?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I wasn’t crying or anything, okay!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, you were definitely crying.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t be ridiculous! Where’s your proof!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your eyes are red.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ugh...”[%p]
Her glare weakens for a second, but then returns at double the intensity.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I wasn’t crying, okay!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re not being very logical, Christina.”[%p]
In fact, she’s not acting like herself at all.[%p]
Did she come up here just to claim that she wasn’t crying?[%p]
She should have just gone back to her hotel and cried into a pillow instead of coming here to make excuses.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, I wasn’t crying. Understand? End of discussion. Sniff.”[%p]
That sniffle tanked any credibility she might have had.[%p]
Even now, instead of going back to her hotel, she plops onto the sofa and hugs Mayuri’s Upa plushie to her chest like a little girl.[%p]
For the next few minutes, she just sits there, pouting and staring at the wall.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
If the TV were on, then we could have a little BGM for some distraction, but unfortunately, painful silence prevails.[%p]
The only sounds are the whirring of the desktop’s hard drive and Kurisu’s occasional sniffle.[%p]
Geez, what an annoying assistant.[%p]
How are we supposed to get any science done like this?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Shut up. Don’t talk to me.”[%p]
Your lips say “don’t,” but your aura says “please.”[%p]
Maybe she’s begging for attention?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Listen. You don’t have to talk. Just listen.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If there’s something troubling you, I’ll do everything in my power to help.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Eh?”[%p]
Kurisu looks at me blankly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And it’s not just me. I’m sure I speak for Mayuri and Daru as well.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So don’t hesitate to come to us.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When you want to cry, don’t hold it in. Just let it out. We won’t reject you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’ll hear you out.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Because you’re important to us. You’re our friend.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ah... yeah...”[%p]
For some reason, Kurisu blushes and hangs her head.[%p]
She hugs Upa so hard, his face caves in.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I’m sorry. I was a little upset.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. Just tell me when you’re ready. I’ll hear you out.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Okay.”[%p]
She nods softly.[%p]
Looks like my sincerity has reached her.[%p]
Heh... heh heh... heh heh heh![%p]
[margin top="228"][center]Just as planned![%e]
Show a friendless, experiment-loving girl just a little kindness, and she’ll easily grant you her favor.[%p]
How do I know that? Because I, too, have few friends! Muhahaha![%p]
Kurisu’s help is critical to solving the mystery of the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
Now that my plan has succeeded, her petty private matters shall no longer be an impediment to our science.[%p]
Normally I, the great Hououin Kyouma, would not concern myself with the mental health of my minions, but if this is the price I must pay to bring my dream to fruition, so be it![%p]
With this, Kurisu’s loyalty is assured. Soon, the world will tremble before us![%p]
