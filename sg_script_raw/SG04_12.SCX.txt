After killing some time at MayQueen, I leave Daru and head back to the lab.[%p]
The only person there is Mayuri. She’s working on a costume.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh. Mayuri, you’re like a housewife burning the midnight oil to bring a little more money home.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Eh? Midnight oil? Are we eating?”[%p]
Sigh, kids these days.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Besides, Mayushii doesn’t charge for her costumes.”[%p]
Seems like she understood the rest of what I said.[%p]
It was just a joke, anyway.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hobbies should just be hobbies, you know. It makes me happy to see someone wearing a costume I made♪”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you want to become a designer?”[%p]
Come to think of it, Mayuri has never talked about her future.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“No way. It’s too hard!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then what is your dream? Mine is to destroy the System and plunge the world into chaos.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um... Mayushii just wants to keep hanging out in the lab.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? You want to be a lab mem forever? I appreciate your enthusiasm, but this lab has no interest in profit. You’ll always be hurting for food.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You know, Okarin, we have six lab mems now. Isnt it amazing? Mayushii never expected we’d grow this big.”[%p]
That’s a sudden change in topic.[%p]
And for some reason, she’s puffing her chest out in pride.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s all because Mayushii became your hostage!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No. That has nothing to do with it. I tricked every last one of you into joining with my masterful manipulations! Muhahaha!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You shouldn’t say things like that. And besides, you didn’t trick me!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s true. You came of your own volition.”[%p]
She joined the lab without my ever asking. When she appeared in the doorway and offered to join, I thought she was a goddess sent from heaven. [%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Can Mayushii still be your hostage?”[%p]
Is that a joke or a serious question? I can’t tell.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is that what you want?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Well...”[%p]
Mayuri drops the costume in her hand.[%p]
And then she smiles shyly.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Maybe it is!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Such a masochist! I had no idea!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“???”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But I mean, as long as I’m your hostage, Mayushii won’t be lonely, and neither will Okarin. Ehehe!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I... I see.”[%p]
Sometimes Mayuri throws me off my game.[%p]
But if that’s her reason for staying at the lab, then I’m happy.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ah! I’d better get going.”[%p]
Mayuri stands up and starts putting away her various sewing tools.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hm?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Want to get something to eat on the way back? My treat.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really? You never treat me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh, I’m in a good mood today!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Then how about Kitchen Jiro?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Their minced cutlet is, um, god tier.”[%p]
She’ll get no argument from me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just leave it to me.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yay! I love you, Okarin♪ Mayushii’s really happy!”[%p]
Well, at least she’s easy to please.[%p]
Mayuri and I head for Kitchen Jiro. After that, I’ll see her safely to the station. [%p]
