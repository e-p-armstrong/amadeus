I spend the next morning doing laundry at the nearby laundromat. When I return to the lab just past noon, Daru, Mayuri, and Kurisu are all assembled.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thanks for coming in on a Saturday. Your devotion to science makes me proud.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
Kurisu sighs deeply.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s the middle of summer, but instead of going on vacation, I’m stuck in this sauna with a bunch of pervs.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Where did I go wrong?”[%p]
She’s really giving us a verbal beatdown.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wipe your tears, you experiment-loving girl without a single friend.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m not crying!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Besides, you’re the one who told us to be here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Indeed. But the one who obeyed my orders and arrived on time... was you.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You know, Chris-chan is actually a very honest and hardworking girl. That’s what Mayushii thinks♪”[%p]
Mayuri smiles as she eats some nuggets from [color index="820000"]McD’s[color index="800000"].[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s what makes her so adorable.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh, wha...!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“How can this girl say something like that while eating a nugget...”[%p]
Don’t let it bother you. That’s just Mayuri’s nature.[%p]
I’ve been with her for a long time, so I’m used to it.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“A yuri [color index="820000"]flag[color index="800000"]. I get it.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Please unget it.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Here, Chris-chan. Have a nugget.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Th-thanks...”[%p]
While listening to their heartwarming banter, I go to put my laundry on the table. However--[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t put that there. It’s filthy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I just washed them!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Like I care. What kind of guy puts his underwear in a girl’s face? Have some decency.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you’re that interested in my underwear, then just say so.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wh-wha...!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m not interested at all!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Come on, guys. No more talking about underwear. Mayushii’s trying to eat here, okay?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“How can you say that when you’re still shoveling nuggets into your mouth...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t interrupt me!”[%p]
I end up putting my laundry in the changing room.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“As I explained to Daru yesterday, I’ve noticed something about the results of our experiments!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“D-Mails have too many uncertain variables. We can never be sure what will happen when we send one.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s not like we can do anything about that. After all, the result is up to whoever receives the mail.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Of course, if you can analyze the recipient’s psychology, then you might be able to manipulate them into doing what you want.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Though that might be a bit too much for Hououin Underwear here.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You just wanted to say underwear, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Underwear aside, the fact is that D-Mail is still far from complete.”[%p]
I need a more reliable time machine before I can expose SERN and the Organization and plunge the world into chaos.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I called you here today. The purpose of today’s Round Table Conference is--”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Another Round Table?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you want a Round Table Conference that much, at least go buy a round table.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Remember what Okarin said, Chris-chan? The round table is in our hearts.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Mayuri-san, you’re really innocent. But you shouldn’t take everything Okabe says seriously.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The round table doesn’t matter now. More importantly, the purpose of today’s meeting...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is to explore methods of true physical time travel, not just D-Mail, with the objective of sending someone to the past like SERN has.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t be ridiculous.”[%p]
That was fast.[%p]
And she’s glaring at me even harder than she was during the whole underwear thing.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“SERN has the best equipment in the world, and even after nine years, they still haven’t succeeded.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We can’t possibly hope to accomplish something like that.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’ll become a GelOkarin! Ehehe!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Kinda sounds like [color index="820000"]Gero Froggy[color index="800000"]. Why did those things get popular, anyway?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This isn’t a laughing matter...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Isn’t it too early to give up? Haven’t we already succeeded with D-Mail, a first in human history?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But we’re not the first. Didn’t SERN do it before us?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Humanity’s first time-traveling email. For we who have achieved that miracle, nothing is impossible!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Such baseless confidence. Anyway, wasn’t it just a coincidence that we discovered D-Mail?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We still haven’t figured out what’s functioning as the lifter.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We just need to figure that out, don’t we?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s futile.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“How do you solve a problem that even SERN can’t figure out?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you can’t set the destination, then you don’t know where you’ll leap to.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ll pass on leaping into deep space, thanks.”[%p]
That is a problem.[%p]
If you can’t control where you’ll end up, your time machine is worthless.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait a second.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We don’t set the destination when we send a D-Mail, yet it still arrives where it’s supposed to. How do you explain that?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Now that you mention it...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You set the mail address, right? Isn’t that enough?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Is it? I don’t think a phone signal can be received from millions of kilometers away.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I bet you’d get a busy signal or something!”[%p]
I stare at my phone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe our cellphones are acting like black holes and [color index="820000"]white holes[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You shouldn’t speculate like that. You have zero basis.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is it possible that we form a wormhole?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No wormholes have ever been confirmed to exist.”[%p]
I groan.[%p]
Kurisu and Daru fall silent. The problem has them stumped too.[%p]
Mayuri’s the only one smiling. She probably doesn’t understand and is just smiling because she feels like it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In any case, the cold, hard truth is that D-Mails arrive precisely when and where we want them to. We’re ahead of SERN in that regard.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now, can we apply D-Mail technology to physical time travel?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But with D-Mails, you can only send 36 bytes of data.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“No way you can send a whole person with that kind of limit.”[%p]
It’s the same problem that SERN is having, and the reason their subjects turn into jellymen.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you want to become GelOkarin, I’m not stopping you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Recalling the fate of SERN’s researchers makes my skin crawl.[%p]
Kerr black holes. Ring singularities. Super gravitational space-time distortions.[%p]
If you can adjust the lifter’s volume of electron injection, you might be able to make the ring singularities naked.[%p]
But even SERN is having a hard time controlling the lifter. Even if we do figure out what’s functioning as the lifter in our time machine, I doubt we’ll be able to solve the problem easily.[%p]
Meaning that at present, we can only send a mere 36 bytes of data.[%p]
I wonder how much data there is in a human body.[%p]
I bet it’s more than an [color index="820000"]exa[color index="800000"]byte...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It would be best to leave physical transfer aside for now. Sending data through time is an amazing feat by itself. We should be satisfied with what we’ve got.”[%p]
Sending data through time is enough, huh?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Such pessimism is unbecoming of a scientist sworn to uncover the secrets of the universe.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m telling you to know your limits.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you’re going to uncover the secrets of the universe, you need personnel, equipment, and funding to rival SERN’s.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s one thing to set lofty goals, but this impoverished lab has no resources to speak of.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ve been thinking. Maybe we should bring the PhoneWave to a proper research institution and entrust it to a specialist.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“SERN’s keeping their time machine research top secret, so if we make an official announcement, it’ll benefit the future of mankind.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...If we make an official announcement, the Organization will become aware of my existence.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh come on! I’m being serious here. This isn’t the time for your childish--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And we’ve hacked into SERN.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Those heartless bastards will do anything, even experiment on human beings. And behind them is a power greater than all the nations of the Earth.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If we make the PhoneWave (name subject to change) public, they might have us erased.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...You watch too many movies.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The name ’Committee of 300’ appeared in actual SERN documents.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yeah, but...”[%p]
Kurisu’s tone weakens.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s kinda scared...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“If they find out about our hacking, they’ll seriously have us killed. I didn’t make any mistakes that could give us away, of course.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Also, and this is the biggest problem--”[%p]
I lower my voice and look hard at each one of them in turn.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If we go public, we won’t be able to do cool stuff with D-Mails anymore!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why you...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Muhahaha! No way I’m giving up such an awesome machine!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am Hououin Kyouma! The insane mad scientist who rules space and time! What I desire is -- that’s right -- CHAOS!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“[color index="820000"]This guy’s hopeless. Better do something quick.[color index="800000"]”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Eh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hm?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hwe?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ah...”[%p]
Everybody freezes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina. Are you an @channe--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Shut up! I’m not, okay!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu gives me her sharpest glare yet.[%p]
Her eyes are so cold, my spine turns to ice.[%p]
I nod and swallow what I was going to say.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Th-that reminds me, Daru. Have you made any progress hacking into SERN?”[%p]
He did say it would take time to learn how to use the IBN 5100.[%p]
But I know he’s been coming to the lab every day to work on it.[%p]
His monitor is always displaying some kind of program, and his fingers are always busy on the keyboard.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah, right now I’m combing SERN’s massive database.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It would take years to read it all. For now, I’ve passed everything that looks important to Makise-shi for translation.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Basically, I’ve gone as deep as I can go.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“SERN belongs to me now.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thank goodness you’re on my side.”[%p]
If only you weren’t so weak to seduction.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina. Report on the status of these translations.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Can you stop talking like that? It’s pretentious and annoying as hell.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hell☆”[%p]
Mayuri takes a cute, idol-like pose and smiles for some reason.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Chris-chan, as Okarin’s childhood friend, I promise you’ll get used to how he talks eventually.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I just hope it doesn’t take ten years...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So you’re saying you want to stay with me for ten years? In other words, you want to work at this lab for the rest of your--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It was sarcasm, get it? Sarcasm.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Oh.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Give me your report, Christina. If you don’t, I’ll call you an ’@channeler’--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Didn’t you hear me the first time!?”[%p]
She glares at me again. My blood goes cold.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ve been working on the translation when I have time, but so far I haven’t seen anything new about time travel.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It looks like SERN is still struggling to find a solution.”[%p]
Maybe they’ll have to wait another 24 years like Titor said.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, any other results?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, it looks like SERN’s in the middle of a big project, so the LHC’s at full operation.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m trying to see if I can cut in and maybe use it secretly.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What? No way.”[%p]
Kurisu’s stunned.[%p]
Honestly, so am I.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Is that amazing?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s not amazing. It’s downright outrageous!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Super Hacka, [color index="820000"]what a monster[color index="800000"]!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Christina. Are you doing that on purpose?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ugh... d-doing what?”[%p]
She’s an @channeler. No doubt about it.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Anyway, I’m just doing it for laughs. It’s not like we have any reason to use the LHC.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It sounds like things are going smoothly. When do you begin stage three of the operation?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What’s stage three?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“SERN’s most secret, forbidden domain. We’re going to free the darkness hidden inside.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“In Japanese please.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The IBN 5100 database. I’m asking if you’ve started hacking it yet.”[%p]
Daru frowns.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We can’t, remember?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You said all we needed was an IBN 5100 of our own!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Right. That’s the problem. We can’t do anything without one.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Again, this feeling of disconnect.[%p]
The conversation isn’t making sense.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I got you an IBN 5100. You haven’t started working on it yet?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? You got one? When?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Puzzled, I look at Kurisu and Mayuri.[%p]
Mayuri looks confused, like always.[%p]
Kurisu meets my eyes and shrugs her shoulders.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“First I’ve heard of it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Impossible!”[%p]
That just can’t be![%p]
I dash into the development room.[%p]
The IBN 5100 I borrowed from Yanabayashi Shrine should be on the shelf inside. It’s in a cardboard box, and it weighs 25 kilos, too heavy for a single person to carry.[%p]
But when I go to look...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...It’s gone.”[%p]
It’s no longer where I left it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The IBN 5100 was right here! Where did it go!?”[%p]
Everyone looks at me in surprise.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why are you staring at me like that!? The legendary PC that was donated to Yanabayashi Shrine!! You’ve seen it! Remember!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I don’t remember.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Donated to Yanabayashi Shrine? That’s stupid.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You sure you weren’t hallucinating? It’s hot these days.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Despair drags me down like quicksand.[%p]
We can’t hack that database without the IBN 5100![%p]
Who stole it? The Organization? SERN?[%p]
SERN is a possibility. Maybe they noticed our hacking and stole the IBN 5100 from the lab.[%p]
No no no.[%p]
Even if they could steal the IBN 5100 from the lab, they can’t steal Mayuri and Daru’s memories of it![%p]
What happened!?[%p]
Kiryu Moeka.[%p]
Maybe I should check with her first.[%p]
Could someone other than Moeka have stolen the IBN 5100?[%p]
I consider the possibilities.[%p]
The next name that comes to mind is--[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t tell me it was John Titor!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course! Titor’s goal was to obtain an IBN 5100! And I’ve already contacted him several times. But how did he get my personal information!?”[%p]
I send the mail to Moeka.[%p]
I don’t know if I’ll get a response.[%p]
Why am I sending her a mail like this?[%p]
The reason’s obvious.[%p]
I want to test her.[%p]
If it was an inside crime, then Moeka’s the prime suspect, considering her strange attachment to the IBN 5100.[%p]
I wait a while, but no reply comes.[%p]
Of course, even if Moeka were the culprit, she wouldn’t just admit it.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Calm down.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Tell us what happened. You don’t have to be precise. Just say whatever comes to mind. We can work it out later.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-yeah...”[%p]
I wipe my sweat with a handkerchief, then slowly explain the purpose of the IBN 5100 and how I came to obtain one.[%p]
While I’m trying to decide whether I should send the mail, Kurisu tells me to calm down.[%p]
A high school girl is chiding me... She dares make a fool of Hououin Kyouma!?[%p]
Irritated, I explain the purpose of the IBN 5100 and how I came to obtain one.[%p]
During that time, I also send Moeka a mail for confirmation.[%p]
