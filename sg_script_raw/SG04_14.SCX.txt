[name]Kurisu[line]“Hmmm...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The IBN 5100 may have disappeared as a result of changes someone made to the past.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ohh! So you believe me!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But from my perspective, all of the D-Mails we sent so far were trivial.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, there’s that one we sent when we first realized PhoneWave-chan was a time machine, right?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The one that said ’Okarin is a perv’.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And during the preliminary D-Mail experiments, I sent dozens to Okabe’s phone. But they were all insubstantial, so I don’t think they could’ve changed the past.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I sent two of them when I was trying to win the match against Faris.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There was one more. The first mail Okabe accidentally sent that said I was dead.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But from my perspective, we sent several more.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You mean how you sent the winning LOTO SIX numbers? And how Luka-chan bought a ticket with those numbers, but didn’t win?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But nobody aside from Okabe remembers him sending it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I showed you guys afterwards. It was still in my phone’s arrival history.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We were so close.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Is that all?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No. There’s more. Moeka and Lukako each sent a D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh, right. That’s what you claim, but Hashida, Mayuri-san, and I don’t remember either of those.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Owww... Mayushii’s getting a headache...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I already told you guys. I’m the only one who keeps his memories after the world changes.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So according to your perspective, when did the IBN 5100 disappear? Did it just happen? When’s the last time you remember seeing it in the lab?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well...”[%p]
I put my index finger to my forehead and search my memories.[%p]
IBN 5100... IBN 5100...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sure... it was August 3rd. I remember it being in the lab on August 3rd.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you certain?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I... think so.”[%p]
So many things have happened. My memories are a jumble.[%p]
Let’s go over the events which led to me obtaining the IBN 5100.[%p]
I heard that Faris was a retro PC maniac who knew about the IBN 5100.[%p]
I learned that nine years ago, she donated her IBN 5100 to Yanabayashi Shrine. I asked Lukako’s dad for help, and he leant me the IBN 5100 just like that. Mission complete.[%p]
At the very least, Faris and Lukako should remember what happened.[%p]
I should give them a call.[%p]
First up is Lukako.[%p]
[name]Luka[line][color index="8A0000"]“Hello, Okabe-san.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line][color index="8A0000"]“Um... p-please forget what you saw the other day...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I saw something?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line][color index="8A0000"]“My... cosplay...”[%p]
Oh, that?[%p]
That was just Lukako getting embarrassed for no reason.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“More importantly, I have questions about the IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line][color index="8A0000"]“The... eyebeam... five?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“IBN 5100. About nine years ago, someone dedicated a retro PC to Yanabayashi Shrine. That’s the one. Know anything?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line][color index="8A0000"]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line][color index="8A0000"]“Y-yes.”[%p]
He remembers! Lukako really remembers![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just a while ago, I came to the shrine looking for it, didn’t I!? And then I asked your old man and he let me borrow it. Right!?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line][color index="8A0000"]“Eh...?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line][color index="8A0000"]“I don’t...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Right?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line][color index="8A0000"]“I don’t remember anything like that...”[%p]
What?[%p]
Is this another effect of changing the past?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The IBN 5100 was at the shrine though, right? Is it there now?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line][color index="8A0000"]“Um... I don’t know the details...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where are you now? Is your old man there?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line][color index="8A0000"]“...No.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Damn. Okay. Sorry for calling you so suddenly.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line][color index="8A0000"]“N-no problem. I’m sorry that I couldn’t help..”[%p]
The IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine. That’s a fact.[%p]
And Lukako knew that.[%p]
I need to check if it’s still there or not.[%p]
Could the IBN 5100 have returned to the shrine?[%p]
Did that huge retro PC sprout legs and trot back?[%p]
That’s just silly.[%p]
But gelbanas have “teleported” out of the microwave.[%p]
Moeka also instantly moved from the lab to somewhere else.[%p]
Considering that, it’s entirely possible that the same thing happened to the IBN 5100. Maybe I should go check later.[%p]
Next is Faris.[%p]
By the way, I haven’t told Faris my phone number. I’m afraid that if I talk to her on the phone, she’ll drag me into her usual nonsense.[%p]
So there’s only one option.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, I need to contact Faris.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hweh?”[%p]
Mayuri’s eating an eclair. She must have stuck some in the fridge when I wasn’t looking.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Want one, Okarin? They’re delicious♪”[%p]
Now that she mentions it, Kurisu and Daru are eating too.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You people don’t have a care in the world, do you!? There’s some crazy stuff happening here!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Or it could all just be in your head. No need to panic.”[%p]
It’s not just in my head. It’s not![%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You need Feris-chan for something? I wonder if she’s working today.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Faris-tan’s off today.”[%p]
Well done, Daru. You know Faris’s schedule better than her coworker.[%p]
I award you the title of Faris Stalker.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You know her phone number, right? See if you can get ahold of her.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay!”[%p]
Mayuri takes out her phone and makes a call.[%p]
After a short wait, Mayuri smiles.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Feris-chan? Good afternyan-nyan♪ It’s Mayushii, nyan♪”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Nya, nyan...?”[%p]
Oh, right. This is the first time Kurisu has heard Mayuri speak NyanNyanian.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Sorry to bother you on your day off. Okarin said he wants to talk to you about something. Wanna talk to him?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh? You know. Okarin!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...Kyouma? Who’s Kyouma?”[%p]
The hell are they talking about?[%p]
By the way, Faris is the only person who calls me by my true name, Hououin Kyouma. I’m thankful for that, but she still drives me crazy.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m handing you over, okay?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Here you go, Okarin.”[%p]
I take Mayuri’s phone.[%p]
Faris’ face is displayed on the LCD. She’s wearing cat ears even though it’s her day off.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. Hououin Kyouma.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“Nyao♪ How unusual for Kyouma to contact me, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s something I need to ask you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Long ago, you donated a retro PC to Yanabayashi shrine. Am I mistaken?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“Nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? What’s ’nyan’ supposed to mean, nya?”[%p]
Ah crap, I started to talk like her.[%p]
Kurisu bursts out laughing. Looks like she heard.[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“It means you’re right, nya. Though I didn’t know it was called the IBN 5100 until recently, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? Why recently?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“Daru-nyan told me, nya.”[%p]
So that’s it...[%p]
At any rate, Faris has confirmed that the IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
So did the IBN 5100 disappear from the lab after I retrieved it?[%p]
No, Kurisu and the others lost their memories of me bringing it back to the lab. So I’m considering two possibilities:[%p]
One. I went to the shrine, but didn’t acquire the IBN 5100. It’s still at the shrine.[%p]
Two. Before I went to the shrine, someone moved the IBN 5100 somewhere else.[%p]
Looks like I’ll have to go to the shrine after all.[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“So what about the retro PC, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah, nothing...”[%p]
Faris was a retro PC maniac, wasn’t she?[%p]
Let’s just make sure.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you have any other information on the IBN 5100? It’s a super rare PC.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“As a charisma-build maid, I expect you have a strong network in Akiba, correct? I’d like you to use that network and search for any IBN 5100s in Akiba now.”[%p]
We only need to find one. It doesn’t matter if it’s the one I found at the shrine.[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“Hmnya...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“I can look. But for a price, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A price?”[%p]
Is she trying to strike a deal?[%p]
That’s unexpected.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Let’s hear it.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“I want you to come over to Faris’s apartment, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where is this apartment of yours?”[%p]
I quickly prepare a memo pad and write down the address Faris recites.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, so you live in Akiba.”[%p]
That’ll make things quick. Judging by the address, it should be right next to the station.[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“I’ll be waiting, nyan♪”[%p]
I return Mayuri’s phone and stand up from the couch.[%p]
Let’s stop by Yanabayashi Shrine and then head to Faris’s place.[%p]
