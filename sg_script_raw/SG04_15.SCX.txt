[name]Rintaro[line]“...Well?”[%p]
I look over my shoulder with a frown.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why are you guys tagging along?”[%p]
Mayuri and Daru are following me, even though I didn’t ask them to come.[%p]
Kurisu stayed back at the lab.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s never been to Feris-chan’s place.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I thought I’d like to visit once. Hehe♪”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I mean, it’s Faris-tan’s home. No way I’m missing this.”[%p]
It might be a bad idea to take the Faris stalker along. A really bad idea...[%p]
Well, whatever. If Faris has a problem with it, then we can send him away when we get there. Nothing else matters as long as I get Faris to search for an IBN 5100.[%p]
Of course, if the IBN 5100’s at Yanabayashi shrine, then that won’t even be necessary.[%p]
I stop by the shrine, but Lukako’s not there.[%p]
I guess he was out when he answered the phone earlier.[%p]
I’ve got no other choice, so I go to the humble shrine office and press the intercom button. Luka’s dad comes out.[%p]
When I try asking him if the IBN 5100 was donated to the shrine, he answers “it certainly was.”[%p]
But after he tries looking for it, he says he can’t find it anywhere, and he has no idea where it went.[%p]
I ask if he lent me the IBN 5100 before, but that event is gone from his memory.[%p]
What’s going on here?[%p]
While heading towards Faris’s place, I analyse the situation.[%p]
The IBN 5100 has disappeared from the lab, even though it was there just a few days ago.[%p]
It has also disappeared from Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
It’s like some god is messing with me, moving it every time I get close.[%p]
The D-Mails definitely have something to do with this.[%p]
I can only begin to imagine how the past has changed.[%p]
At any rate, it looks like we’ll have to rely on Faris.[%p]
The usual weekend crowd packs the front of Akiba Station.[%p]
Girls dressed in maid outfits and school uniforms diligently distribute fliers to the passers-by.[%p]
I appreciate their efforts in this godawful heat.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mmm...?”[%p]
After a few melanin-boosting moments walking in the sun, I come to a sudden stop.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What’s wrong?”[%p]
I’ve caught sight of a woman squatting on the side of the road, hugging her knees and typing on her phone.[%p]
That’s got to be Lab Mem 005, Kiryu Moeka.[%p]
Wait. Is she still a lab mem? Mayuri and Daru don’t remember her.[%p]
Well, whatever![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What luck!”[%p]
There’s something I need to ask her![%p]
I run up to Moeka.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Shining Finger!”[%p]
I try getting her attention, but she’s stuck in her own little world.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I-B-N... I-B-N... I-B-N...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Gonegonegone... why is it gone... why can’t I find it... is it really in this town... don’t tell me it’s already...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you listening, Shining Finger!?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“It should be... should be here... has to be... FB said so...”[%p]
No reaction.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kiryu Moeka!”[%p]
Moeka stops muttering.[%p]
She finally looks up -- actually, she just looks at my feet.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Okabe-kun?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you take the IBN 5100 from the lab?”[%p]
Mayuri and Daru look askance at me, but I ignore them.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t want to believe that it was you. You are a fellow lab mem, after all. But you did display an unhealthy attachment to that computer.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, was it you?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You... found an IBN 5100?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I found one, but it’s gone missing.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Missing?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry. I won’t report you to the police. As long as you return it, that is.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...?”[%p]
The normally expressionless Moeka frowns in bewilderment.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You... don’t remember, do you?”[%p]
Moeka shakes her head faintly.[%p]
Then she looks down and begins operating her phone at high speed.[%p]
She really doesn’t know?[%p]
If the IBN 5100 had been stolen from the lab, then Moeka would be my first suspect.[%p]
But the IBN 5100 disappeared from Yanabayashi Shrine, not the lab. It can’t have been Moeka’s doing.[%p]
So it was the D-Mail?[%p]
Or perhaps it was the work of SERN?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry, Finger.”[%p]
I squat in front of Moeka and bow my head.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I suspected you. A lab mem! A comrade!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m the worst sort of man. Hit me, please. I don’t mind.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But there’s one thing I want you to know. In my long years running from the Organization, I’ve grown unable to trust anyone.”[%p]
Why? Why did I have to be born with these gifts that others so covet!?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Once I start to suspect, everyone looks suspicious. No matter how many comrades gather around me, I always feel alone. Pitiful, aren’t I?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“D-did you just ignore my entire speech?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hey, Okarin. You’re doing improv in the middle of the street. Has the heat gone to your head?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
