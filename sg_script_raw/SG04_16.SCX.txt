So Moeka doesn’t know I had an IBN 5100.[%p]
And judging by her responses, she hasn’t found one either.[%p]
I feel like I’m getting farther and farther away from my goal.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’ve been thinking...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Moeka-san sure is pretty, isn’t she? She’s got a nice figure, and she’s tall, too!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“She’d look great in one of my costumes. Ehehe!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wh...at?”[%p]
For a second, I doubt my ears.[%p]
I approach Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’ve met Moeka before?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Sure I have!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When!?”[%p]
I grab Mayuri by the shoulders and shake her. Her head bounces back and forth.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ummmmm?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“When youuuuu brouuuught herrrr toooo theeee laaaaab!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I did...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru. Do you remember her?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Sure. We met at the lab.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
After Moeka sent her D-Mail, Mayuri, Daru, and Kurisu behaved as if they had never met her before.[%p]
But now both Mayuri and Daru know her?[%p]
Does that mean Moeka’s past was reconstructed again?[%p]
Given the timing, it has to be Lukako’s D-Mail that did it.[%p]
But all he did was tell his mother to eat a lot of vegetables.[%p]
How can that be related to the lab mems’ knowledge of Moeka?[%p]
Is this another example of the Butterfly Effect?[%p]
The cause doesn’t match the effect at all.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin? We need to get going. Faris-chan’s waiting, remember?”[%p]
That’s true.[%p]
Let’s think about the Moeka issue later.[%p]
Right now, we should look for the address written on the memo pad.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By the way, Mayuri. What’s Faris’s real name?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whoa, Okarin! Hold on there! Faris-tan’s name is Faris NyanNyan. She doesn’t have any other names!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Face reality, Daru. Faris NyanNyan is just her professional name.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uwahh, you’re the worst! Why do you have to crush my dreams like that, man?”[%p]
Quit grumbling.[%p]
You just can’t handle the truth![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, Mayuri? Don’t you know?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hmmm, is it okay for Mayushii to tell you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not like you took a vow of secrecy, right? And besides, we’re visiting her home, so we’ll find out soon enough.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh. I guess you’re right...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But just promise me you’ll keep it secret, okay? Like from the masters who come to MayQueen.”[%p]
I nod.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay. Feris-chan’s real name is Akiha Rumiho-chan!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nyah nyah nyah, not listening!”[%p]
Daru covers his ears and drowns the sound out.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Akiha...”[%p]
The same characters as in Akihabara. Appropriate.[%p]
