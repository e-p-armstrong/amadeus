Our destination turns out to be the high-rise apartment building next to UPX.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Waahh... awwwesome...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait... seriously?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She lives... here?”[%p]
We stand there for a while, staring wide-eyed at the towering building before us.[%p]
According to the address Faris gave me, she lives on the top floor... all the way up there.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did we get the wrong address?”[%p]
No. I wouldn’t make such a stupid mistake.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t tell me Faris is working for the Organization!?”[%p]
I quickly scan the area.[%p]
No suspicious figures in sight.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Does she have men in black waiting to haul us off to a re-education camp!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nice delusion, man. The truth is stranger than fiction.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Besides, don’t you think it would be super moe if Faris-tan turned out to be a ’rich girl’ character?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nice delusion yourself, man.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Anyway, let’s go in!”[%p]
When we call the top floor room via intercom, we’re greeted by the voice of an elderly man. He lets us in immediately once I introduce myself as Hououin Kyouma.[%p]
It feels like we’re walking into a trap, but I can’t turn back now.[%p]
When we get off the elevator, the elderly man from the intercom is there to lead us inside.[%p]
He turns out to be a silver-haired gentleman in a tuxedo.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“A real live butler...”[%p]
He does indeed look like a stereotypical butler. He fits the bill so well, you wouldn’t think he was anything else.[%p]
[name]Butler[line]“Mistress. Mr.Hououin Kyouma and friends have arrived.”[%p]
The butler leads us into a room.[%p]
Faris is standing before a large window with a panoramic view of Akiba.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Thanks, Kuroki nya.”[%p]
I’ve never seen her wearing anything other than the usual maid uniform, so it’s refreshing to see her in her plain clothes.[%p]
But why does she still have her cat ears on?[%p]
I want to ask. I can’t help but wonder.[%p]
But I restrain myself.[%p]
Even if I did ask, Faris would just say something like “I was born with these nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyanya? Mayushii and Daru-nyan came too, nyan?”[%p]
Faris’s eyes twinkle when she sees Mayuri and Daru behind me.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Feris-chan, good afternyan-nyan♪”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Mhmm, casual Faris-tan... too cute!”[%p]
I silence the mouth-breathing Daru by introducing his ribs to my elbow.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They followed me. If you don’t want them here, I’ll send them home.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“No fur off my back, nya. Everyone’s welcome nyan♪”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait, you talk like that even in your own home?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“What do you mean, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gonna play dumb, [color index="A0140000"]Akiha Rumiho[color index="800000"]?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris is Faris, nya.”[%p]
Whatever.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Fine. What I really want to know is how you get to live in a luxury apartment in Akiba’s best district!”[%p]
I look around the room again.[%p]
The interior design and furnishings give a very refined impression.[%p]
It’s elegant without being ostentatious.[%p]
Actually, it’s kind of like a model home.[%p]
There’s nothing to suggest that this room is lived in. No dirty clothes, no used dishware -- not even a speck of dust.[%p]
That butler, or maybe even some real maids -- if there’s a butler, there have to be maids, right? -- must be constantly cleaning up.[%p]
Speaking of the butler, he’s disappeared. I didn’t even notice him leave.[%p]
He’s clearly a master butler if he can move so quietly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris... just who are you?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Like I said, Faris is Faris, nyan.”[%p]
Faris says it so nonchalantly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t play dumb. If you don’t explain yourself, I’m leaving!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“H-how arrogant... we’re the ones who came here to ask Faris-tan for a favor, aren’t we?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hmmya... Well, if you must know...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“This land originally belonged to my family, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hah?”[%p]
What did she just say?[%p]
This land originally belonged to her family?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh! So that’s why you’re Akiha-san!”[%p]
Mayuri’s exclamation connects the dots in my head.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Akiha... You mean you’re descended from the hereditary landholders of Akihabara!?”[%p]
Faris nods with a proud expression.[%p]
So she really is a ’rich girl’ character.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“By the way, Faris has considerable influence on Akihabara’s development, nyan.”[%p]
Faris wriggles her slender waist and makes a gesture like a cat washing its face.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It was Faris who convinced the development board to actively promote moe culture in Akiba, nya.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow! That’s amazing!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’ve been going to development meetings since I was little, nya.”[%p]
So basically, the chaotic changes in Akiba are all a result of this catgirl’s whims?[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]What a monster![%e]
[name]Faris[line]“But please keep all this a secret, nyan.”[%p]
Faris’s expression suddenly darkens.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You wanna know, nya?”[%p]
Faris approaches me with a bewitching expression.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“That’s because...”[%p]
Faris gently strokes my cheek with her cool, slender fingers. I feel myself falling under her spell.[%p]
And then--[%p]
She grins.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris is Faris, nya♪”[%p]
Damn you, catgirl! How dare you make a fool of me!?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I want all my fans to keep treating me the same as always, nyan☆”[%p]
Daru starts fist pumping when he sees Faris’s cutesy act.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ll treat you! I’ll treat you at full force!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s your fan too! Your maid spirit is really amazing!”[%p]
Mayuri and Daru might have fallen for her charms, but not I.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t care about any of this!”[%p]
I thrust my finger at Faris.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do not defy me, Faris NyanNyan, or I’ll paint your expensive wallpaper with blood.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You called me to your home so you could show off your status and try to gain leverage in our negotiations. But it’s futile.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“For you are dealing with the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What kind of reason is that...”[%p]
Heh. Perfect![%p]
Now Faris will tremble in fear and beg for my forgiveness.[%p]
Or so I thought, but instead, she looks at me with gleaming eyes.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyan♪ Faris loves forceful men, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What... did she say?”[%p]
That’s my line.[%p]
I wanted to threaten her, not seduce her.[%p]
Is Faris a masochist!?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Honestly, Faris didn’t want to talk so much about herself, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Most people, when they learn who I am, stop seeing me as Faris, nya. They only see the Akiha name.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris and Akiha Rumiho want to be seen as separate purrsons, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s nothing to separate. You [color index="A0140000"]are[color index="800000"] Faris NyanNyan, are you not?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nya?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“For once I agree with you, Okarin! Whenever she speaks NyanNyanian and wears her cat ears, she is Faris-tan!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re just being overly self-conscious, Faris.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I don’t know, nya...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m serious. To me, you will always be the unbeatable cat-eared maid!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyahaha. Thanks, Kyouma.”[%p]
Why is she thanking me?[%p]
Well, she’s probably admiring my incredible magnanimity. Muhahaha![%p]
Now then, let’s finish this idle gossip and get down to business.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris, you said there would be a price to pay in exchange for your help acquiring an IBN 5100. What is your price?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do not test the limits of my good will.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If I unseal my right arm for even an instant, everything will be destroyed, and nothing will remain... just so you know.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Fine by me, nya.”[%p]
Faris points at the cat ears sticking out of her head.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“These cat ears have the power to negate all other powers -- NyanNyan Clear.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“When Kyouma’s power is unleashed, Faris will stop it, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I shouldn’t have mentioned my hand to Faris.[%p]
Faris’s most terrifying power is one known as “Dubbing 10.” It allows her to steal other people’s stories and add them to her own.[%p]
I’m the one who named it, of course. The number 10 doesn’t really mean anything.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Well, I guess I’ll tell you, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“My price...”[%p]
Faris chuckles.[%p]
But I notice something.[%p]
Her eyes aren’t smiling.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Is to let me use your time machine, nya.”[%p]
Yes. I had a feeling that was it.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I heard what you said at MayQueen yesterday. You’ve built a time machine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Indeed. We have created the first successful time machine in human history.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uh, SERN was the first.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But don’t misunderstand.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We call it a time machine, but it’s not the kind you can hop into and fly to whenever you want.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“All we can do is send a 36-byte email to someone’s phone in the past.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But even that is worthy of a Nobel Prize in physics. It is a transcendental super invention that will alter the course of human history forever.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It can send an email to someone in the past? That’s awesome! Faris wants to use it, nya!”[%p]
Faris jumps up and down with joy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The time machine is our lab’s greatest secret. If you want to use it, then you must become a lab mem.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“A lab mem? What’s that, nya?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Well, it means you get to be a part of our club♪ Mayushii would be super happy if Feris-chan became a lab mem!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Same here!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That would be AWWWWWRIGHT!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Please join! I’m begging here!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“How do I become a lab mem, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s no contract. We only require that you perform... the blood oath.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“The... blood oath!!”[%p]
The window is closed, but a gust of wind blows through the room. It’s coming from the air conditioner.[%p]
But outside the window, I see rainclouds cover the sky.[%p]
I hear the rumbling of thunder inside my brain.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris NyanNyan, if thou dost desire to join the hallowed order of lab mems, then by the code passed down in High Ancient from an age long forgotten...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Pledge thy flesh, thy bone, thy blood, and thy soul to the Grail of Heaven, and swear fealty everlasting!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This duty fulfilled, the old gods shall grant thee thy lab mem number.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I didn’t understand a word of that...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh no! What do I do? Mayushii never ate any blood loaf. Does that mean Mayushii’s not a lab mem?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Don’t worry, Mayu-shi. This is just Okarin’s usual nonsense.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh! I guess everything’s fine then♪ Thank goodness!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Very well, nya. I shall take the blood oath, nya...”[%p]
With a grim expression, Faris grabs the small knife on top of her desk--[%p]
And suddenly slashes it against her wrist.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“--!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“No!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uh, isn’t that a paper knife?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyahaha♪ Daru-nyan’s right, nya!”[%p]
Gh, she surprised me![%p]
I clear my throat and pull myself together.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Very well, Faris, I invest you as Lab Mem 007.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Purrfect. So now can I use the time machine, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Indeed. But not a word to anyone. Death to traitors. That’s the law of the lab.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It is?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“No. Okarin made it up just now.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Thanks, Kyouma!”[%p]
Faris hugs me by the neck.[%p]
A very sweet aroma tickles my nose.[%p]
And something very soft tickles my...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin, you jerk! I helped make the PhoneWave too!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Really nya? Then Daru-nyan too!”[%p]
Faris flies over to Daru.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m glad she’s so happy, Okarin♪”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh... Mayuri, you really are innocent.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hweh?”[%p]
I take out my phone and put it to my ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. ...Yeah, I’ve got her wrapped around my finger. What did you expect? She’s just a 17-year-old girl.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That catgirl thinks she’s bargained with me to appease her lust for mankind’s dream, the forbidden fruit that is the time machine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But she’s dancing to the tune of Hououin Kyouma!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Hmph, why did I agree to pay her price, you ask? That should be obvious.”[%p]
Then I twist my lips into a grin.[%p]
My razor-sharp shark teeth are probably glistening right now.[%p]
...Damn, I wish I had shark teeth.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That catgirl shall be our guinea pig.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I’m a monster? What a terrible thing to say. Not that you’re [color index="A0140000"]wrong[color index="800000"], exactly. Heh heh heh.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...?”[%p]
Our D-Mail experiments have reached a standstill.[%p]
Kurisu refuses to become a subject, and Mayuri and Daru are too dumb to be useful.[%p]
We managed to experiment on Moeka and Lukako, but we still need more data.[%p]
Along comes Faris.[%p]
She’s going to provide me with both an IBN 5100 and new data. Two birds with one stone![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Right. Faris thinks she’s using us...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But it is we who are using her! She is but a moth drawn to my brilliant flame. Muhahaha!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“As planned, we are proceeding to the next phase of the experiment. This is the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
Someone taps me on the shoulder after I put away my phone.[%p]
Right after that, they blow into my ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mmgh!?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Who were you talking to, nya?”[%p]
Faris is behind me. She must have finished servicing Daru while I was still on the phone.[%p]
No doubt she heard everything.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s too late, Faris NyanNyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’ve already taken the blood oath. If you break it, ruin will befall you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There is no escape.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Ok, nya. So where’s the time machine, nya?”[%p]
She’s certainly in a hurry.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The time machine -- its name is the PhoneWave (name subject to change), by the way -- is in our lab.”[%p]
This time, we’ll make use of the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s original function and send the D-Mail by remote control.[%p]
Kurisu should still be in the lab. I’ll leave the setup to her.[%p]
I ask Faris where she wants the D-Mail to go. She says she’s sending it to her father 10 years ago. I take down his email address.[%p]
The destination is April 3, 2000.[%p]
It has to be at 8am that day, so we use an online calculator to factor in leap years, resulting in 86168 hours.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Umm, so does that mean it has to keep going for 86,000 seconds?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Won’t PhoneWave-chan get tired?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It doesn’t actually have to run the entire duration.”[%p]
Our previous experiments have confirmed that.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The mail reaches the past if you send it as soon as the discharge begins.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In accordance with the Butterfly Effect, the remaining seconds should be canceled out. The experiment never happened.”[%p]
The fact that the D-Mail was sent is erased, leaving behind only the mail in the recipient’s phone.[%p]
At least, that’s what our experiments have shown so far.[%p]
Now, let’s call Kurisu.[%p]
