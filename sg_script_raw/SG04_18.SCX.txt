[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Hallo.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. What’s the situation?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She hung up on me!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Of course she did. Mayu-shi and I are the only ones who can deal with your act, you know?”[%p]
Again![%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Hallo.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s Hououin Kyouma. Don’t hang up.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Oh, it’s Okabe. I was sure it was a prank call.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It shows you my number, doesn’t it!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“You were talking crazy, so I got scared and hung up.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In other words, you fear the insanity of Hououin Kyouma! Well, I suppose you can’t be blamed for--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She hung up! Again!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Like I said, we’re the only ones who can put up with you...”[%p]
I quickly redial.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Hallo.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is Okabe Rintaro. Sorry, but could you mess with the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s settings a little, please?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Well why didn’t you say so?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Hmm... you’re going to use the PhoneWave? I don’t want to anger the guy downstairs, though.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’re about to perform a critical experiment. Understand, assistant? Mister Braun might yell at you, but that small sacrifice will bring mankind’s dream, the time machine, to fruition.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“You’re really irresponsible, you know that?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“...Well? What should I set it to?”[%p]
I tell her Faris’s dad’s mail address.[%p]
And I have her set the timer.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okay, it’s ready.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alright, thanks. Wait a bit.”[%p]
I turn to Faris.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Finished writing what you want to send?”[%p]
I already told her the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s email address.[%p]
Faris nods.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What did you write? You sure it’s something that’ll change the past?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“W-well...”[%p]
Hm? What happened to her usual confidence?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I-it’s embarrassing, nya! A trade secret, nyan!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A secret!? Nonsense! This is science! Unless we know what you’re sending, we can’t verify the results!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“What’s that supposed to mean!? No one said anything about science, nya! I’m using the time machine for myself, not science, nya!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s not fair!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’re one to talk.”[%p]
Daru, you horny fool, are you siding with Faris!?[%p]
And you call yourself a super hacka!?[%p]
Faris covers her phone with her body.[%p]
Looks like she plans on hiding it to the bitter end.[%p]
Should we halt the experiment?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Hey, Okabe. How long are you gonna make me wait?”[%p]
An impatient Kurisu nags me through the phone.[%p]
Don’t rush me, dammit![%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Okarin, it’s probably something private, so I don’t think you should pry...”[%p]
Wh-what? Even Mayuri’s on Faris’s side?[%p]
She was like this with Moeka too.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mmmgh...”[%p]
This is bad.[%p]
I thought I had Faris in the palm of my hand. Was I dancing to her tune all along!?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okabe? If you’re not gonna send anything, I’m hanging up.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-wait! Fine. Activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change).”[%p]
Dammit, I submitted to the catgirl![%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“The discharge is starting.”[%p]
I nod to Faris after getting Kurisu’s report.[%p]
Faris puts her finger on the send button and--[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Click, nya!”[%p]
