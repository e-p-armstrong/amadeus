[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
As the dizziness fades, I exhale slowly and open my eyes.[%p]
Alright, world. Show me your new form![%p]
Man, I wish I knew what kind of mail Faris sent.[%p]
First things first. I’m still in her room. When I look out the window, the Akiba sprawl greets me.[%p]
I scan the room.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okay. Card Open.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh no! Another Virus Card!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Not so fast, nyan♪”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Awww... You took three Link Cards, right? And I got three Virus Cards, right?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s in trouble...”[%p]
What are they doing?[%p]
The three of them are sitting around a table, playing some kind of game.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We still have a Terminal Card. We can turn the tables next turn.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyahaha♪ It’s way too late for that, nya. Faris is going to use the Terminal Card, Virus Checker, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So, which is Mayushii’s last Virus Card, nya?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh no...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’re a monster, Faris-tan.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“H-hey, could you wait one... no, two or three turns, nya? Please, nya?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyaha♪ Not even if you try to copycat Faris, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“No way!”[%p]
Mayuri puts her fingers to both her eyes as if to mime tears.[%p]
Anyway, it looks like they’re playing RaiNet AccessBattlers.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
It happened again. Reading Steiner.[%p]
I am the only person in the world who keeps his memories after the past changes. [%p]
Faris’s D-Mail worked.[%p]
That’s why the three of them are now playing a card game instead of waiting for Faris to press the button.[%p]
Faris never even sent the D-Mail.[%p]
If I look at her phone, there won’t be any record of it in her send history.[%p]
And even if I demand that she tell me what she sent, she won’t be able to answer. Because the very fact that she sent it has been erased.[%p]
The only trace of the D-Mail is in the recipient’s phone -- namely, Faris’s father’s phone ten years ago.[%p]
But that ten-year-old mail data was most likely erased long ago. So I don’t think we can check.[%p]
I have to figure out what changed the hard way.[%p]
Let’s start looking for differences.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Phew... Feris-chan is really strong.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Mayushii started out strong, nya. You have potential, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But don’t think I’ll go easy on you just because we’re playing for fun, nyan!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Besides, I promised Papa that I’d win the next tournyament, nya! I can’t lose to anyone before then, nyan!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Papa?”[%p]
Faris nods happily.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Papa said that if Faris won, he’d take time off work to congratulate me, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I want to congratulate you too. Are you free that night?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Papa and I are having dinner that night, nya.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You know, we should all go cheer at the finals!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Thanks nya♪”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Isn’t your final opponent the Viral Attackers duo?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“No one had heard of them until they defeated Faris-tan’s rivals, Idiyona.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Faris-tan’s duels with Idiyona were all god tier, so I was looking forward to it.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I haven’t seen any other RaiNetter matches, but are the Viral Attackers really that furrocious?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, they’re not a threat to Faris-tan. Faris-tan is the strongest. Faris-tan is a goddess!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyan♪ Stop it, nya. You’re embarrassing me, nya!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
As I listen to their conversation, I feel a strange churning in my gut.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]Something’s not right here.[%e]
A voice whispers from deep within, deeper than reason.[%p]
I play the conversation back in my head and soon realize the source of my discomfort.[%p]
The Faris I knew had never been to an official RaiNet tournament.[%p]
And yet now she’s about to compete in the [color index="A0140000"]tournament finals[color index="800000"].[%p]
Which means she’s been going to tournaments for a while.[%p]
Is this the change that Faris wanted to make?[%p]
Considering the recipient was her father, maybe he was strict and wouldn’t let her go to tournaments.[%p]
But is that a reason to change the past?[%p]
Faris is only 17 years old. It’s not too late for her to start participating in tournaments.[%p]
If there were an age limit to RaiNet tournaments, that would be one thing...[%p]
I guess it was just that important to her?[%p]
At that moment, someone knocks on the door.[%p]
The door opens halfway and a middle-aged man appears.[%p]
It’s not the butler.[%p]
[name]Faris’ Dad[line]“Excuse me. Rumiho. Do you have a minute?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Papa!”[%p]
Faris quickly gets up and leaves the room.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whoa, Faris-tan’s dad... Shouldn’t we say hello?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“He’s a CEO, right? Wow...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Faris soon returns.[%p]
Then she turns to us and puts her hands together in a gesture of apology.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Sorry nya! Faris has to go out with Papa, nya.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay. I guess we’ll see you later, then.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But Faris-tan, what about my match? You promised to give me a hands-on lesson -- you know, really work me over.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Pretty sure I didn’t, nya.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Of course you didn’t... I was just making it up...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Daru-kun, you shouldn’t trouble Feris-chan like that.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Come on, Okarin. Let’s go back to the lab.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You know, Kyouma’s been awfully quiet, nya. Something wrong, nyan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nothing. I was just looking at Akiba, watching the ignorant masses scurry about in search of momentary surcease from the pain of existence.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s Okarin for you... batshit crazy.”[%p]
Faris, her dad, and their butler see us off. Her dad tells us to come visit again.[%p]
