Faris’s dad seems like a cool guy.[%p]
He’s not pompous like you expect rich people to be.[%p]
The sun is setting, but there’s still a crowd in front of Akiba Station.[%p]
More foreigners than usual. People come from all over the world to buy electronics and otaku goods in Akiba, but it looks like the satellite is attracting some as well.[%p]
Man, it’s hot.[%p]
Less than a minute outside and I’m already drenched in sweat.[%p]
Faris’s air-conditioned apartment was a little slice of heaven.[%p]
I’d love air conditioning in the lab, but we don’t have that kind of money.[%p]
Anyway, how about some food?[%p]
I turn around to ask Daru and Mayushii what they think.[%p]
Mayuri’s not there.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh? Where’d Mayuri go?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? You’re right. She’s gone.”[%p]
Did Stardust Handshake activate again?[%p]
I scan the area.[%p]
There she is, walking casually towards the station.[%p]
She’s already about 50 meters away.[%p]
I chase after her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, where are you going!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin! Um, Mayushii was thinking about stopping by Nakano Broadway before going home.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you’re going home, then why didn’t you say so?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe. Sorry. All I could think about was going to Nakano.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Mayu-shi’s like some kinda ninja. Never noticed she was gone.”[%p]
Mayuri does this a lot.[%p]
She just wanders off without saying anything.[%p]
And just like Daru said, you never notice she’s gone.[%p]
So when you turn around to look for her, it’s like she vanished into thin air.[%p]
Stardust Handshake and Sneaking Fade -- why did her powers have to be so annoying?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What business do you have in Nakano, anyway?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Well, a Sorrow Sword doujinshi came out yesterday.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Porn?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“No, but the illustrator is Kouga Yui-san. Mayushii thinks it’s finally time to get serious about costumes again.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Kouga Yui? She was the character designer for last year’s [color index="820000"]Gunbam[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Buy me one too.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okey dokey♪”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you guys talking about? If you want doujinshi, why not go to Toranoana? It’s right over there.”[%p]
Daru and Mayuri stare at me blankly.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“There, where?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You know, there! Right over--”[%p]
I follow my pointing finger.[%p]
Toranoana isn’t there.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...?”[%p]
I rub my eyes and blink several times. It doesn’t help.[%p]
Maybe I’m looking in the wrong place.[%p]
I check up and down the street, but no, it’s nowhere to be found.[%p]
And what’s more, I can’t find Animate either. It’s supposed to be right next to Toranoana.[%p]
Instead, I see electronics stores. Daiichi Kaden and T-2ONE Minami.[%p]
Never seen them before in my life.[%p]
Wait...[%p]
I remember Mister Braun saying that Akiba used to have a lot more electronics shops.[%p]
Many of them closed. I think Daiichi Kaden and T-2ONE Minami were among them.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where the hell did Toranoana and Animate go!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Have you lost it, man?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“There aren’t any Toranoanas or Animates in Akiba. That’s why Mayushii’s going to Nakano to buy doujinshi.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean there aren’t any!? They were there yesterday, weren’t they!?”[%p]
What about earlier today?[%p]
I wasn’t really paying attention on the way to Faris’s apartment, but I’m pretty sure they were still there.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“There’s no moe stores in Akiba, man. You know that. The holy land of moe is Nakano.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But Akiba is the holy land of moe! The whole world knows that!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Has the heat finally gone to your head, Okarin? Akiba is the electric town. If you opened a moe store here, the electronics otaku would riot.”[%p]
This feeling again![%p]
Dissonance. My memories don’t match reality.[%p]
The past has changed.[%p]
Part of me knows what has happened.[%p]
But I still can’t help but ask.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What about Mandarake?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Nope.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]”Akiba-o!?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Of course there’s an Akiba-o.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I mean Akiba-okoku, where they sell doujinshi!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The hell’s that?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“They sell doujinshi at Akiba-o?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Of course not. That would be crazy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gamers!? Ramutara!?”[%p]
They shake their heads.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“MelonBooks!? Asobit City!?”[%p]
They look confused.[%p]
So basically...[%p]
I swallow hard.[%p]
I finally understand.[%p]
It’s hard to believe... but I must face the truth.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Chaos has forsaken this place...”[%p]
Every last store that sold anime, eroge, or moe goods has disappeared from Akiba.[%p]
In a final desperate attempt to deny reality, I run to MayQueen+Nyan², the maid cafe where Mayuri and Faris work, and which Daru and I frequent.[%p]
But upon arriving at the storefront, I am forced to my knees in abject defeat.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s gone...”[%p]
It’s all gone.[%p]
It’s not just the moe stores. Even the maid cafes have disappeared.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri. You work at MayQueen, don’t you?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“MayQueen? What’s that? A potato?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“MayQueen+Nyan²!”[%p]
I ask Daru too, but no reaction.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii works at Lemoine, remember?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lemoine? Is that a maid cafe?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s just a normal coffee shop.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is there even a single maid cafe in Akiba?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Naw man. The people here hate moe businesses. Nobody would go.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
It’s clear now.[%p]
This has to be the result of Faris’s D-Mail.[%p]
The Butterfly Effect is at it again.[%p]
Faris said she had influence over Akiba’s development board. They adopted her plan and embraced the moe industry.[%p]
But by sending a D-Mail to 2000, the worldline has shifted to one where that never happened. Akiba is still electronics all the way.[%p]
To think that a single mail could rewrite ten years of a town’s history.[%p]
Is it okay to change history on a whim like this?[%p]
I almost feel guilty about it, but since I’m the only one who remembers the original Akiba, nobody can blame me.[%p]
And it’s not like I can change it back.[%p]
But still... what in the world did Faris’s D-Mail say?[%p]
