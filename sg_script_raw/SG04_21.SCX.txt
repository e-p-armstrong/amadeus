The next morning, I go for a stroll through the streets of Akiba.[%p]
What I discover is that, although the chaotic energy familiar to me has receded, Akiba is still Akiba at its core.[%p]
The few electronics stores that I used to frequent are still here. In fact, they’ve multiplied.[%p]
You can still hear their loud theme songs and the cries of salesmen all the way from the sidewalk.[%p]
Electronics otaku and PC maniacs walk the streets with unkempt hair, wrinkled clothes, and eyes burning with intense purpose.[%p]
There are even cheerful foreigners taking in the sights.[%p]
The maids and young female otaku have disappeared, but the hobbyist essence of the town is unchanged.[%p]
I admit it’s a relief.[%p]
Yesterday, I heard from Mayuri how we met Faris on this worldline. I was wondering, since MayQueen no longer exists.[%p]
It was at a small RaiNet tournament at a toy store in Ikebukuro. We went to cheer on Daru, but he dropped out because of a stomachache, so Mayuri and I ended up taking his place.[%p]
Our opponent was Faris.[%p]
We got crushed, needless to say, but Mayuri says that Faris was very gracious and gave us advice on how to play.[%p]
That was the beginning of their beautiful friendship.[%p]
Our past has changed considerably, yet we still ended up with the same close relationship we had on the last worldline. Fascinating. [%p]
Maybe Lady Luck is looking out for us.[%p]
I’ve got mail.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What the hell?”[%p]
Is this a prank? Spam?[%p]
Why red gelatin? Who’s watching me?[%p]
What’s going on here?[%p]
I spin around, searching the crowd. A few passers-by look at me strangely.[%p]
I don’t care. Something is wrong. Goosebumps break out over my body.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is it the Organization? SERN?”[%p]
[margin top="190"][margin left="48"]If so, then...[%e]
[margin top="38"][margin left="160"]This mail is a threat![%e]
[margin top="342"][margin left="320"]My pulse skyrockets.[%e]
[margin top="418"][margin left="64"]Oh shit oh shit oh shit![%e]
[margin top="304"][margin left="560"]What do I do?[%e]
[margin top="114"][margin left="448"]Do I tell someone?[%e]
[margin top="228"][margin left="384"]Who? I can’t involve anyone.[%e]
[margin top="152"][margin left="288"]It’s a prank. It has to be.[%e]
[margin top="380"][margin left="128"]Ignore it.[%e]
[margin top="76"][margin left="240"]But what if it’s serious?[%e]
[margin top="456"][margin left="320"]Are the men in black coming?[%e]
[margin top="190"][margin left="480"]I’m dead.[%e]
[margin top="494"][margin left="0"]They’ll erase me. Erase us.[%e]
[margin top="38"][margin left="192"]Should I call the police?[%e]
[margin top="266"][margin left="48"]No. Not enough evidence.[%e]
[margin top="228"][margin left="640"]What do I do?[%e]
[margin top="532"][margin left="720"]What do I do?[%e]
[margin top="190"][margin left="16"]What the hell do I--[%e]
Thoughts spin inside my head.[%p]
Every pedestrian looks like an enemy.[%p]
I flee from the crowd.[%p]
