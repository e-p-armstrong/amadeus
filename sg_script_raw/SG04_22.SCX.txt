After I manage to calm myself down, I head back to the lab.[%p]
For now, I’ll write that mail off as a prank.[%p]
It’s still early -- well, I guess it’s actually noon -- but Mayuri, Kurisu, and Lukako are already at the lab when I return.[%p]
I greet them, trying to keep the anxiety out of my voice.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s Sunday. [color index="820000"]Obon[color index="800000"] weekend. What are you doing here, lab girls?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Pardon the intrusion, Okabe-san.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Good morning, Okarin♪”[%p]
The two cute high school girls wave to me in greeting.[%p]
By the way, one of these girls is actually a boy.[%p]
In any case, the sight warms my heart -- or would, if not for a certain assistant who just gives me a bored look before going back to reading.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing?”[%p]
Mayuri and Lukako are sitting next to each other on the sofa, reading a book together.[%p]
It looks like a cosplay photo album.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yesterday I went to Nakano to buy doujinshi, remember? While I was there, I found a photo album of a super cute cosplayer!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So I splurged on it♪”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Look, Luka-chan! This is a costume of Sedona from [color index="820000"]Blood Tune[color index="800000"]. It’s so detailed and cute!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It is!”[%p]
I see. She’s showing it to Lukako as part of his “reeducation.”[%p]
To think that he was so reluctant to get involved in cosplay. Looks like Mayuri’s persistence has paid off.[%p]
Actually, judging by his obvious interest in the photo album, maybe he was always interested in cosplay -- just too shy to cosplay himself.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Take a look, Chris-chan! It’s amazing!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m okay.”[%p]
Looks like Kurisu’s not interested in the photo album.[%p]
She just gives a cold “hmph.”[%p]
Instead, she’s reading a difficult-looking English book.[%p]
Dammit, this is no time to be showing off your intelligence. You’re going to make Mayuri cry if you talk to her like that.[%p]
Or so I thought, but Mayuri doesn’t seem to mind, so I stay out of it.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow, look at these swimsuits! So much skin! She’s got a great figure, like a gravure idol.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Must be nice...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Nice? The swimsuits?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I... don’t have that great a figure...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Don’t worry, Luka-chan. I’m sure you’ll make our big friends breathe hard.”[%p]
Hey now, Mayuri. What are you saying? It’s like you’re referring to Daru with that remark.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And um, plenty of people like flat chests. So even if you don’t have breasts, you should still have confidence in yourself.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Khmmkhmmkhmm!”[%p]
Kurisu starts choking on her coffee.[%p]
I know how she feels. I almost did a spittake with my soda.[%p]
Mayuri’s breasts are huge for her height, so her advice lacks a certain element of persuasion.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I know! Once ComiMa’s over, let’s all go on a trip to the beach! Mayushii’s been making costumes all summer. I haven’t had time to play at all.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What do you think, guys? A lab mem beach trip!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... all of the lab mems?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I can’t go. I have to go back to America soon, and I haven’t even started packing yet.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes, I can see you’re in a rush. I bet you don’t even have time to lounge around and read.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu snaps her book shut and glares at me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Fine, I’ll be blunt. There’s no way I’m swimming with two perverts like you!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If it’s just the girl members, I’ll happily go.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph. Be honest, Christina. You just don’t want me to see the [color index="820000"]Mongolian Spot[color index="800000"] on your butt!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t have a Mongolian Spot!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, if it’s just the girl members, then doesn’t that rule out Lukako?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What’s that supposed to mean?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]”Didn’t we tell you earlier? Lukako is a bonafide guy!” [%p]
My declaration of the truth...[%p]
Freezes the air instantly.[%p]
...Huh?[%p]
There’s something off about their reaction.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re the worst. Where do you get off calling her a guy?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah, Okarin. That’s a terrible thing to say.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
Even Mayuri condemns me.[%p]
Lukako, meanwhile, turns pale and hangs his head so I can’t see his face.[%p]
Is he... crying?[%p]
Normally, he’d get depressed and say something about how embarrassed he’d be to wear a swimsuit, but he wouldn’t start crying...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina. I understand your desire to deny the truth. It’s difficult to imagine that a guy could ever be so cute, but--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe!”[%p]
Kurisu’s advances on me with a stern glare.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you want to give me stupid nicknames, that’s fine -- I mean, it’s not, but...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What you said just now is below the belt.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I didn’t take you for the kind of guy who thinks it’s funny to hurt people’s feelings, but I guess I was wrong. You’re a real jerk, Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
What did I do to deserve this tongue-lashing?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Apologize. Apologize to Urushibara-san right now.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait a second. I don’t have to apologize for anything. I just said the tru--”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It’s okay.”[%p]
Lukako gets up from the sofa. His head is still hanging, and his voice is barely audible.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“So that’s how Okabe-san sees me...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No no no! That’s not how I [color index="A0140000"]see[color index="800000"] you, Lukako. You’re a guy, remember!? Or are you denying reality too!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re the one denying reality!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s right! Luka-chan’s a girl, Okarin. You’re terrible.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, when did you start calling Lukako ’Luka-chan’ instead of ’Luka-kun’?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Cut it out already, Okabe! She’s a girl!”[%p]
Mayuri nods in agreement.[%p]
Uh... huh?[%p]
What’s going on here?[%p]
Is this some kind of prank?[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m going home!”[%p]
Lukako tries to slip by me out of the lab.[%p]
I grab his hand to stop him from leaving.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hold it, Lukako! You can’t fool me! You’re as much a man as I am! And I know how to prove it!”[%p]
I pin Lukako’s arms and reach for his package.[%p]
Let’s see what you’re hiding... down...[%p]
Nothing.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh...?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“ah...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Awawa...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ohhhh? Huh? What? Why?”[%p]
I feel around some more.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ugh, no, don’t... Okabe-san, please... stop... sniff.”[%p]
Nothing. Nada.[%p]
It should be there.[%p]
I mean, he’s a guy... isn’t he?[%p]
An electric current runs through my brain.[%p]
No way...[%p]
Yes way.[%p]
So that’s what happened![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako, you...”[%p]
The D-Mail that I thought had failed...[%p]
Was actually a success![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re a girl!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s what we’ve been saying!”[%p]
A half-second later, Kurisu cracks me over the head with her heavy textbook.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“hic... ugg... egh...”[%p]
When my vision clears, Lukako is crying.[%p]
Mayuri is rubbing her back comfortingly.[%p]
Kurisu, meanwhile, is glaring down at me like I’m something she scraped off the bottom of her shoe.[%p]
Daru, who arrived a moment ago, is in the corner, trying not to laugh.[%p]
Honestly, I can’t blame him. [%p]
“Righteous High School Girl Makes Perverted College Guy Beg for Forgiveness”[%p]
If I had to put a title to this scene, that’s what it would be.[%p]
The top of my head is throbbing.[%p]
Most likely because Kurisu wiped out a hundred million of my precious neurons, envied by scientists the world over.[%p]
I put a moist towel to my head.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I want to vivisect your skull and remove your brain for a good washing.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then I’ll submerge it in culture fluid so you can never do anything like that again!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, just be thankful I haven’t reported you to the police.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes ma’am. I’m sorry.”[%p]
Man, that was dumb.[%p]
I didn’t think it would be [color index="A0140000"]gone[color index="800000"].[%p]
Lukako has become a girl.[%p]
Her face hasn’t changed, and she’s flat as a board, but she’s definitely a girl.[%p]
There’s no denying what my hand didn’t feel.[%p]
I guess that ridiculous superstition was true. If you eat vegetables, you’ll have a girl. Does this count as a scientific breakthrough?[%p]
Anyway, I’d better apologize to Lukako.[%p]
I hope she doesn’t get [color index="820000"]PTSD[color index="800000"] because some pervert (me) groped her. I mean, she’s a 17-year-old girl now, and she was shy to begin with.[%p]
I’ll need to be as gentle as humanly possible from now on.[%p]
Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if she never spoke to me again.[%p]
I have no one but myself to blame. I’ll just have to accept the consequences.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, what in the hell made you think that Urushibara-san was a boy?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh... as I already explained, we changed the past. Lukako was a guy, but he wanted to be a girl, so we sent a D-Mail to make his wish come true. And it worked!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I [color index="A0140000"]knew[color index="800000"] the worldline had changed. My magic eye, Reading Steiner, saw the shift in time.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I chose to believe my mundane senses instead. I should have had more faith in my powers! I won’t make that mistake again.”[%p]
Kurisu calmly readies her book above her head.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Want some more?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m telling the truth. You have to believe me!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can explain this phenomenon logically. When we sent the D-Mail, we changed the past, and all of history changed as a result. My brain perceived that change!”[%p]
I leap to my feet, overcome with excitement.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Out of all mankind, I alone can perceive changes in causality! I am this world’s observer!”[%p]
I look around, expecting to see awe on their faces.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sit down before I hit you again.”[%p]
I do as I’m told.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t you understand? I’m the observer, the one who opens the box holding [color index="820000"]Schrodinger’s cat[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Shredding Gar?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Schrodinger’s cat again?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The Japanese can’t get enough of that cat.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re Japanese too.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ve had enough Schrodinger, thanks. I do admit that [color index="820000"]kittehs[color index="800000"] are cute, though.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gh...”[%p]
Daru’s absolutely right. Whenever an anime wants to use quantum mechanics, the characters always talk about Schrodinger’s Cat.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, my magic eye has the power to perceive changes in the worldline. This power is called Reading Steiner, as I’ve explained.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And I told you that that name was stupid, remember?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s Engrish, like something from a kid’s manga.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Not to mention it’s a grammatical mess, and there’s also the fact that it’s half German, so no consistency there either. It’s stupid.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The same goes for that ’Steins Gate’ thing you’re always talking about.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh... looks like you’ve still got that Mongolian Spot on your butt. Eh, Christina?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Names are all about feeling! My creativity, comparable to the great Da Vinci himself, cannot be held by the shackles of grammar! Muhah--”[%p]
She hits me again.[%p]
I’m seeing stars.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Show a little remorse, huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry...”[%p]
Lukako is still crying.[%p]
