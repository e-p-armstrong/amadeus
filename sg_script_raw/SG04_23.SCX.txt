As punishment, I spend the next thirty minutes on my knees under Kurisu’s watchful eye.[%p]
If I slouch for a second, I get the corner of her book.[%p]
I’d accept being told “Die, Pervert” if it were coming from Lukako. But why the hell is Kurisu butting in? I didn’t do anything to [color index="A0140000"]her[color index="800000"].[%p]
Does she think she’s one of those class president characters?[%p]
Anyway, I flee the lab as soon as my punishment is over. The silent pressure from the girls is just too much to bear.[%p]
I step into the sun and stretch. My legs are numb from the kneeling, so I can barely stand straight.[%p]
At that moment, the Braun Tube Workshop door opens, and out comes Part-Time Warrior.[%p]
Our eyes meet.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Sup.”[%p]
She’s less energetic than usual.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Why are you so wobbly?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s... a new exercise.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh. Never heard of it.”[%p]
Suzuha answers listlessly as she sits down on the bench.[%p]
When she aimlessly gazes skyward, I follow suit.[%p]
Huge clouds are slowly swallowing the blue.[%p]
A helicopter flies overhead. I can hear its propellers slicing the air.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Perfect weather for cycling.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Really?”[%p]
But it’s so damn hot. How can you exercise on a day like this?[%p]
I’d rather drink hot coffee in a well air-conditioned room while browsing the net.[%p]
Now that’s a luxurious way to spend summer break.[%p]
If only the lab had air conditioning.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hey, up for a little cycling?”[%p]
Seriously?[%p]
She has to be joking.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your bike only has one seat.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“One of us can sit on the back.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t you have work to do?”[%p]
Suzuha pops into the store. She’s back in less than a minute.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I got permission. It’s not like we’ll have customers anyway.”[%p]
I try to think of an excuse to refuse, but nothing comes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huff... huff... I am a mad scientist... not a mad... cyclist...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huff... huff... so why... am I... doing the pedaling?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Long ago, Aristotle said, ’time is just the measure of motion.’”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So put those pedals in motion.”[%p]
That doesn’t make sense...[%p]
I’m exhausted.[%p]
We barely made it to the station. I’d die if I went another block.[%p]
This was a terrible idea. I should have known better.[%p]
I get off the bicycle and sit against the station wall.[%p]
Suzuha sets the bike against the wall and crouches next to me.[%p]
Sitting on the ground is undignified for a man of my stature, but no matter. I just need a few moments to catch my breath.[%p]
I watch the crowds of people move past. Nearly all of them are men.[%p]
Here and there, I see people carrying large boxes, most likely PC parts or appliances. There isn’t an anime poster in sight.[%p]
When Akiba changed, so did the people who visited it.[%p]
This atmosphere...[%p]
It’s kind of... retro.[%p]
It’s the Akiba I’ve only seen in pictures. Akiba at the end of the 20th century.[%p]
The Electric Town in its purest form.[%p]
It has risen from the ashes of the past.[%p]
And the only one who knows it... is me.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You know...”[%p]
Suzuha murmurs.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s only been ten days since I arrived in Tokyo.”[%p]
Huh. I didn’t know that.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Vacation? No... that can’t be right.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m hunting for my father.”[%p]
That’s a strange way to put it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did he run away?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
I meant it as a joke, but Suzuha looks so serious. I hope I didn’t screw up again.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I haven’t seen him in years. But I know he’s in this town.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh... but then why are you working downstairs?”[%p]
Suzuha works at the Braun Tube Workshop from 11 AM to 7 PM every day.[%p]
I doubt that leaves much time to search.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Honestly, I don’t have a clue where to begin.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you talked to the police?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...No.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then shouldn’t you? Or you could hire a private investigator or something, if you have money.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I don’t have the resources. And besides, there are... issues.”[%p]
Issues...[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I only have one chance.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And that chance is tomorrow.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I know that tomorrow, he might appear in a certain place.”[%p]
A certain place?[%p]
That has a rather ominous ring to it.[%p]
Could her father be some kind of fugitive?[%p]
I stay silent, unable to think of a response.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If I miss that chance, then I’ll have to leave.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By leave, you mean go back home?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Not exactly. I have a parallel, priority engagement.”[%p]
What?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ve already made up my mind. I don’t find him tomorrow, I’ll give up.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re worried, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I understand that feeling. You’re alone, searching for your father in an unfamiliar town. It can’t be easy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You hoped that talking to someone would help. That’s why you sought out the most reliable person around -- me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alas, Part-Time Warrior, you have made a grave mistake. For I am the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uh...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh... you shall be my next guinea pig!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Guinea pig?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You know what I’m talking about. D-Mail, the greatest discovery in the history of science!”[%p]
I’ve already explained D-Mail to Suzuha before.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You shall be the subject of our next experiment. Heh heh heh.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Wh-what are you gonna do?”[%p]
Suzuha takes a step back. She finally realizes the danger she’s in.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do? Simple. I need more data, and I’ll do anything to obtain it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re going to change the past. You can change it however you like, but only I will know the difference!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you think that’s cruel, then do as you please. But know that you are already caught in my web. You cannot escape.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Fear not! I know exactly what you should write in your D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh... listen well. You’re going to send this to your father before he disappeared.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“’Don’t abandon your daughter.’ Muhahahaha!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...You’re a nice guy. You know that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wh...at?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I think talking to you really did help.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you trying to insult me? I am not a [color index="A0140000"]nice guy[color index="800000"]. I am a mad scientist who experiments on women and children!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now tell me your father’s email address! If you don’t...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then I shall unleash the power of my right arm! Once it’s unsealed, not even I can control it. You may not survive. Consider yourself warned.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Sorry. I can’t.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You dare defy me!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I don’t know his email address or his phone number.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Oh.”[%p]
Well, that’s a letdown.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s why tomorrow’s my only chance. Thanks for caring, though.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t care. I’m just disappointed I couldn’t experiment on you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Anyway, you can send mail to the past? That’s amazing! The first time machine ever!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph, of course it’s amazing. I am Hououin Kyouma!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Any plans to upgrade it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Upgrade it?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You know, like sending people to the past or something.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’re working on it.”[%p]
No good ideas yet, though.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Then let me give you one word of advice.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You should leave Makise Kurisu out of it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you have against her, anyway?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Welp. Better get back to the workshop.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I only got a 30-minute break. I’ll get in trouble if I don’t get back soon.”[%p]
I stop Suzuha as she gets on the bike.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Come to the lab tomorrow, whether you meet your father or not.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Why?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So I can use your grief to power my time machine. Heh heh heh!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ahaha! You really are a mad scientist. So eeeevil!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If I meet my father, I’ll stop by. Then we can do a gun salute!”[%p]
She laughs happily.[%p]
Then she starts pedaling...[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]...leaving me behind.[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, wait! Let me on! Hey!”[%p]
Suzuha doesn’t wait, leaving me with no choice but to run back to the lab.[%p]
