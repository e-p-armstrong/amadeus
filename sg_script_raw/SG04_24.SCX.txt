[name]Rintaro[line]“I shall now brief you on Operation [color index="820000"]Eldhrimnir[color index="800000"].”[%p]
The only lab mems here today are Mayuri, Kurisu, and Lukako.[%p]
I couldn’t get ahold of Faris or Moeka. They must be busy.[%p]
Daru, meanwhile, gave me some crap about having things to do.[%p]
I was prepared for Lukako to refuse my invitation, but since she’s here, I guess she’s forgiven me -- for now, at least.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I want you guys to get ready for a party.”[%p]
I’ve already explained to the lab mems what Suzuha told me yesterday.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And what are you going to do?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Me? I’m going to follow that Part-Time Warrior and report back as the situation changes.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t you dare. Let her be alone with her father.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh. You shouldn’t be so quick to reject my plans, Christina. You don’t understand the intricacies of the human psyche.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now that you’ve rejected my plan, there’s no [color index="A0140000"]way[color index="800000"] I’m not going through with it! You have underestimated my pride!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Get over yourself.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Besides, Christina, you and she are enemies, are you not? You protect her from me while plotting her demise? That makes you a hypocrite!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You just don’t have standards, that’s all.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“She’s right. I don’t think you should bother her, Okarin.”[%p]
Even during the strategy meeting, Mayuri keeps working on her costume.[%p]
Lukako hasn’t agreed to wear it yet, but Mayuri’s enthusiasm remains strong.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“No matter what happens, we need to give her a waaaarm welcome. I’ll do anything to help make this party super special.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um, actually, I haven’t met this Suzuha-san...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Suzu-san’s really nice. I’m sure you’ll get along with her too!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Nice?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, I’m going to tail her now. You guys--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No! Get it through your thick skull!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Dammit, assistant! How dare you give me orders!?”[%p]
In the end, I can’t get permission to tail Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t even think about running off somewhere.”[%p]
Kurisu is forcing me to help her with the shopping. There’s no way out.[%p]
Dammit...[%p]
Kurisu really is turning into a class president character.[%p]
At this rate, she might take over the lab.[%p]
Wait. Could this be what Suzuha was warning me about?[%p]
...Nah.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway...”[%p]
Kurisu scratches her cheek in what could be taken for a bashful gesture.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I hope Amane-san finds her father.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That would be... nice.”[%p]
Come to think of it, she has father issues too, doesn’t she?[%p]
Maybe she sympathizes with Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, Okabe...”[%p]
Suddenly, Kurisu starts fidgeting for some reason.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m sorry about before.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Before?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“When I hit you with my book. I thought you were just being a pervert.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But when I thought about it later, I realized that you were being completely serious.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But I acted on impulse, without even considering what you had to say.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Forget it. Regardless of my intentions, the fact of the matter is that I made Lukako cry.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Just to make sure, you’re not a perverted scumbag, are you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Make sure, my ass! Are you trying to apologize or what!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I just don’t want to you to use science as an excuse to be a pervert. Not while I’m helping, at least.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you take me for?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“My friends are precious to me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I may be an insane mad scientist with an IQ of 170, but even I have my limits.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The PhoneWave (name subject to change) wouldn’t have come this far without you and Daru at my side.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am Lab Mem 001, the founder of the lab.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If my friends are in danger, I’ll rush to their aid. And I would tear my own limbs off before I knowingly brought harm to any of you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Pff...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s so funny?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That has to be the cheesiest thing you’ve ever said.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Still, it’s nice to hear.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The research institute I work at in America is full of talented people from all over the world... but it’s not a friendly place.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Everyone thinks he or she is the best. You think [color index="A0140000"]you[color index="800000"] have an ego? Over there, scientists hurl insults at each other on a daily basis. Sometimes they even sabotage each other’s work.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“When my thesis was chosen to represent the lab, many of the older men complained.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And when I came back here as a kind of reverse exchange student, my classmates were all too afraid to talk to me.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Compared to that, your lab is childish... but comfortable.”[%p]
...Seems like everyone has their own problems.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re really concerned about Amane-san, aren’t you? That part of you, I can respect.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“B-but I’m not praising you, okay?”[%p]
She suddenly blushes for some reason.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I just... you know... thought you should know...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe I...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe all I ever wanted was friends.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There aren’t many people I can trust...”[%p]
After all, I am an insane mad scientist wanted the world over. My enemies are everywhere waiting to strike![%p]
Curse this incredible genius brain of mine! Muhahaha![%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I, um... think of you as a friend too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You said I was your friend, remember? You said I was important to you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That made me really... happy, I guess.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you have a fever?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What the hell!? Here I am trying to find something decent about you, and you... I don’t care anymore, stupid!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re really... stupid.”[%p]
Kurisu squares her shoulders and quickly walks ahead. I give chase.[%p]
What just happened?[%p]
Is this girl planning something?[%p]
Maybe she really is plotting to take over the lab.[%p]
No, wait. Maybe she’s trying to sabotage the party because she doesn’t like Suzuha.[%p]
Hmph. No mere assistant is going to pull one over on the great Hououin Kyouma![%p]
Anyway, time to get my head in the game.[%p]
We must prepare for the Last Supper, Operation Eldhrimnir.[%p]
The “Last Supper” refers to our party for Suzuha.[%p]
In the event she reunites with her father, we’ll just celebrate normally. In other words, it will be her last supper in Tokyo.[%p]
However...[%p]
If she doesn’t reunite with her father, we’ll kidnap her and force her to participate in our experiments.[%p]
Sacrifices must be made if we’re going to perfect D-Mail technology.[%p]
In that case, it will be the “last supper” on this worldline.[%p]
The lab’s budget -- most of which comes out of my pocket -- is tight, but it’s okay to party every once in a while.[%p]
There’s no such thing as low-risk, high-return.[%p]
High-risk, high-return. That is how a mad scientist operates.[%p]
Muhaha, I can already taste Suzuha’s despair![%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Huh? Over there, isn’t that...”[%p]
I follow Kurisu’s finger to see Daru emerge from Yodobashi Camera.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Found you, Daru!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? Ah--”[%p]
I grab his collar to stop him from escaping.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why didn’t you respond to my summons?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Like I said, I’ve got something to do.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Which is?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“An offline meet...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Inexcusable.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, just listen a sec--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your offline meet, or a party with food handmade by our very own lab girls. Choose one.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Handmade... by girls?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“O-one question. Will Faris-tan be there?”[%p]
Before Kurisu can answer that, I whisper to Daru.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Naturally. Faris is a lab mem too. Heh heh heh.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Dammit! Why do they have to be on the same day!? Can’t it wait until tomorrow?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What will it be? The time to choose is now.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I want to eat Faris-tan’s home cooking...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you give up the offline meet, then that settles it.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I give up. I give up the offline meeeet!”[%p]
Daru surrenders all too quickly.[%p]
When we return to the lab, Mayuri and Lukako are already starting preparations.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh? Daru-kun’s here too?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What about Faris-tan? Where is she?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’ve been tricked.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Feris-chan said she couldn’t come.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, seriously!? Okarin! What’s going on here!? This isn’t funny, man!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry. I’ll make sure she comes to the next one.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’ve gotta be kidding me! I was looking forward to that time machine meet...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Time machine meet? What’s that?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s an offline meet for this sci-fi BBS I post on.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Some famous writers are going to be there. I won’t forgive you, Okarin. Ever.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? Why didn’t you say so? I would’ve gone too!”[%p]
Suddenly, I smell something strange.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Does anyone else smell that?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Smell what?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did we blow a fuse somewhere?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“S-sorry...”[%p]
Lukako’s apologizing for something.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“That’s probably the smell of... Mayuri’s cooking...”[%p]
...What?[%p]
This is the smell of [color index="A0140000"]food[color index="800000"]!?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ll help too.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okay, then warm these eggs please.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hm. Should I use the PhoneWave?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“N-no! If you put raw eggs in a microwave, they’ll explode!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We took the door off. It should be fine, right?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Chop, chop, choppity chop, chop, chop, choppity...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“M-Mayuri-chan! Don’t hold your knife like that!”[%p]
What the hell is going on here?[%p]
Daru and I exchange glances.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe we should help too. Or at least kick them out of the kitchen?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Won’t it end up the same either way?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m getting dizzy. This isn’t the future I was hoping for.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’re telling me. I’ll never forget this, Okarin. Never.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry. Truly. But please, Daru, stay with me to the end.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ll order pizza as insurance.”[%p]
It only gets worse.[%p]
The smoke grows thicker by the second, filling my lungs with ash and tar.[%p]
In less than an hour, the girls have transformed the lab into a class five disaster zone![%p]
I take out my phone and put it to my ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. Looks like the Evil One is free. If you haven’t heard from me in an hour... tell my parents I love them.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin, that’s a [color index="820000"]death flag[color index="800000"]...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is this the choice of Steins Gate? El Psy Kongroo...”[%p]
