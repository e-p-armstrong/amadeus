After the storm has passed...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hwahhhh...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...She’s late.”[%p]
The sun has already set.[%p]
The food lined up on the table -- none of it looking particularly appetizing -- has already grown cold.[%p]
I open my phone to check the time.[%p]
It’s getting late. The high school girls will need to head back soon.[%p]
Was Suzuha able to meet her father?[%p]
If so, they might have a lot to talk about.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
There’s only one word in Suzuha’s email.[%p]
Does that mean she didn’t meet her father!?[%p]
And now she plans to leave town alone!?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hououin Kyouma will never accept that! She will be my guinea pig whether she likes it or not!”[%p]
I fly out of the lab.[%p]
I don’t know where Suzuha is.[%p]
All I can do for now is go to the station.[%p]
If she’s going to leave town, she should be using public transportation.[%p]
If she’s using the Hibiya Line on the other side of the station, then I’ve struck out.[%p]
But if she’s going to take the bullet train from Tokyo or Ueno, then she’ll have to pass through here.[%p]
I carefully scan the thinning crowd around Akiba Station.[%p]
Where is she?[%p]
After about thirty minutes of watching the crowd, I spot something.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
My gaze focuses on a person walking in from the main street.[%p]
It’s Suzuha, shuffling along with her head bowed.[%p]
As she gets closer, I can see that she’s wiping her eyes.[%p]
Is she crying?[%p]
I don’t see anyone walking with her.[%p]
I guess she couldn’t find her father after all.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You there! Part-Time Warrior!”[%p]
Suzuha looks up in surprise.[%p]
I see the tracks of tears on her face.[%p]
Just as our eyes are about to meet, Suzuha looks away.[%p]
And then she turns and runs out of the station.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait!”[%p]
I give chase, ignoring the stares of passers-by.[%p]
...She’s gone.[%p]
Dammit![%p]
Where did she...[%p]
Hold on a second.[%p]
Why am I chasing her?[%p]
Do I have some kind of urge to chase things that run away?[%p]
That’s stupid. I’m not a dog![%p]
Shouldn’t I just leave her be?[%p]
It’s not like we’re that close, right?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...You’re a nice guy. You know that?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I think talking to you really did help.”[%p]
But Suzuha is all alone in this town.[%p]
What if I was the only one she could talk to about her father?[%p]
I know she’s hurting.[%p]
She needs my help.[%p]
Shouldn’t I do everything in my power?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!?”[%p]
Just now, I think I saw someone who looked like Suzuha.[%p]
But the run from the station has left me exhausted. I drop to my knees, gasping for breath.[%p]
My sides ache. I can’t take another step.[%p]
Even after searching the entire area around the station, I couldn’t find Suzuha.[%p]
I guess this, too, is the choice of Steins Gate.[%p]
As I rest, I look up at the night sky. The satellite remains buried in Radi-Kan’s wall.[%p]
I wipe the sweat off my brow and head back to the lab.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin! Did you find Suzu-san?”[%p]
Everyone’s still there when I return.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s late. Go home, everyone.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“But...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Tell us what happened.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah. Keep us in the loop, man.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha ran away from me. I guess she couldn’t find her father.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh...”[%p]
A gloomy silence falls.[%p]
I can see the sadness on everyone’s face.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh... heh heh heh...”[%p]
I begin to laugh.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“MUHAHAHAHA!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“O-Okabe-san? What’s wrong? Are you okay?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“His brain is probably oxygen-starved from too much running.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin... chill.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh, look at you all!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why the long faces, friends!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you forgotten? We have just the thing for moments like these!”[%p]
I thrust my finger at the curtain to the development room.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re going to send a D-Mail?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But the discharge phenomenon won’t occur this late, will it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then we’ll send it tomorrow.”[%p]
D-Mails leap through time. It matters not when we send it, but when it is received.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Who are you sending it to?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“To myself this afternoon. The message...”[%p]
I smile triumphantly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t listen to Christina. Pursue Suzuha!’”[%p]
If I do that, there’s no way I can fail.[%p]
And then, we can have Suzuha as a test subject![%p]
I suddenly hear the sound of rain.[%p]
I look outside the window and see that rain has started to fall.[%p]
As Daru predicted, the discharge phenomenon does not occur. It looks like we’ll have to wait until tomorrow.[%p]
The rain grows stronger over time, eventually becoming a thunderstorm.[%p]
The next day, there isn’t a cloud in the sky.[%p]
It’s hard to believe it rained all night.[%p]
I keep checking the Braun Tube Workshop through the window, but the morning passes without any sign of Suzuha.[%p]
She’s probably long gone from Akiba by now.[%p]
Heh heh heh... she doesn’t know who she’s dealing with.[%p]
She is but a pawn in my game, destined to fight for me at Ragnarok.[%p]
At the stroke of noon, I activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
The destination is my phone, yesterday around 4 PM.[%p]
The discharge phenomenon occurs as normal.[%p]
The floor shakes violently.[%p]
Squinting against the glare, I send the mail.[%p]
My brain shakes violently. My vision flickers.[%p]
As the vertigo passes, I can hear my heartbeat and feel the warm blood coursing through my body.[%p]
I blink slowly.[%p]
That was the sensation of Reading Steiner activating.[%p]
And so I know. Suzuha is ours.[%p]
I hurry down the stairs.[%p]
I step outside and look to the front of the building.[%p]
What belongs there has returned.[%p]
A mountain bike polished to a shining finish.[%p]
And on the bench next to it, looking up into the summer sky, is...[%p]
Amane Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Good morning, Part-Time Warrior.”[%p]
I try to remain calm as I call out to her.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Sup.”[%p]
She greets me in her usual listless fashion.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Slacking off?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s not like anyone’s gonna come.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And besides, I was up all night partying.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m really tired.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You were partying? With who?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Were you drinking, Okabe Rintaro?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Big no-no. You’re only eighteen.”[%p]
We have shifted from a worldline where we failed to stop Suzuha from leaving to one where we succeeded. As a result, the events of yesterday changed.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You couldn’t find your father, so we held the ’Last Supper’ to make you a test subject. Correct?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ahaha! Yeah, I remember you saying something like that.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Thanks for all your help yesterday.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...My memory’s a bit fuzzy. Remind me again how we captured you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Wait, were you really drinking last night?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just tell me.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Well, I was on my way home from the time machine meet when--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Woah, wait a second. Time machine meet!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yup.”[%p]
That’s the same offline meet that Daru was going to...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Was that where your father was supposed to appear?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I said so yesterday, didn’t I?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So you were going home, and then?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You, Hashida Itaru, and Shiina Mayuri appeared out of nowhere.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You brought me to the lab, and we partied all night long.”[%p]
So my pursuit of Suzuha was a resounding success.[%p]
I can’t help but smile at how smoothly things went.[%p]
Suzuha, meanwhile, looks back up at the clear blue sky.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yesterday sure was fun...”[%p]
Her tone is sincere.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It would’ve been more fun if not for Makise Kurisu. The apple pie she made was deadly.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But Urushibara Luka’s curry was awesome.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Your lab seems kinda like... umm... like a clubhouse? It’s nice.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Everyone gets along, and you’re always smiling...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ve never had so much fun in my life.”[%p]
Hmm. It sounds like Suzuha had a pretty dark childhood.[%p]
Maybe she was bullied in school.[%p]
Could that be related to her father’s disappearance?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Part-Time Warrior. As promised, you are now my test subject.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But I already told you. I don’t know his email address.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then we’ll have to postpone the experiment until you find out.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By the way, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) used in the experiment is our lab’s greatest secret. You must become a lab mem to guarantee your silence.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Lab mem?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Short for laboratory member. When you become a lab mem, you become one of us.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Can I really join?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You don’t have a choice in the matter! From this day forth, you are Lab Mem 008!”[%p]
Suzuha lowers her head, no doubt awed by my proclamation.[%p]
I hear what sounds like a sniffle.[%p]
Then she looks up, revealing a smile.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I guess I don’t have a choice, huh? I’m all yours.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...You’re not going to leave?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Nope. Maybe there’s still a chance to find my dad.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You are a lab mem now. If there’s anything we can do, you need only ask.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By the way, do you have any leads?”[%p]
Suzuha hesitates a little.[%p]
Then she stands up and turns to me.[%p]
Her expression is grave.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“My father calls himself Titor.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait, Titor? As in [color index="A0140000"]that[color index="800000"] Titor!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You know about him? He might be using a different codename, though.”[%p]
I don’t just know about him. He’s been active on @channel for the past several weeks![%p]
I open the @channel thread on my phone and show it to Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Look! There’s someone posting named John Titor!”[%p]
Suzuha stares at the screen.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This solves the puzzle! Your father is on @channel!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh... you’re right.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey. Shouldn’t you be more surprised?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Well... it’s not him.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How do you know? You just said your father calls himself Titor!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I can tell. This Titor isn’t my dad.”[%p]
That’s a strange way to put it.[%p]
It’s almost like she knows who’s behind John Titor.[%p]
As if to answer my suspicions, Suzuha continues.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“His name’s not John. The name my father used was...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Barrel Titor.”[%p]
