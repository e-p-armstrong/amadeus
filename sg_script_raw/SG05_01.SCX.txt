I open my eyes to a deep scarlet sky.[%p]
I’m on my back, lying face up.[%p]
The sky is vast, and the color ominous. I’ve never seen it like this before.[%p]
Where am I?[%p]
I sit up.[%p]
There is nothing here.[%p]
A wasteland stretches to the horizon, nothing but rocks and dust as far as the eye can see.[%p]
No plants. No water.[%p]
No sun. No moon.[%p]
No warmth. No cold.[%p]
Not a single breath of wind.[%p]
It looks like hell.[%p]
A frozen world.[%p]
It can’t be Earth.[%p]
Mars, I could believe.[%p]
Why am I here?[%p]
This must be a dream.[%p]
I give up thinking about it and lie down again on the sand.[%p]
I guess I’ll wake up soon.[%p]
I should just wait until then.[%p]
I wait... but the dream shows no sign of ending.[%p]
Have I ever had a dream this lucid before?[%p]
There’s a terrible ringing in my ears that keeps me awake.[%p]
I realize that it’s the sound of silence.[%p]
My belongings are gone. I have no watch, no phone.[%p]
The lack of motion numbs my sense of time.[%p]
How long have I been lying here?[%p]
It might have been only a second.[%p]
It might have been three days.[%p]
An epiphany.[%p]
The concept of time is a human construct.[%p]
The universe at large has no use for it.[%p]
Time is a cage that we created to feel secure. Within its walls, we can forget our own insignificance.[%p]
I’m thirsty.[%p]
It hurts to breathe.[%p]
This void is no place for a human.[%p]
We’re not strong enough to live in a world without time.[%p]
Tears fill my eyes.[%p]
What do they mean? I no longer know.[%p]
I want to die.[%p]
Yes, let’s die.[%p]
But what is death?[%p]
To be frozen in time?[%p]
Time stopped for me long ago.[%p]
How can I die in a world that is already dead?[%p]
Everything inside me is crumbling away.[%p]
Who am I?[%p]
I can barely recall.[%p]
My soul is melting into the void.[%p]
Is someone there?[%p]
Anyone?[%p]
Something moves in the corner of my eye.[%p]
Impossible.[%p]
I try to move my eyes, but I’ve forgotten how.[%p]
[margin top="266"][center]Found you, Okarin♪[%e]
A pleasant voice silences the buzzing in my ears.[%p]
It reminds me who I am. Okabe Rintaro.[%p]
This time, my eyes move.[%p]
There’s a girl sitting on a nearby rock.[%p]
I recognize her.[%p]
My frozen brain comes alive.[%p]
Her presence breathes new life into this dead world.[%p]
Mayuri?[%p]
My brain is still half asleep, and I cannot speak.[%p]
It’s Mayuri. Shiina Mayuri. My oldest friend.[%p]
She smiles at me, swinging her legs.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“This is the Earth, you know? 70 million years ago.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Some scary people sent you here in a time machine.”[%p]
This is a dream, right?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii went looking for you, and found Okarins from many, maaaany worldlines.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’re one of many Okarins, and also the original.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii is one of many Mayushiis, and also the original.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And now, Okarin and Mayushii are going to die here.”[%p]
This is a dream... right, Mayuri?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I know that another Okarin and Mayushii will pick up where we left off, 70 million years in the future.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So everything’s A-OK♪”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This... is a dream!”[%p]
