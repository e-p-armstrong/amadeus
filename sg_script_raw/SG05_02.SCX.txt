[name]Rintaro[line]“Guh!”[%p]
I jerk awake on top of the sofa.[%p]
My body is drenched in sweat.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...It was a dream.”[%p]
I must have fallen asleep some time around noon.[%p]
What a horrible nightmare.[%p]
I guess that threatening email I got is still weighing on my mind.[%p]
Still, Mayuri had to save me? Even in a dream, that’s unacceptable.[%p]
I’m the one who saves her.[%p]
That’s the way it should be.[%p]
Besides, Mayuri’s not smart enough to talk about time travel like that. [%p]
I sit up and look around the room.[%p]
She’s right where I expect to find her.[%p]
In front of the TV, watching a RaiNet Kakeru DVD.[%p]
On the screen, the Upa riding Kakeru’s shoulder is screaming something unintelligible.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I wish I had an Upa...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Look at her sitting there all spaced out. Mayuri [color index="A0140000"]needs[color index="800000"] my protection.[%p]
That dream was wrong.[%p]
I chug a Dr P and check my phone.[%p]
No new emails.[%p]
I sent Titor a mail several hours ago, just to make sure that he really isn’t Suzuha’s father. He hasn’t replied yet.[%p]
Obviously, Daru and the others don’t know that I changed the past.[%p]
Instead, they remember partying with Suzuha all night long. It was strange listening to them talk happily about an event I attended, but do not remember.[%p]
...Wait, is that my phone ringing?[%p]
Ugh...[%p]
One look at the name makes me want to groan.[%p]
It’s Faris.[%p]
I’ve said it a thousand times, but I’m just not good with that catgirl.[%p]
She always ties me into knots.[%p]
My instincts tell me not to pick up.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is Hououin Kyouma.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“Nyaon♪ It’s Faris, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, it’s you, Akiha Rumiho.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“Nya? Who’s that, nya?”[%p]
Hm? I could’ve sworn her real name was Akiha Rumiho.[%p]
Don’t tell me... Could the D-Mail have changed that too?[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“Faris is Faris, nya. I don’t have any other names, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, right. Your True Name is Faris. My apologies.”[%p]
Of course. She’s just being her usual self.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, what is it?”[%p]
If Faris is calling me, it might be about the IBN 5100. She did promise to help us find one.[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“You’ve been too conspicuous, nya. The cat’s outta the bag, and now you’re trapped, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hah?”[%p]
More of Faris’s usual nonsense?[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“The Four Guardian Kings have awakened, nya. There’s no escape, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh. Is that so? If you think the Four Guardian Kings can stop me, just wait and see. Akiba will be drowning in blood before nightfall.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“After the Four Guardian Kings are the Four Guardian Queens, nya. After that, it’s the Eight Devils, and then the Black Angel Twelve, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Th-that many!? What’s going on in this town...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“You’ve really stirred up a hornet’s nest, nya. I’m sorry, Kyouma, but this is checkmate, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, it’s not over yet. If I can just acquire [color index="A0140000"]the item[color index="800000"], I can turn the tide!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you still not located an IBN 5100!?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“Sorry, nya. I have agents looking all over the world, but still no luck, nya.”[%p]
What, so she has no progress to report?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please hurry. I’m running out of time.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okay, nya! I’ll tell you as soon as I find one, Kyouma. Until then... hold on to your nine lives, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, I can’t die yet... El Psy Ko--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
She hung up before I could finish.[%p]
Dammit. That’s why I hate talking to Faris.[%p]
Anyway, moving on.[%p]
Even though I think I should answer it, my hand refuses to move.[%p]
My phone eventually goes silent.[%p]
I wipe the sweat off my brow in relief.[%p]
A second later, Mayuri’s phone starts ringing.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪ Mayushii here.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ah, Feris-chan. Good mornyan♪”[%p]
I twitch when I hear that name.[%p]
Mayuri looks at me.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kyouma? Oh, you mean Okarin? Yup, he’s here. Wanna talk to him?”[%p]
I make an X with my arms and shake my head. Faris is the last person I want to talk to now.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hmm? Um, it looks like he can’t talk.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...yup. ...mmhmm.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ok, I’ll tell him. Byebye♪”[%p]
I stride up to Mayuri once she hangs up.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well done, Mayuri. You’ll make a fine assistant yet. What did Faris want?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Well, she said that the Four Guardian Kings have assembled in Akiba, so be careful.”[%p]
Who are the Four Guardian Kings?[%p]
No, there’s no need to worry about it.[%p]
It’s just Faris’s usual nonsense.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t tell me that’s all she said?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, she also hasn’t found an IBN 5100 yet. She said if she does find one, she’ll contact you nyan.”[%p]
I see...[%p]
