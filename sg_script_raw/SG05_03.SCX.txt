This time around, my search for an IBN 5100 is going poorly. [%p]
...Actually, I suppose I should consider myself lucky for having found one so easily the first time.[%p]
I mean, the IBN 5100 is practically an urban legend. There are people, like Moeka, who’ve spent months searching with no success.[%p]
Last time, it barely took me three days to reach Yanabayashi Shrine, almost as if something was guiding me there.[%p]
It was fate... no, it was the choice of Steins Gate.[%p]
That’s why its loss is so painful.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Guess that’s why they call it the phantom PC.”[%p]
Daru is sitting at his computer, like always.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I read on @channel that some collectors will pay millions of yen to buy one.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“IBN 5100s are serious business, man.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If they have that high a premium...”[%p]
Then people must know their secret. They’re all after the data in SERN’s mainframe![%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I don’t get it. How come they’re so expensive?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I mean, I guess they were pretty expensive to begin with. Looks like one cost about $20,000 back in the day.”[%p]
$20,000... that is expensive.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Anyway, I can’t believe it’s so hard to find one. Sure it was a nice machine for its time, but only for its time. You’d have to be crazy to want one now.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Maybe it’s one guy buying them all up.”[%p]
The harder something is to obtain, the stronger the desire for it becomes. That’s how people are.[%p]
And that’s exactly how I feel now.[%p]
In the depths of SERN, completely isolated from the outside, lies a database coded with an IBN 5100. What secrets are sleeping there?[%p]
Could it contain the data from SERN’s time machine research?[%p]
Could there be proof that the Committee of 300 exists?[%p]
The desire to know grows stronger by the day.[%p]
It’s not just about plunging the world into chaos anymore.[%p]
We need the power to oppose SERN’s evil ambitions.[%p]
And then there’s that threatening email to consider.[%p]
Daru is confident that SERN won’t find us, but I can’t afford to take that for granted.[%p]
After all, we’re up against the brightest minds in the world, the scientists who invented the world wide web.[%p]
And they’re backed by a secret organization more powerful than any nation.[%p]
We’re way out of our league here.[%p]
They’d have no trouble at all crushing our puny lab if they desired.[%p]
That’s why we need a trump card to hold against them.[%p]
But without an IBN 5100, we can’t move forward.[%p]
I’m getting restless.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Woah, what’s this?”[%p]
Daru suddenly lurches forward to stare at his monitor.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But... there’s no way that’s right!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you talking about? Explain.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, I’m pulling data off the server, looking for a way to gain root access...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And these files are downloading crazy fast. I mean, we’re talking light speed here.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s hard to believe, but for some reason, this area has a direct fiber optic line to SERN. Several lines, even.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Direct? What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I mean there’s literally a fiber optic cable running from underneath this building to SERN’s headquarters in France.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is that strange?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uh, yeah?”[%p]
Daru calls up the National Assembly of France’s website.[%p]
Then he brings up the command prompt and hammers out some commands.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Have a look. This is the route we used to visit the National Assembly of France’s site.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]”It starts from our IP address. From there, it passes through various relays in Japan, jumps to France, then bounces around there for a while before finally reaching the National Assembly’s site.” [%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It takes 16 steps total to get there.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The average transfer rate is about 300 milliseconds. That’s normal for an overseas connection.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“In other words, there’s a route we have to take to get to France from Japan. Everyone takes the same route.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Other countries are the same. Even browsing domestically takes about 10 steps.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Now let’s try SERN.”[%p]
Daru calls up SERN’s homepage on the browser.[%p]
Then he displays the route like last time.[%p]
The result--[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s only one step...”[%p]
Unlike before, the signal doesn’t pass through any intermediate servers.[%p]
The PC we’re using -- its registered name is “AKIHABARA_PC” -- is connected directly to SERN in France.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And the transfer rate is hundreds of times better than usual. Crazy fast! You can’t even get these numbers domestically, man.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why do we have a direct line? Is this even possible?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It was like this when we found it. I didn’t do anything.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So the building already had a hotline to SERN?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This can’t be a coincidence. It might just be the choice of Stei--”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It doesn’t make sense. Why would there be an independent line running from here all the way to SERN?”[%p]
Daru’s so excited, he interrupted me.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“No Japanese or French telecommunication company would set up something like this. Which means...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“SERN did it themselves.”[%p]
Daru gulps and nods. Cold sweat oozes from his brow.[%p]
I feel a chill as well.[%p]
SERN might be able to see everything we’re doing.[%p]
No. Maybe...[%p]
Maybe SERN has been expecting us for years.[%p]
How could that be? The answer is simple.[%p]
John Titor claims that SERN completed their time machine in 2034. Just two years later, the world is a dystopia under their rule.[%p]
Maybe the SERN of 2034 considers our opposition in 2010 a threat.[%p]
Maybe they used their time machine to travel to 2000 and install a fiberoptic cable to track our every move.[%p]
It’s entirely possible.[%p]
Has the invention of the time machine started an inter-temporal war?[%p]
If so, what can we do?[%p]
Our enemy might be stronger than even I can imagine.[%p]
No, I mustn’t lose heart.[%p]
I need to think positive.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But thanks to this direct line, we can now control the LHC remotely.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You figured out how!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow! That’s amazing, Daru-kun.”[%p]
Mayuri pauses her DVD and comes up beside me.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“With a connection this fast, we can control the LHC practically in real-time. I haven’t actually tried it yet, though.”[%p]
That’s right. Even if this is some kind of SERN trap, we might be able to make use of it.[%p]
They’re still vulnerable to our attack.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The LHC is that 20-kilometer-long tunnel thing, right? Um, what does it do again?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It accelerates protons and smashes them together.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh yeah. Mini black holes, right?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The official line is that mini black holes [color index="A0140000"]might[color index="800000"] manifest as a byproduct of the particle collision, but that’s not the truth.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“According to the top secret documents we found, the LHC was [color index="A0140000"]intended[color index="800000"] to create black holes from the very beginning.”[%p]
But we still don’t know exactly how they do it.[%p]
We need to think of a way to--[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe.”[%p]
Kurisu suddenly emerges from the development room. She was cooped up in there all morning.[%p]
Her expression is unusually grave.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I figured it out.”[%p]
Figured what out?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I think I know how the PhoneWave works.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Really!?”[%p]
Kurisu nods. She still hasn’t smiled.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Keep in mind that this is just a hypothesis based on what we’ve observed.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s closely related to what you guys were just talking about -- the LHC.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I believe it was you, Christina, who called the LHC the world’s largest microwave. ”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yes. Exactly. My hunch was right.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’ve created a monster, Okabe.”[%p]
A monster...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It doesn’t belong in some amateur lab. And before you take that as an endorsement of your abilities, I mean it in a bad way.”[%p]
Kurisu clutches her arms as if to keep from trembling.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Give me details.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Did you know that the microwave oven was invented as a byproduct of radar research?”[%p]
Daru and I nod. Mayuri shakes her head.[%p]
We read up on all that back then the PhoneWave (name subject to change) started acting weird.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Microwaves are electromagnetic waves with a frequency of 2.45 gigahertz. The PhoneWave is commercial grade, so its output is around 1500-2000 watts.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Here’s the important part.”[%p]
Kurisu goes on to explain that the electromagnetic waves output by the microwave are somehow “connected” to the electromagnetic waves output by the phone.[%p]
In fact, you could say they “fuse together.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“According to Daru’s blueprints, the microwave and the phone are made to send out shared electromagnetic waves by taking their leads...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And hardwiring each of them to the [color index="820000"]magnetron[color index="800000"]’s cathode and anode.”[%p]
On one hand, we have the microwave’s super strong electromagnetic waves, originally a byproduct of the military’s research into radar technology.[%p]
On the other, we have the cellphone’s standardized electromagnetic waves, a frequency now ubiquitous throughout the world.[%p]
What happens when you “fuse” those two waves?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Both devices use electromagnetic waves. I’m not a specialist, though, so I can’t examine the extent or magnitude of the influence that fusion has...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But hypothetically, if the cellphone were to become a stepping stone, scattering the military-grade electromagnetic waves over a vast range of hundreds of kilometers--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then not just Akihabara, but all of Tokyo would turn into the inside of a microwave oven.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Taking into account slight variance due to body weight, the average time until death for the people inside would be--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Three minutes.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehh!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Seriously? Then the PhoneWave’s a weapon of mass destruction, isn’t it!?”[%p]
I-is it really that powerful?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Let me tell you what happens inside the PhoneWave.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The air inside the oven is full of invisible hydrogen atoms. First, it bombards the atoms with microwaves to increase their energy potential. This is the normal function of a microwave oven.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But when you add the electromagnetic waves from the phone...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The harmonics trigger a chain reaction. The particles collide repeatedly at near light-speed, gaining mass and energy each time.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In other words, it becomes a sort of particle accelerator.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A particle accelerator!?”[%p]
It’s literally the same as the LHC![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, if the LHC was created to generate mini black holes--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then the PhoneWave (name subject to change) must also produce mini black holes!”[%p]
Kurisu... doesn’t deny it.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]”It’s a miracle that thing has been so stable.” [%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But there’s still one thing I don’t understand.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Even if it does produce mini black holes, they should evaporate instantly.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But that’s not what happens in the PhoneWave. The gelification phenomenon proves that.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Just like in the LHC, our mini black holes are turning into Kerr black holes.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“According to Titor, you have to inject electrons to produce the Kerr black hole effect.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Where do the injected electrons come from? That’s what I don’t understand.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The LHC uses something called a lifter to inject electrons into the black hole and control the gravitational field.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Something is filling that role inside the PhoneWave.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“S-something?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Like I said, I don’t know what.”[%p]
So I guess that’s what it comes down to.[%p]
All Kurisu’s explanation does is confirm our hypothesis that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) functions the same as the LHC.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Looks like we need to review what the LHC is.”[%p]
It’s time for our “LHC moe” guy to shine.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“LHC stands for Large Hadron Collider.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Had drawn?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s the name of an elementary particle.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The LHC is basically a huge circular tunnel underneath Switzerland and France.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It sits about 100 meters below ground, and has a total length of 27 kilometers.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“There are two rings that run through the tunnel. Inside the rings is a super-low-temperature vacuum -- an environment like outer space, basically. Seriously moe.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“In an adjacent facility, protons are gradually accelerated by the linear accelerator, the Proton Synchrotron Booster, and the Super Proton Synchrotron.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Finally, they’re injected into the LHC, where they undergo their final acceleration via a series of superconducting magnets installed in the tunnel.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“By now, they’re traveling at up to 99.9999991% the speed of light. That’s enough to melt your brain. Not as dangerous as the PhoneWave, though.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Finally, the accelerated protons collide approximately 1 to 10 billion times per second.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The purpose of the LHC project is to study the high energy reactions that result... or so they say. We know they’re a bunch of stinking liars.”[%p]
I guess that about covers it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And that, my fellow lab members, brings us to the question. Can the PhoneWave (name subject to change) beat SERN to true physical time travel?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Two problems. One, setting the destination. Two, the lifter.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’ve already established that the D-Mail arrives precisely when and where it’s supposed to.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...It’s dangerous to accept that without verification.”[%p]
Agreed.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“As for the lifter, we already know it exists. We just need to figure out what it is.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t think we’re going to find it. The PhoneWave’s not exactly big, you know, and we’ve been poking at it for days without turning up a clue.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Even if we do find it, it’ll take forever to learn how to tune the electron feed properly.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“How long is forever?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“SERN’s been working on it for nine years and they still haven’t solved it.”[%p]
We’re just amateurs, so it’s bound to take even longer.[%p]
...Wait. I have an idea.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s look at it from a different angle.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“SERN tried to send people back in time, but they couldn’t get the electron feed right. The singularities were not naked.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s the same with the PhoneWave (name subject to change). You can only send 36 bytes of data safely. Otherwise, you get a Jellyman.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s consider the problem in reverse.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What if we could convert a human to data, then compress that data into just 36 bytes?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We could send that person through the ring singularity just like a D-Mail, couldn’t we!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Convert a human to data? That’s not even possible, man.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And even if it were, there’d be like [color index="A0140000"]exabytes[color index="800000"] of data or something! You want to compress that into 36 bytes? Are you high?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm... I thought it was a good idea...”[%p]
I guess it’s not that easy. The barriers to time travel are just too high.[%p]
I turn to Kurisu, meaning to ask her opinion, and then I realize that her expression has changed dramatically.[%p]
Her eyes are wide as saucers, and her mouth is hanging open.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Of course... If it works, then maybe...”[%p]
She pauses for a second, and then...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Maybe we can do it!”[%p]
Do what?[%p]
Time travel?[%p]
It’s hard to believe what Kurisu is saying, even though it was my idea in the first place.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you serious?”[%p]
Kurisu grins triumphantly in response.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The data compression part, at least, is easy.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We can just use the black holes created by the LHC, since black holes compress everything they swallow.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Compression won’t harm data like it would harm a human. As long as we’re just sending data, there’s nothing to worry about.”[%p]
I get it![%p]
But wait, can we really pull off such a stunt?[%p]
And besides...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How do you plan to convert humans into data?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You know that my thesis got published, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is no time to flaunt your accomplishments.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Have you read it?”[%p]
I haven’t.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ve got scans if you want to read it.”[%p]
Daru opens up his image folder, scrolls past tons of 2D porn, and opens up the scanned image.[%p]
Sure enough, there’s Kurisu’s name in big English letters.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The title of my thesis is...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Analysis of Memory-Related Nerve Impulses in the Temporal Lobe’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Temporal lobe? Nerve impulses?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What, you didn’t know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, wait. This can’t be right. This title sounds like, um, [color index="820000"]neuroscience[color index="800000"], not physics.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m a neuroscientist. Got a problem?”[%p]
What!?[%p]
I can’t believe it.[%p]
From the way she talks about particle accelerators and time travel theory, I was sure she had to be a physicist.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, forget about that. How is this related to time travel?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Converting an entire human to data is impossible.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But converting a human’s [color index="A0140000"]memories[color index="800000"] may be possible!”[%p]
Converting memories... to data?[%p]
Kurisu proceeds to explain her thesis.[%p]
Memories accumulate in something called the parahippocampal gyrus - or hippocampus - which is located in the temporal lobe of the brain.[%p]
But what exactly are memories?[%p]
Kurisu’s thesis analyzes that question from a neuroscientific perspective.[%p]
All of the brain’s functions manifest as electrical signals running through its neurons. Even memories are written to the hippocampus by electrical signals.[%p]
Kurisu analyzed how specific electrical signals correspond to specific memories.[%p]
The mechanism by which humans recall memories can be likened to a word association game. You begin with a vague, abstract image, which calls successive images of increasing clarity.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Imagine a chest of drawers. Each drawer is filled with tiny boxes, and inside each box is another bunch of tiny boxes. You keep opening boxes until you find the memory you’re looking for.”[%p]
Kurisu discovered that the number of “retrieval commands” -- nerve impulses used to search up memories -- is surprisingly low. Out of hundreds of millions of nerve impulse patterns in the brain, only a few thousand are related to memory.[%p]
It was the successful analysis of these patterns that earned Kurisu and her research team critical acclaim in the scientific community.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Now, before you ask how this relates to time travel, there’s one more thing I need to explain.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Several years ago, my lab -- the Neurophysiology Lab at Victor Condoria University -- developed a technology called Visual Rebuilding, or VR for short.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]”Put simply, it enables conversion of video data into nerve impulse signals.” [%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Used in reverse, it can also convert nerve impulses into video data, or any other kind of electronic data.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So, if we combine VR technology with my research... do you see where I’m going?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...No way.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We can convert memories into data?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Not just that. Memory transplantation, backups, external storage... all of those things become possible.”[%p]
It’s like science fiction...[%p]
In a sense, this technology could be used to copy a person’s soul.[%p]
According to Kurisu, some religious groups strongly opposed this research, as you might expect.[%p]
On the other hand, the medical community is ecstatic about the possibilities.[%p]
In any case, it’s amazing that my assistant here was able to make such an incredible discovery.[%p]
Of course, she did have a university supporting her, but still.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So basically, what you’re saying is that we convert the subject’s memories into video data...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Use the LHC’s black hole to compress that data into 36 bytes...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Send that data through the Kerr black hole inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change)...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And finally, imprint those memories on the subject’s brain in the past.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What does that mean?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We can send our memories back in time.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In order to differentiate it from physical time travel, let’s call it a ’time leap’ for now.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You don’t go back, just your memories.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s so crazy that nobody’s thought of it before.”[%p]
She’s right. The idea is ridiculous, which is exactly why none of the geniuses at SERN could come up with it.[%p]
But this union of physics, neuroscience, and neurophysiology will make the impossible possible.[%p]
To transfer memories to the past via cellphone. To time leap.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The important thing to remember is that only memories are being transferred.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Personality and consciousness aren’t included.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What does that mean? How is it different from what you see in sci-fi novels?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Time leaping in sci-fi usually sends everything -- consciousness, personality, and memory.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But in real life, there’s probably too much data, and besides, we only analyzed memories.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Think of consciousness, personality, and memory as separate things.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Memories are like the video data stored on your computer.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And consciousness and personality are like the OS.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But videos can take up way more space than the OS.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s just an example.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“For starters, it’s still not clear where personality and consciousness are located, or how they are constructed.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So we can’t convert them into data. Or at least, I can’t.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So we can only send memories. Where does that leave us?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Your memories aren’t the only thing that define you. Even if you send your memories to the past, it will be the receiving you’s consciousness and personality that process them.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So in [color index="820000"]Mindorz[color index="800000"] terms, it’s like copying data from a VISTA computer to a Min95 computer?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Data created with the latest OS might not work on an older OS. It might cause errors.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“For example, if you sent your current memories to yourself in elementary school, the gap between your memories and your body could have serious consequences.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, is it correct to assume that we’ll be targeting ourselves in the past?”[%p]
Kurisu nods at my question.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Just like with D-Mail, we’re using cellphones as the transfer medium.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“To be precise, you can only leap into your own body, and only if you had a cellphone at the time of reception.”[%p]
There was an exception in Lukako’s case where we sent a D-Mail to a pager, but that doesn’t apply to time leaping.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you try sending memories to someone else... umm, how do I put this... there’s a danger that the electrical signals might be rejected.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wouldn’t want to jump into someone else’s body. I mean, unless it’s the body of a cute girl. Uhehe!”[%p]
Is this guy capable of a non-perverted thought?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t ’uhehe’ me, you idiot!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If it just bounces off, that’s fine, but I’m worried incompatible memory data might do serious damage to the recipient’s psyche.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t know what might happen. No one’s done it before, after all.”[%p]
That makes us pioneers. I like it.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There are two things I do know. One, you definitely cannot go back before you were born; and two, you won’t exist in two places at once.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That means you don’t have to worry about causing a paradox. You can’t kill your parents before you were born.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So the phones act like black and white holes...”[%p]
It seems like a strange coincidence that cellphones would be the medium of time travel, but really, could it have been anything else?[%p]
These days, people wear their phones like a second skin. No other medium could reliably deliver the memories to their intended target.[%p]
The more I think about it, the more I realize that this was [color index="A0140000"]meant to be[color index="800000"].[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh... heh heh heh... MUHAHAHA!”[%p]
I whip out my phone and place it to my ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. Everything is falling into place. The plan can now proceed to the final stage. I’m talking about Operation [color index="820000"]Verthandi[color index="800000"], obviously.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh. Christina had me fooled. I never knew she was capable of this. It must have been the choice of Steins Gate that sent her here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry. I have everything under control. Nothing can stop us now. El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
I put away my phone and turn to Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Were you listening? Good. Commence preparations for Operation Verthandi!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“First, explain what that is!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’re going to build your time leap machine, Christina. And you’d better not say it can’t be done! Not after showing me the way!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well, this [color index="A0140000"]is[color index="800000"] Akihabara. I should be able to find the parts I need.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then it’s decided. I’m placing you in charge of this operation. Whatever you need, ask, and it shall be yours.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Together, we shall complete the first time leap machine in human history!”[%p]
Kurisu nods. Her eyes are shining with a fierce, hungry light.[%p]
As I thought. She’s a scientist to the core![%p]
