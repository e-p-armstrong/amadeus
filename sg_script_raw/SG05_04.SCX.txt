Mayuri and Daru go home, leaving me with Kurisu.[%p]
She’s sitting in the development room chair, endlessly twirling a pen in her fingers.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thinking about the time leap machine.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I know we can make it, but I’m wondering what will happen if we actually use it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah.”[%p]
She hasn’t even started working on the machine, and she’s already worried about what comes afterwards?[%p]
That takes confidence, alright. Are all geniuses like this?[%p]
What will happen when we use it...[%p]
I doubt we can find an answer to that question. Not without testing it live.[%p]
Kurisu knows that. What she’s really wondering is whether it’s worth the risk.[%p]
That’s why I avoid arguing with her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re thinking too hard. Finish the machine, then worry about it.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re so pompous.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu groans and flops down on the desk.[%p]
It’s strange to see her like this. She’s usually so cool and collected.[%p]
But maybe that’s an act, and this is who she really is.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, Okabe...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Can I talk to you about something completely unrelated?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’d rather talk about something related.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You told me before that I could ask you anything. Remember?”[%p]
I did?[%p]
I don’t remember that.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I think... my father hates me.”[%p]
She sighs sadly.[%p]
Ah, so that’s what she wants to talk about.[%p]
A conundrum. This isn’t like before, when she was merely an advisor. The time leap project [color index="A0140000"]depends[color index="800000"] on Kurisu to succeed.[%p]
It is clear, however, that she will be unable to focus as long as these petty concerns distract her.[%p]
In that case, it falls to me, the great Hououin Kyouma, to solve her problem once and for all![%p]
Only then can she devote herself fully to the future of the lab![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Very well. Speak!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Heh... you really are pompous.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I assume it was your father on the phone the other day?”[%p]
I am speaking, of course, of when I found Kurisu outside the lab, crying into her phone.[%p]
The mood was... delicate.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t remember the last time he had a kind word for me.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Even when we were living together, before I went to America, he acted like I wasn’t there. We’re supposed to be family, aren’t we?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And you? How did you treat your father?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I was daddy’s little girl growing up. You practically had to drag me away from him.”[%p]
She smiles, but in her smile I see a hint of self-mockery.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“My father’s a physicist. Even as a child, I loved to hear him talk about science. I couldn’t understand a word of it, but I always begged him to explain.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I wanted to understand his work, so I started studying physics. I must have been five.”[%p]
Damn. I guess that’s what makes her a genius.[%p]
Or perhaps the yearning for her father’s love was what gave birth to her genius.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thanks to that, I always got perfect grades in math. I ignored all the other subjects, though, so my grades were a little skewed.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I even read my father’s papers. I was a little girl trying to comprehend theoretical physics, but I gave it everything I had. I [color index="A0140000"]needed[color index="800000"] to understand.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“By sixth grade, I had learned enough that I could discuss my father’s theories with him.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I was so happy that I could talk to my father on his level, you know? We used to argue all night long.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And then I started winning those arguments. All of them.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. I can definitely see how that would make him hate you.”[%p]
A tragedy fitting for a girl genius.[%p]
What kind of scientist loses to a grade-school girl anyway? Seriously.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You really think that’s why?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m absolutely certain that’s why.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I guess he did have a lot of pride.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, one day, he suddenly stopped talking to me altogether.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then he started fighting with my mom, and finally he stopped coming home.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I really loved my dad, so it was a big shock. I felt it was my fault things turned out that way. I couldn’t go to school, I was so depressed.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And then Mom recommended I study abroad.”[%p]
So that’s why she went to America.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You were just too talented for your own good.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, how do you feel about your father now?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t know...”[%p]
Kurisu looks down.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“He’s in Japan, right? Have you seen him at all?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No... he doesn’t want to see me.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s what we were talking about on the phone. I asked if we could meet, but he told me to stay away from him.”[%p]
Her father has quite the inferiority complex.[%p]
No wonder she was crying. Even for someone as strong-willed as Kurisu, it must hurt to hear that from her father.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Even if we did meet, I wouldn’t know what to say...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I tried to talk to him before I left, you know? I tried so hard, but he just ignored me.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It hurts. Whenever I think about going to see him, I remember those times. I worry he’ll ignore me again, and then I can’t do anything.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sniff...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you crying?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“J-just a little, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You want to reconcile with your father. Correct?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t know...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you didn’t, then you wouldn’t have confided in me. And you wouldn’t be crying, would you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“True...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just be straight with him. Say ’I love you, Dad. Let’s make up.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I think that’s a little out of character for me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s your father. Stop acting like a weak little girl.”[%p]
Kurisu jerks upright, her face bright red.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m not acting like a little girl!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes, you are. You’ll never reconcile with him like that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You need to speak from the heart, give it to him straight.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s the only way to get your message across. You can’t sugarcoat it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If that doesn’t work, nothing will. Then you’ll just have to hope that time heals the rift between you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And how long will that take?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How should I know? I’m only a year older than you, remember?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How long has it been since you went to America?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Umm... seven years.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If nothing has changed in seven years, then maybe it will take twice that much time.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I... guess you’re right.”[%p]
Kurisu sighs heavily and rests her chin in her hand.[%p]
Did my advice backfire? It looks like she’s even more depressed now.[%p]
I fold my arms and wrack my brain for a solution.[%p]
I don’t want to see Kurisu like this. It’s pathetic![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well? When are you going to see him?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Huh?”[%p]
Kurisu opens her eyes wide in confusion.[%p]
I take out my phone and bring up the calendar.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I assume it’ll be during summer break. Make sure you let me know ahead of time.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wha-wha-wha-what are you talking about!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I might have plans. I’ll need to shift my schedule around.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hold on a second! Don’t tell me you plan on coming along!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course I do. You are my assistant, and I will do whatever it takes to ensure that you are in peak mental condition for the experiment.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu looks dumbfounded.[%p]
What? Did I say something wrong?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ok, you’ve had your fun. I’m in no mood for--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m being completely serious.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll go anywhere you want -- anywhere in Japan. I’d go anywhere in the world, but I don’t have a passport or money.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re afraid you won’t know what to say, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then that settles it. I am a master of conversation. You will have nothing to fear with Hououin Kyouma at your side!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...pfft!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why are you laughing!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You couldn’t hold a normal conversation if your life depended on it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah...”[%p]
By Jove, she’s right! A mad scientist does not care about things like tact and decorum. He dominates the room with his sheer presence![%p]
Perhaps a softer touch is called for here.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But... thanks anyway. I definitely didn’t expect you to offer to come...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“N-not that I’m happy about it or anything!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I hate how you act like a nice guy sometimes! It’s confusing!”[%p]
Confusing how?[%p]
Why is she yelling at me anyway? Shouldn’t she be thanking me instead?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Um, Okabe? That offer... I can take you up on it, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then, once we’re done upgrading the PhoneWave...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I want you to come with me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“As you wish. Where is your father, anyway?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Aomori.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aomori!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s where he lives now.”[%p]
That’s way up at the north end of the island, like seven hundred kilometers or something. I wasn’t expecting to have to go that far.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What? You’re not going to back out, are you? You already promised. I’m taking you whether you like it or not, okay!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...A-Aomori it is!”[%p]
If promising to go to Aomori will let Kurisu concentrate on the time leap machine, it’s a small price to pay.[%p]
A small price indeed.[%p]
