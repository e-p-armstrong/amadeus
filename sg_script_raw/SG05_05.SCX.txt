Kurisu and Daru go home, leaving me with Mayuri.[%p]
I thought she was hard at work on her costume, but when I look, I find her staring at the wall. Her hands have stopped moving.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri? You’re not going home?”[%p]
She usually doesn’t stay this late. Her parents might be worried.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, I was thinking about what Okarin and Chris-chan were talking about earlier.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I was trying to figure out what the things you said meant, but it was all so complicated. I didn’t get any of it. Ehehe...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The only thing I get is that something amazing is gonna happen!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Indeed. The world is about to change, and we shall be the ones to lead humanity into the future.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’re shining, Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Shining? What does that mean?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’re shining. Chris-chan too. Like two bright stars in the sky.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That must be my aura of madness you’re sensing. Muhahaha!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You know, it’s been ten days since Chris-chan joined us. Can I tell you how I’ve been feeling?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Since Chris-chan became a lab mem, it feels like things have really started to happen, like we’re a real lab now, you know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh. I must admit, her knowledge has been a great asset.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course, the girl genius would never have joined us if not for the cunning of Hououin Kyouma!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s why you’re shining so bright now, Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Chris-chan is really a big help to you, I know...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But I can’t do anything to help...”[%p]
Mayuri looks depressed.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I wish I were smart too... then maybe I could help.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri...”[%p]
She’s never expressed such sentiments before.[%p]
Is she jealous of Kurisu’s talents?[%p]
Is there competition brewing in the lab?[%p]
I sigh and walk to the window.[%p]
I can’t see many stars in the sky.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri. Aren’t you going to look at the stars?”[%p]
Mayuri comes up beside me.[%p]
We lean out the window together.[%p]
It’s only 9 PM, but Akiba is already still and silent, save for the occasional car trundling by.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Back when the lab just started -- before Daru-kun joined -- it was like this a lot, wasn’t it? All quiet, just the two of us.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, it was.”[%p]
Daru joined the lab in early May.[%p]
Before that, he was unwilling to join no matter how I tried to convince him.[%p]
Then he learned that the lab was just three minutes away from MayQueen+Nyan², and suddenly he was all “Future Gadget Lab, hell yeah!”[%p]
But for about a month and a half after the lab’s founding, it was just me and Mayuri all alone.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Can Mayushii stay here? Is it really okay?”[%p]
Mayuri looks at me with uncertainty in her eyes.[%p]
I meet her gaze firmly, then bop her lightly on the head.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t be ridiculous.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“All you need to do is stay.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Just... stay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Without you, the lab would be a much less friendly place.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You see how Kurisu and I argue. We can be pretty stubborn, and sometimes we don’t know when to stop.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But when it starts to get out of hand, Mayuri, you’re always there with some ditzy, irrelevant comment to break the tension.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um... are you praising me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course I am.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry about a thing. Just know that you, too, are part of my plan. Muhahaha!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay. Thanks, Okarin♪”[%p]
Mayuri smiles in relief.[%p]
And then her stomach rumbles.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m starving! I’ll warm up some canned oden. You want some too?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. Heat it up.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Coming right up!”[%p]
Soon, we are chowing down on piping hot oden.[%p]
