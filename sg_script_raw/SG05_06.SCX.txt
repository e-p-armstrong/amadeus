The next day, Mayuri and I go shopping at Radi-Kan.[%p]
We have a list, written by Kurisu, of parts for the time leap machine.[%p]
Naturally, I’m paying for everything out of my own pocket.[%p]
Kurisu and Daru have already started work on the upgrade.[%p]
Apparently, the conversion of memories into digital data requires software developed at Kurisu’s lab in America.[%p]
She can download that software from their dedicated server.[%p]
But that’s not the only thing we need.[%p]
There’s also some kind of brain-scanning headgear that we’re going to have to make ourselves.[%p]
Incidentally, I have to pay extra-close attention to make sure Mayuri doesn’t wander off while we’re shopping.[%p]
If she sees some random store that interests her, she’ll literally stop and stare at it for hours.[%p]
I keep walking, of course, and only later realize that she’s not behind me. [%p]
Then I have to run from store to store looking for her.[%p]
This must be how parents of small children feel.[%p]
Anyway, this is nothing new. Mayuri has always been like this.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m begging you, stick with me. If you get lost in this labyrinth of technology, you’ll never escape. Not with your sense of direction.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okey-dokey! I’ll be careful.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, by the way. How is time leaping different from time travel?”[%p]
Did she really hear what I just said about not wandering off?[%p]
Besides, Kurisu already explained the difference yesterday.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Time travel means your whole body travels through time. The time leap will only send your memories to the past. It’s simple.”[%p]
Just memories. No personality or consciousness included, although Kurisu did mention that there was no way to be sure what might happen to your consciousness.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Does that mean you can do things with time leaps that you can’t do with D-Mails?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“D-Mails can only send instructions to the past. The past may change, or it may not. The results are unpredictable, and depend on the recipient.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And when the past does change, the worldline is reconfigured. Everyone loses their old memories.”[%p]
I am the exception, thanks to Reading Steiner.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“With a time leap, on the other hand, you can give your past self not just instructions, but all of the memories you have right now... or at least, that’s the idea.”[%p]
We won’t know for sure if it works until the machine is built.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ummm, so I could send the costume I’m making back to last week? I would love to have another week to prepare for ComiMa.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That might be possible with time travel, but not with time leaping.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Say you had a test last week. Now that you know the answers, you could send that knowledge to yourself and ace the test. But you couldn’t go back and hand yourself a cheat sheet.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So Mayushii’s mind goes into Mayushii one week ago?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Exactly.”[%p]
While this conversation has been going on, I’ve been steadily purchasing items from Kurisu’s shopping list.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You can’t bring stuff, but you can bring your memories... I get it.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But, then what about Mayushii one week ago? Where do her memories go?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I assume they get overwritten.”[%p]
We haven’t tested it, though, so there’s no way to be sure.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“She disappears?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your memories right now include your memories from back then. So even if she does disappear, you don’t really lose anything.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I guess you could say you’re just adding your memories from one week in the future.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Then, if Mayushii’s memories leap into the Mayushii one week ago, what happens to Mayushii now?”[%p]
Mayuri’s asking some pretty philosophical questions today.[%p]
But I guess anyone would ask the same.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s memories jump to the past, but my body’s still here, right? What happens to me when my memories go bye-bye?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You become an empty shell... no... that can’t be right. That wouldn’t make sense.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“My assistant’s device merely records your memory data... in other words, it’s just a backup. Your original memories are still inside you.”[%p]
Nothing inside the brain is lost.[%p]
You don’t become an empty shell.[%p]
Besides, neither personality nor consciousness is transferred to begin with.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your body shouldn’t become an empty shell, and your consciousness shouldn’t leap, either.”[%p]
...No, wait. There’s another issue here.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Actually, won’t you become a new Mayuri, one who received memories from the future one week ago?”[%p]
Not that anybody, including me, would be able to tell the difference.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Then, does the Mayushii who had the normal memories before the time leap get erased by the Mayushii who repeated the week with extra memories?”[%p]
...This is getting complicated.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s right. She’s erased. In other words, you relive the week. You can do things the same, or you could do something completely different.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And you’ll keep your old memories of the week that disappeared.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Then, does that mean...”[%p]
The questions keep coming.[%p]
She’s trying hard to understand in her own ditzy way.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So I redo the week, okay... but what if I decide to go to Ikebukuro with my friends instead of coming to the lab today?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What happens to the Mayushii talking with Okarin now?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The present would change to match the past, and this conversation would never happen.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh... and you wouldn’t notice the difference, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Right. No one would notice.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That would be kinda sad...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“For who? Me?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“No. For Mayushii.”[%p]
I don’t get what she means.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Maybe that’s why Chris-chan doesn’t want to change the past.”[%p]
She nods to herself with a bright smile.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh! I just thought of something. Can you time leap into the future?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe, but there wouldn’t be a point.”[%p]
Kurisu and I reached that conclusion yesterday.[%p]
The memories you send overwrite the memories at your destination.[%p]
If you sent your memories one week into the future, then the future you would lose one week of memories.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The whole point of our time leap machine is to affect past events. We don’t need to worry about the future.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Besides, you’re less likely to reach the future than you are the past.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And that’s because the future is inherently unpredictable.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“For example, do you think you’ll have the same phone number for all eternity?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“How should I know? Ehehe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Exactly my point.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And remember, pagers became obsolete with the advent of cellphones. Similarly, our phones may be replaced by some other device in the future.”[%p]
In order for the time leap to succeed, the target “you” must have a phone whose number you know.[%p]
As long as that condition is met, there should never be a problem with setting the destination.[%p]
The real problem is what inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is acting as the lifter.[%p]
Until we figure that out, we can’t reproduce the discharge phenomenon at will. The PhoneWave (name subject to change) will remain incomplete.[%p]
On the other hand, if we [color index="A0140000"]can[color index="800000"] figure it out, we’ll have an endless source of electrons that, unlike SERN’s, needs no tuning.[%p]
I’m exhilarated.[%p]
The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is evolving by the day.[%p]
Our invention of the time leap machine will put us light years ahead of SERN.[%p]
Time travel will finally become a reality.[%p]
I can’t wait to try it out.[%p]
My soul yearns for the taste of chaos.[%p]
I barely manage to keep from bursting out in mad laughter.[%p]
Come to think of it, more than one week has passed since we sent the first D-Mail, and although there was that strange threatening email, there remains no sign of men in black coming to haul us away.[%p]
According to Daru, SERN hasn’t discovered our hacking, either.[%p]
The next problem is what will happen when we use the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
In order to compress a human’s entire wealth of memory into the requisite thirty-six bytes, we have to “borrow” the LHC’s black hole.[%p]
I can’t believe that SERN won’t notice an unauthorized activation of the LHC.[%p]
How do we keep them from finding us?[%p]
We need a plan.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh... I guess I can’t go back to grade school, can I? I didn’t have a phone back then.”[%p]
Mayuri’s still talking about the time leap.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You want to go back to your elementary school days?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh, I know exactly how you feel. If you repeat elementary school with the knowledge you have now, you’ll get top grades and have an easy time bending children to your will.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah, and I thought maybe I could see Grandma again.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I see. I’m afraid that’s not possible.”[%p]
Mayuri’s grandmother passed away when Mayuri was in elementary school.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah... It’s too bad, but I guess I don’t really [color index="A0140000"]need[color index="800000"] to see her.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I still remember her words, her smile, and her wrinkly hand patting my head.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So even if I don’t see her again, I’m okay.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What I really want is to see little Okarin again! Ehehe!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh. Back then, I was already a scientist without equal, a titan towering above the other children.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can hardly be blamed for desiring to meet the child prodigy who would one day be feared as the great mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I don’t want to meet Hououin Whatshisface. I want to meet Okarin!”[%p]
I am Hououin Kyouma. Always have been, always will be.[%p]
Mayuri just doesn’t get it.[%p]
So I disregard her comment.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, there’s no point. You haven’t matured at all since that time, so nothing would change if you went back to elementary school anyway.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey! That’s not true. Mayushii’s all grown up now.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The only thing that’s grown is how much you eat.”[%p]
And your breast size.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s not true! Mayushii’s a real woman now.”[%p]
A real woman? I kind of want to hear the details, but she probably doesn’t know what she’s talking about.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Besides, I think Okarin’s the one who hasn’t changed since then.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Isn’t that what I said? I was already a genius mad scientist when you met me! MUHAHAHA!”[%p]
The shopkeeper shoots me a glare.[%p]
I guess this isn’t the best place for maniacal laughter.[%p]
Better get those parts and head back to the lab.[%p]
