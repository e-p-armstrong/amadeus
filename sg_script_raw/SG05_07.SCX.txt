We finish our shopping and come out in front of the station.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By the way, Mayuri. Have you not been working recently?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Working? You mean at Lemoine?”[%p]
Of course. MayQueen+Nyan² doesn’t exist in the current “wholesome” Akiba.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, ComiMa’s coming up, so I’m taking a few days off.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’ve got costumes to make!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How many costumes are you making this year?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Three. One for Kaede-chan, one for Fubuki-chan, and then there’s one for Luka-chan.”[%p]
I wonder if Lukako is still refusing to wear it.[%p]
I can hardly blame him. I mean, however cute he looks, he’s still a guy.[%p]
No, wait. That was before we sent the D-Mail. Now Lukako’s a girl, I guess. How confusing.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ah... it’s Moeka-san.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
I look where Mayuri’s pointing and see Moeka squatting by the staircase, staring hard at her cellphone.[%p]
She looks more tired than the last time I saw her.[%p]
There are bags under her eyes, and her hair is frayed.[%p]
The intensity of her expression makes me hesitate to call out to her.[%p]
She’ll probably just ignore me like before.[%p]
On the other hand, she is a lab mem. I can’t just ignore her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Finger! Why the long face, eh?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪ Moeka-san. What are you doing here?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka doesn’t look up.[%p]
She mutters something that I can’t make out.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, are you listening? If you have a problem, the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, will gladly assist!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But be warned. By the time I’m through, Akiba will be an ocean of blood... heh heh heh.”[%p]
Moeka suddenly jerks upright as if poked with an electric prod.[%p]
She lifts her head and stares at me with wide eyes, then jumps to her feet and walks right up to me.[%p]
This is the first time I’ve seen Moeka express such emotion.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What is it? What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
She doesn’t speak. That hasn’t changed.[%p]
Instead, she looks down and starts typing on her phone.[%p]
Guess I should be ready for a mail.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean, what happened?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We don’t fully understand it yet. We’re in the middle of upgrading it.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s amazing! This time, we might even be able to time leap.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t write anything about it. Otherwise we’ll have to expel you from the lab.”[%p]
Moeka shakes her head violently.[%p]
Guess she won’t write an article.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Our hacking of SERN has uncovered a new possibility for the PhoneWave (name subject to change).”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s a form of time travel made possible by borrowing SERN’s equipment.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This discovery will begin a new age of human civilization. No longer will men be slaves to time. Any future you desire can be yours!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And history will record that we, the Future Gadget Laboratory, changed the world forever!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Okarin, that was really confusing. You lost Mayushii.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
How can you not be moved by my speech? I’m talking about becoming legends here.[%p]
Moeka bites her lip and types out a mail in irritation.[%p]
Then she grabs my arm and digs in her fingernails. It hurts.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“U-unhand me!”[%p]
But Moeka does not listen.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The time leap is a way to send your memories to the past!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We found a way to make that possible. Soon we will complete the machine and become the undisputed lords of time!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Okarin came up with the idea and Chris-chan told us how to do it. Daru-kun’s helping, and Mayushii and Okarin are shopping♪”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka suddenly releases me. Her eyes are blank, unfocused.[%p]
She squats down on the spot, just as we found her. She seems entirely drained of energy and will.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Are you okay, Moeka-san? Do you feel sick?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t be sure. There are still several problems remaining. If they don’t give us too much trouble, I guess we’ll have it done in a week.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“On the other hand, we can’t do anything until they’re solved.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Everything is the choice of Steins Gate. I have faith there exists a path to success.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And once the door is opened, the chaos for which I have so longed shall at last descend upon the Earth. Trumpets will sound from the highest heaven, and the final battle, Ragnarok, will begin!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Who are you fighting, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The Organization, of course. Their rule must end once and for all.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow! Don’t do anything dangerous, okay?”[%p]
Why does Mayuri insist on worrying about me?[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Hehe...”[%p]
Oh?[%p]
Moeka’s lips curve into a smile.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Hehehe...”[%p]
She rises to her feet unsteadily, then staggers off into the crowd. It’s like she’s forgotten about us completely.[%p]
Mayuri and I can only watch her go. There’s an indescribable [color index="A0140000"]aura[color index="800000"] about her that holds us back.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What do you think is wrong with Moeka-san?”[%p]
I’ve known she was kind of strange ever since I met her, but this...[%p]
Maybe she’s an escaped mental patient or something.[%p]
Heh... not that her insanity can possibly compare to mine![%p]
For I desire nothing less than total and absolute chaos![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Muha, muhahaha, MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Whaaah? Now Okarin’s acting weird!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s worried...”[%p]
Mayushii looks scared, so I cease my maniacal laughter a few minutes earlier than planned.[%p]
