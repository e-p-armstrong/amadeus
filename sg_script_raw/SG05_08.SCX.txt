Afterwards, Mayuri and I go our separate ways. She apparently has to deliver a costume to her friend Fubuki.[%p]
When I return to the lab with my spoils of war, something surprising -- though not too surprising, come to think of it -- catches my eye.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ah...”[%p]
Kurisu is on the computer.[%p]
As soon as she notices I’ve returned, she quickly closes the window on the screen.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“H-hey! Think you could knock!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This isn’t your room. Besides, I’d have to be a fool to knock. There could be assassins lying in ambush.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Assassins? Here? Are you stupid?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, Christina. What were you looking at just now, hmm?”[%p]
I already know the answer, of course. I caught a glimpse of the screen before she closed it.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I was... doing research!”[%p]
Looks like she plans to continue this charade.[%p]
I drop my bags and go to the computer.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“S-stay back!”[%p]
I slip past Kurisu’s blocking arms and restore the minimized window.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“G-got a problem?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...pfft!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey! What’s with that ’this is awful, rofl rofl’ laughter!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have no fear, Christina. Or should I call you... @channeler Chris!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t call me that!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh, I already knew. That’s right! I realized long ago that you were an @channeler!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can’t hide it from me. You reek of @channel corruption!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“How rude! I make sure to apply light perfume every day!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Fool. That’s not what I meant. I’m talking about the scent of your soul.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“My soul? What’s that supposed to mean? Explain.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why? So you can learn how to hide it?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sh-shut up! Just explain already.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s nothing to explain. You use @channel memes in conversation. I’d have to be stupid not to notice.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Feels bad, man.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s an @channel meme too.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ugh...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your soul is tainted with the essence of @channel. You cannot hide it, not in such close proximity to another who uses @channel memes in actual conversation. Your souls resonate.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s it! It’s all Hashida’s fault!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But it’s cute how you try to hide it, @channeler Chris.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“DON’T CALL ME THAT.”[%p]
She glares at me hard.[%p]
If looks could kill...[%p]
She has no sense of humor at all. I should be more careful in the future.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I don’t understand. You were raised in America, so how are you so familiar with @channel?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You can browse @channel from America. Need I say more?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ahh, I get it. Living in an English-only environment made you hungry for Japanese. But did you have to resort to @channel?”[%p]
I mean, if you believe the pseudo-intellectuals in the media, browsing @channel is like reading scribbles on the bathroom wall. [%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sure, it’s not the friendliest place, but I couldn’t find anywhere that felt more ’Japanese’.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, can I ask a favor?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What is it?”[%p]
Kurisu turns away and mumbles something.[%p]
But her voice is so low, I can’t make it out.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you have something to say, say it.”[%p]
Kurisu turns bright red, but her sullen expression doesn’t change.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t tell anyone else about this.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What difference does it make? Daru’s the most hardcore @channeler who ever lived, and Mayuri’s an otaku too. Even I browse @channel regularly.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s nothing to be ashamed of! Just boldly write ’Hobbies: Browsing @channel’ on your resume!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Not a chance, you idiot!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What!? You mean you’d rather post [color index="820000"]anchors[color index="800000"] on [color index="820000"]VIP[color index="800000"]!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Gh, I hate myself for understanding those words!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, whatever. If it will help you focus on the time leap machine, I’ll keep your secret for now. Besides, it’s just a matter of time before you make another mistake and reveal your true colors.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You don’t have to worry about me. Remember that I represented my entire laboratory when we presented our research, even though there were men twice my age on the project.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m an expert at dealing with people. I’ll have no trouble keeping it a secret.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...[color index="820000"]Nullpo.[color index="800000"]”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Gah!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No...!”[%p]
Kurisu’s face gets even redder, and then she falls to her hands and knees in defeat. [color index="820000"]orz[color index="800000"][%p]
Just as I thought, @channel is in her blood and bones.[%p]
She doesn’t have a prayer.[%p]
