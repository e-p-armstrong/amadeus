As night fell, we tried to activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change) again, but as expected, the discharge did not occur.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“*yawn*...”[%p]
Mayuri is at her sewing machine, putting some finishing touches on a costume.[%p]
She got back earlier this evening, after delivering a different costume to her friend, Fubuki-chan. She’s been working on this costume ever since.[%p]
Come to think of it, she usually heads home around 7 or 8, but today, she’s still hard at work.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, go home before it gets too late. Your parents will worry.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s okay. I’m gonna stay the night.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...R-really?”[%p]
She’s never done that before.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup. I already told Mom and Dad.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you staying to work on your costume?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It won’t be done in time for ComiMa if I don’t. Ehehe!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m surprised your parents let you stay.”[%p]
I’ve met her parents any number of times. They’re as ditzy as Mayuri.[%p]
But still, I don’t think they’d appreciate their underage daughter staying overnight in this dirty lab.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It must be my overwhelming charisma... No, wait, that makes me sound like a good person, so that can’t be it...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course! Mayuri’s parents are so afraid of my insanity that they sent me their only daughter as a hostage!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Reported.”[%p]
Kurisu calls out from the development room.[%p]
She’s been tinkering with the PhoneWave (name subject to change), but I guess she was listening.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What would you do if I called the cops on you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I unleash my right arm on traitors, Christina.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yeah, yeah, chuunibyou, whatever.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, I told Mom and Dad that Chris-chan would be here. Then they said okay.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wait, so I have to stay too?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup♪ Don’t you have to work on the PhoneWave?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I guess... but I don’t relish the thought of spending the night here. At least, not with a certain somebody around.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Environment matters, Christina. This is a place of science and research, so you should have no trouble concentrating on your work. Trust the great Hououin Kyouma.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Also, it may surprise you to learn that I have equipped this lab with a system that stimulates brain function.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So if you were wondering where my incredible genius comes from, now you know! It’s because I sleep in this room every night!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This stimulation system of yours... I assume it’s been dumping toxic waste in your brain?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You sound like an environmentalist, Zombie.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ah, Mayushii knows! You’re talking about that, right?”[%p]
Kurisu comes out of the development room to check what Mayuri’s pointing at.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This... air freshener?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin said the smell makes you smarter. He bought it at Akiba-o. When was that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...About six months ago. It was on sale for 500 yen.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m starting to think even you don’t believe the stuff you say.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And besides, this air freshener is empty.”[%p]
Yeah. When I went to buy replacement packs, they had already stopped selling them.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well, whatever. I was planning to stay either way. I’ll join you, Mayuri-san.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really? That’s great!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“On one condition. Okabe leaves.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Me, leave? I practically live here! This lab was promised to me by Steins Gate. It’s the dwelling place of my soul!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We girls are staying here overnight, so you filthy boys need to show respect. Your home isn’t even far from here, right?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin lives close to Mayushii, in Ikebukuro.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why, that’s less than 30 minutes by train. Anyway, I’m not going to need your help tonight, so just go home like a good boy, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I refuse.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What? Are you planning to molest us!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Shut up, Mongolian Spot!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t have a Mongolian Spot! And when did you see my butt, anyway!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t leave two young girls here alone! Minors need guardians!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But Okarin’s a minor too!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll be 20 in less than a year and a half. In other words, Steins Gate has decided that I am an adult.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m pretty sure that makes you a minor just like us.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Chris-chan? I don’t think Okarin would do anything bad.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I mean, we’ve been together for more than ten years, and he hasn’t molested me once.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But he took you hostage, didn’t he?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup♪ Actually, I’m still his hostage.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We should kick him out of the room.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Haa...”[%p]
I sigh deeply and place a hand on my forehead.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You disappoint me, Christina.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This lab is a place of science. We are above such petty concerns as sex. If you must speak of these vulgarities, then I’ll have to ask you and your Mongolian Spot to leave!”[%p]
Looks like that was enough to convince Kurisu.[%p]
She gives me a “fine, fine” gesture as she returns to the development room.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah. So Christina really does have a birthmark on her bu--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“NO!”[%p]
After working on the PhoneWave (name subject to change) for about an hour, I head to a convenience store to buy dinner.[%p]
Daru hasn’t shown his face at all today. He must be busy with that part-time job.[%p]
I still don’t know what he’s doing, exactly.[%p]
Probably something that utilizes his super hacka skills.[%p]
I just hope he steers clear of the law.[%p]
While walking, I skim @channel on my phone.[%p]
Titor hasn’t shown up lately.[%p]
I think it’s been a week since his last appearance.[%p]
I’ve been reluctant to contact him ever since he called me the Messiah in his last email.[%p]
That was about the same time he stopped posting.[%p]
Now @channel’s denizens are busy slandering Titor. The majority opinion is that he ran away.[%p]
I wonder where Titor went.[%p]
I tried emailing him the other day, but he hasn’t replied.[%p]
His disappearance is especially worrying now that I think he might be Suzuha’s dad.[%p]
I need to contact him somehow.[%p]
Just then, a mail arrives.[%p]
No sender name. The address is... one I’ve seen once before.[%p]
...I’ve got a bad feeling about this.[%p]
I pause and take a look around. Then I swallow my fear and open the mail.[%p]
It feels as if a cold hand stroked my spine.[%p]
I hug myself, shuddering at the sight.[%p]
I delete the email immediately.[%p]
It’s happening again.[%p]
This is bad.[%p]
Really bad.[%p]
This is a threat.[%p]
Was it sent by the Organization? By SERN?[%p]
Does SERN know what we’ve been doing?[%p]
Should I report it to the police?[%p]
Wait, I can’t. I just deleted it.[%p]
And in any case, a picture alone probably isn’t enough to get the police involved.[%p]
Still, maybe I should talk to someone. But who?[%p]
Not the girls. I can’t worry them with this.[%p]
I’m the adult here, after all.[%p]
What about Moeka?[%p]
No. She may be a lab mem, but she’s been acting weird lately.[%p]
Even if I tell her about this, she won’t be any use.[%p]
Suzuha... has her father to worry about.[%p]
I guess that leaves Daru.[%p]
I need to find out whether SERN has discovered our hacking.[%p]
What would SERN do if they did find out, I wonder?[%p]
They wouldn’t have us killed, would they?[%p]
Despite my efforts to convince myself that this is just a prank, my feet hurry me back to the lab.[%p]
I burst into the lab gasping for air and quickly lock the door behind me.[%p]
Finally, I can catch my breath.[%p]
But just then, I realize that something’s wrong.[%p]
Mayuri and Kurisu aren’t here.[%p]
Did they go home?[%p]
No, their bags are still here.[%p]
The lights are still on.[%p]
The door.[%p]
When I entered just now, it was unlocked.[%p]
Would they be so careless?[%p]
The memory of that threatening email fills me with fear.[%p]
Don’t tell me. Were they kidnapped!?[%p]
Who took them?[%p]
The Organization?[%p]
SERN!?[%p]
And then I hear a noise.[%p]
Is that the shower?[%p]
The lab has a shower inside the dressing room.[%p]
There’s no bath -- we can’t afford such luxuries -- and it’s too small to fit more than one person inside.[%p]
Now I hear the sound of water running.[%p]
I recall the famous scene from Hitchcock’s Psycho.[%p]
No![%p]
Fresh blood, mixing into the water and flowing down the drain.[%p]
The corpses of two girls, sprawled out naked on the tile.[%p]
The second those images flash through my head, I slam open the door to the shower room.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is everyone okay!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Kyaaa! What are you doing!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hyah! No peeking, Okarin!”[%p]
Through the steam, I see the wet, naked bodies of the two girls.[%p]
Mayuri squats down,[evaluate expr="280AA3E814210000"] while Kurisu bashfully twists her body, trying desperately to hide her unmentionables.[%p]
Are their faces red because of the heat? Or...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Phew. You’re still alive.”[%p]
I wipe the cold sweat off my brow and sigh deeply.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t scare me like that. What are you guys doing packed into that tiny shower anyway?”[%p]
Kurisu shoots me a deadly glare.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Get out, you perv!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whoa!”[%p]
I dodge a bar of soap aimed at my face, then quickly flee the dressing room.[%p]
Well... I suppose that was all my fault.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s sad... I feel kinda dirty....”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re gonna regret this! I’ll never forgive you!”[%p]
Dammit. It was just a small misunderstanding.[%p]
I mean, why the hell did they decide to take a shower -- together! -- when they knew I was coming right back? It’s like they wanted to be seen.[%p]
Kurisu, especially. After all that talk about not wanting to spend the night with me around, she sure dropped her guard awfully fast.[%p]
They’re just lucky it was me who walked in on them. What if it had been the Organization?[%p]
They need to get serious. We’re fighting for our lives here.[%p]
...By the way, I didn’t see a Mongolian Spot on Kurisu’s butt. Naturally.[%p]
Anyway, how much longer are they going to shower?[%p]
Looking at the clock, it’s already been more than 15 minutes since I got back.[%p]
They were yelling at me a few minutes ago, but now I hear laughter and happy squeals coming from the shower room.[%p]
Sounds like they’re having a good time...[%p]
They get along almost like sisters.[%p]
[margin top="152"]“Wow! Chris-chan, you’re so slim!”[%e]
[margin top="114"][margin left="120"]“But Mayuri, your breasts are so big. I’m jealous.”[%e]
They’re checking each other out, aren’t they!? Muhahaha![%p]
In my head, I call up the memory of what I saw in the shower.[%p]
Wet hair. Beads of water glistening on their soapy skin. Round, full treasures hidden by conveniently placed steam...[%p]
I put my phone to my ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. We have a problem. I’m under attack from the Mongolian Spot and Ditzy sisters. They’re going directly after my sanity, a bold move against the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is the strongest offensive I’ve encountered so far. I realize now that vulnerability itself can be a powerful weapon. They’re pulling out all the stops, and I don’t think my pants can take it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Give in to the temptation? Nonsense. I could never do that. They’re fellow lab members, my loyal assistant and my childhood friend.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Must I? Is it truly the will of Steins Gate that I give in? That I raise my hand against my closest companions? If so... then how cruel the fates be!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“El... Psy... Kongroo!”[%p]
After a moment to collect myself, I put away my phone.[%p]
...I need some air.[%p]
