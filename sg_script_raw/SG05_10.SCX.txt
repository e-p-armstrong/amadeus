Two days have passed since Kurisu and Mayuri came to stay.[%p]
During that time, Daru and I have done our best to support Kurisu’s work on the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
According to Daru, it should be easy to use the LHC to generate black holes for our use.[%p]
The black holes form at the proton collision point -- where the lifter is installed -- and exist for only a few seconds before evaporating.[%p]
During those few seconds, SERN throws a human into the singularity.[%p]
We’ll use those few seconds too.[%p]
The gravity of the black hole compresses matter to infinite density.[%p]
SERN uses the lifter to keep the compression under control, but we don’t want that.[%p]
We’re going to dial SERN’s lifter down. Not so much that it endangers the world, of course, but enough to compress our memory data to under 36 bytes.[%p]
Daru has been coding the necessary program.[%p]
As for me, I’ve been searching for [color index="A0140000"]our[color index="800000"] lifter, the unknown device that pumps electrons into the PhoneWave (name subject to change) and keeps our black hole open.[%p]
Kurisu couldn’t find anything that could serve as a lifter inside the microwave, so it must be something on the outside.[%p]
We’re not sure what that could be, and so far we have no idea where to start looking.[%p]
Yesterday, I consulted Daru about that threatening email.[%p]
But Daru insisted that there’s no way SERN could have discovered his hacking yet.[%p]
Of course, I had him make doubly sure we hadn’t been tracked. His tests came back clean.[%p]
I understand he’s confident in his skills, and I trust him.[%p]
If Daru says they haven’t found out, then they haven’t.[%p]
But somehow, knowing that does not ease my anxiety.[%p]
It’s Friday, and although we still haven’t solved the lifter problem, Kurisu is just about done with the time leap machine.[%p]
Naturally, that means it’s time for her to give me something else to worry about.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“For the final adjustments, we need to use the PhoneWave.”[%p]
I groan.[%p]
In other words, we have to cause the electrical discharge phenomenon.[%p]
There’s a risk involved.[%p]
A risk called Mister Braun.[%p]
As we know, the discharge phenomenon causes the entire building to shake. Last time, Mister Braun threatened to raise our rent if it happened again.[%p]
Kurisu and Daru look at me.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s up to you, Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Take care of it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In other words, you’re sending me to die.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Your sacrifice will allow us to complete the time leap machine.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Besides, you’re always the one who talks to the boss for us.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well maybe it’s time for you to put your lives on the line.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I can’t. That girl who works there hates me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Fine. But hear this. I will not die! Like the immortal phoenix, I will return, no matter how many times it takes!”[%p]
With that said, I head down to handle things with Mister Braun.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Don’t die. Okay?”[%p]
As I pass through the lounge, Mayuri looks up from her costume to see me off.[%p]
