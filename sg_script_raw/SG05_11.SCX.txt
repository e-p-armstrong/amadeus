When I step into the store, Mister Braun, Suzuha, and the chipmunk are watching some comedy show on the massive 42-inch CRT.[%p]
Watching TV at noon without a customer in sight. Looks like business as usual at the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“’Sup, Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
I raise my hand in response to Suzuha’s greeting.[%p]
The chipmunk -- Nae -- quickly hides behind her father when she sees me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see you’re as busy as ever.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Okabe! Buy a CRT.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No thanks. I’m not some kind of retro TV otaku. I’d rather buy an LCD.”[%p]
I look around the store as I answer.[%p]
...Huh. I just thought of something.[%p]
Like SERN’s Large Hadron Collider, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) must have some kind of electron feed to keep the black hole open. SERN calls this feed the ’lifter’.[%p]
We still haven’t figured out what that is, nor what could be acting as a substitute lifter in our time machine.[%p]
What if...[%p]
What if our lifter is somewhere in this shop?[%p]
Whatever it is must be in close proximity to the PhoneWave (name subject to change) -- it couldn’t work otherwise -- and the Braun Tube Workshop is located directly below the lab.[%p]
Could our lifter be a CRT?[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“You’ve been having a lotta girls over lately, haven’t ya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just the usual members.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I was over the other day.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Invite me next time, huh? I wanna talk to some young girls for a change.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Daddy, that’s dirty.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“N-no it isn’t! It’s, uh... marketing! Yeah, I’m looking for new customers!”[%p]
Check out this scary-looking guy trying desperately to explain himself to his daughter. Hilarious.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What do you mean, for a change? You talk to me every day.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re not young.”[%p]
Suzuha’s the same age as Daru and I, which makes her older than Mayuri or Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Did you say something, Okabe Rintaro?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Only the truth.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Nae, your father is happy as long as he has you. Okay?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Yup. I know. But don’t say dirty things anymore, ’kay?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“It’s a promise!”[%p]
Then he joins pinkies with his daughter.[%p]
Damn, Mister Braun, you’re way off character.[%p]
How does a guy like him produce a daughter like that?[%p]
Nae is one of the kindest, gentlest girls I’ve ever met.[%p]
I don’t know why she’s so afraid of me, though.[%p]
Anyway, I came here to explain that the building’s about to shake. How do I avoid having my head ripped off?[%p]
“How many more earthquakes do you think this building can handle?”[%p]
No, that’s way too obvious.[%p]
“An earthquake is coming! My magic eye, Reading Steiner, has seen it in the future. Escape while you still can!”[%p]
Yeah, that might work.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hey, did Shiina Mayuri stay over yesterday?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So... Makise Kurisu stayed too?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. They’re both upstairs.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh...”[%p]
Suzuha’s hostility towards Kurisu hasn’t abated.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And how are you doing?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you feeling better?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh. Yeah, I guess. The search continues.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Huh? What’s this about, part-timer?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m searching for my dad. I told you before, remember?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Oh, right. Go find her old man, Okabe.”[%p]
Why does he think he can boss me around?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph, naturally. Suzuha’s a fellow lab member. Leave it to us.”[%p]
Suzuha looks at me with a smile that shines through the gloom filling the store.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okabe Rintaro... we’re the same age, but sometimes you seem a lot older. You really know how to give people strength.”[%p]
That’s the first time anyone’s said that to me. It makes me kinda happy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh, of course. I am the great Hououin Kyouma!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“...”[%p]
The chipmunk cowers in terror as I unveil my madness. I can see tears pooling in her eyes.[%p]
I guess my aura is just too powerful for a grade-school girl to endure.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Okabe. Next time you scare Nae, I’ll kill ya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“S-sorry...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Come here a sec.”[%p]
Suzuha takes my arm and leads me away from the Tennoujis, who have gone back to watching TV.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I just want to say...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Be circumspect in your dealings with Makise Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
Circumspect? Why can’t she just say “careful” like a normal person?[%p]
Not that I’m one to talk.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This again? Aren’t you just being paranoid?”[%p]
Suzuha shakes her head firmly.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No. Her perniciousness has been proven.”[%p]
Perniciousness? Is she saying Kurisu is dangerous?[%p]
There’s something strange about the way Suzuha is talking, and it’s not just her fondness for uncommon words.[%p]
There’s something else. Something...[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Her genius is a threat. At heart, she only cares about her experiments.”[%p]
Suzuha’s eyes are hard, and her voice is as cold as ice. I can tell that she means every word she says.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Listen to me. She’s using you all.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Makise Kurisu is connected to SERN.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What!?”[%p]
No. That’s impossible.[%p]
SERN is our enemy. If Daru’s hacking is discovered, I have no doubt they will do everything in their power to destroy us.[%p]
How can Kurisu be connected to SERN?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re saying she’s a spy?”[%p]
Suzuha nods firmly.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The credit for inventing the time machine was hers.”[%p]
Again, Suzuha’s words sound strange to my ears, but I still can’t place my finger on why.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Don’t let your guard down.”[%p]
I don’t believe it.[%p]
I saw Kurisu’s anger when she learned what SERN had been doing.[%p]
She called their actions a betrayal of scientists everywhere.[%p]
How can someone with such a pure love of science be connected to SERN?[%p]
But if what Suzuha says is true...[%p]
Could she be the one who sent that threatening email?[%p]
I suspected Moeka, but...[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Kyah...”[%p]
Suddenly, the ground starts to shake.[%p]
Kurisu started the experiment!?[%p]
But I haven’t talked to Mister Braun yet![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn, it’s too soon!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“OKABE!”[%p]
Sure enough, veins on Mister Braun’s forehead swell in response to the shaking.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“How many times do I have tell you not to shake the building!? Cute girls or no, I ain’t letting you off. Your rent’s going up!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait, Mister Braun! This isn’t our doing! It’s an earthquake! My magic eye, Reading Steiner, predicted this would happen!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“An earthquake!? You think I’ll fall for that!?”[%p]
The shaking gets more intense, knocking over a CRT.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Braun tube-chan, no!!”[%p]
Crap. I can’t talk my way out of this one.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Okabe, you bastard!”[%p]
Mister Braun clearly wants to snap my neck like a twig, but he elects to protect his greatest treasure -- the 42-inch CRT -- instead.[%p]
He grabs the remote and switches it off, then grabs hold of the TV and hangs on for dear life.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Hauww...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Is it over?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Looks like it.”[%p]
Wait... it’s [color index="A0140000"]over[color index="800000"]?[%p]
I carefully step through the rubble and take the remote from the dazed Mister Braun’s hand.[%p]
I press the red power button.[%p]
The 42-inch CRT instantly comes to life. I stare at the image on the screen... and smile.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh... heh heh heh.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Muhaha. Muhahahaha! MUHAHAHAHAHA!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve done it! I’VE DONE IT! This is the lifter!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s so obvious! Why didn’t I see it before!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course... this must be the work of Steins Gate! It chose this moment for a reason!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“What the hell are you laughing about, Okabe? You’re scaring my daughter! I’m raising your rent, you hear!? And you’re paying for that CRT!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A little silence please, Mister Braun! This is a most glorious moment, for I have just been chosen as the ruler of all space and time! MUHAHAHAHAHA!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Guh!”[%p]
Stars explode behind my eyes as Mister Braun drives his fist into the top of my head.[%p]
The world spins. I struggle to get ahold of my shaken brain.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You... dare lay hands on the great...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Got somethin’ to say?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh... heh heh... well then, Mister Braun... put it on my tab!”[%p]
With that, I fly out of the workshop.[%p]
