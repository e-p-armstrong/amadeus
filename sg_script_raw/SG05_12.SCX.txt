I rub my head.[%p]
It hurts like hell.[%p]
Damn that Mister Braun. Did he really have to crack me so hard?[%p]
Maybe I should report him for assault.[%p]
Thanks to his brutality, I had to make a strategic retreat.[%p]
Fortunately, I did not emerge empty handed.[%p]
The extra ten thousand yen a month will hurt, but in exchange, I have acquired information essential to the success of my plan.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“All’s well that ends well! Muhahaha!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin! The building just shook. Are you okay?”[%p]
Mayuri and Kurisu appear in the second story window.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Looks like you really are unkillable.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh. I have seen the future, Christina. In three minutes, you will be on your knees praising my greatness!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t think so.”[%p]
I run up the stairs.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“How could you miss something so obvious?”[%p]
When I tell Kurisu about the 42-inch CRT downstairs, that is her first reaction.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why are you blaming me?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I’m not blaming you. I’m just disappointed that nobody, including myself, noticed.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We missed the forest for the trees.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“To summarize...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just now, when the PhoneWave (name subject to change) shook the building, the 42-inch CRT was on.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But when Mister Braun turned the TV off, the shaking stopped immediately.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The discharge was interrupted.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I put a banana in just to be sure. Nothing happened.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m glad. We shouldn’t waste food.”[%p]
Nobody replies to Mayuri’s off-point statement. We’re busy reading about cathode ray tubes on the Internet.[%p]
It doesn’t take long before we find something interesting.[%p]
A cathode ray tube has a component called an “electron gun,” which uses extreme heat and a strong [color index="820000"]electric field[color index="800000"] to accelerate electrons and turn them into a beam.[%p]
The electron beam striking the TV screen’s phosphor layer is what generates the picture.[%p]
An electron gun could certainly work as a lifter.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We’ve found the answer.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The electrons emitted by the 42-inch CRT are holding the PhoneWave’s black hole open.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And the discharge phenomenon is the result.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So the reason we can’t use the PhoneWave at night is because the Braun Tube Workshop’s closed?”[%p]
The Braun Tube Workshop doesn’t have especially strict business hours, but it’s usually open from around 11 AM to 7 PM.[%p]
That matches up perfectly with my observation that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) only works between noon and 6 PM.[%p]
The few instances it hasn’t worked during that timeframe can be explained by the TV being off.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But how can a cathode ray tube emit such a strong electron stream?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s not about having a strong electron stream. If stronger were better, SERN would’ve solved the lifter problem long ago.”[%p]
I see. So it can’t be too strong or too weak.[%p]
By freak coincidence, the 42-inch CRT’s electron gun appears to have exactly the right level of electron discharge.[%p]
That’s the only explanation.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Somehow, the conditions here were perfect to create a time machine. Frankly, it’s a miracle.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, Christina! Not a miracle!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is the choice of Steins Gate!”[%p]
Rather than glare at me as she has so many times in the past, Kurisu shoots me an exasperated smile.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Whatever it is, it worked.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Umm...”[%p]
Mayuri looks up from her costume with a question in her eyes.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So, um, what do we have to do to complete Super PhoneWave-chan?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Now that we’ve found the cause, there’s nothing left to hold us back.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We can safely conclude that time leaping is possible when, and only when, that television is on.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We should probably test it, right? And there’s still the final check of the PhoneWave to do.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re right. Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Go downstairs and turn that TV back on.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ha. Ha. Ha. That’s hilarious, Christina. Allow me to dub that...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mission: Impossible!”[%p]
I’m not going back down there. My head still hurts from last time![%p]
Next time, I doubt I’ll make it out alive.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Whatever. Just go already.”[%p]
Kurisu orders me with a sour look.[%p]
It’s like [color index="A0140000"]I’m[color index="800000"] the assistant here.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If anyone can do it, it’s you. You made an amazing discovery just now, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Assistant mine... have you finally recognized my greatness as a mad scientist?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Damn. That was harsh.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh, whoops. I was supposed to flatter him so he’d feel like going, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yes, you’re an amazing mad scientist.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s too late!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, now that we’ve found the lifter, the time leap machine is 99% complete.”[%p]
Kurisu’s expression suddenly turns serious, but I can see the hunger in her eyes and the flush of excitement on her cheeks.[%p]
She knows that we stand on the threshold of a new age in science, and she cannot resist the lure of the unknown.[%p]
She’s a true scientist. No doubt about it.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s your dream, isn’t it? To invent a time machine.”[%p]
Our dream...[%p]
I’ve never really thought about it that way.[%p]
But she’s right. My hands are shaking.[%p]
Not from fear of Mister Braun, but from excitement.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I will become the undisputed lord of time. With that power, I will shatter the System and Chaos will rule the--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe.”[%p]
Kurisu interrupts my speech.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I wasn’t asking Hououin Kyouma. I was asking Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
She spears me with her gaze.[%p]
I meet it head on.[%p]
After a few moments, I feel my mouth curve into a smile.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll do it. Leave it to me.”[%p]
With that, I head downstairs.[%p]
A cracked skull and an empty wallet are a small price to pay for science.[%p]
Kurisu and Daru send me off with applause for some reason.[%p]
Mayuri’s the only one who looks worried, but I pat her head in reassurance.[%p]
