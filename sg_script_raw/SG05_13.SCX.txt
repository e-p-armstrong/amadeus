When I get downstairs, Suzuha and the chipmunk are sitting side by side on the bench outside.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“’Sup.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“...”[%p]
Nae gives me a quick bow, then hides behind Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That shaking upstairs put the boss in a bad mood. Nae and I are waiting it out.”[%p]
Damn. Now I really don’t want to go in there.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Um... are you okay? Dad hit you pretty hard...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll have you know that my brain is more valuable than the Mona Lisa! Your father may have set humanity back a hundred years by wiping out my brain cells.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Such a regrettable loss.”[%p]
Suzuha clasps her hands in solemn prayer.[%p]
Uh, I’m not dead. Just my brain cells.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I’m sorry... Daddy did something bad...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Chipmunk... what a gentle heart you have!”[%p]
I can’t believe she’s Mister Braun’s daughter.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I suppose I share some of the blame. Your father and I are even.”[%p]
Nae smiles slightly at my words of comfort.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now then, Part-Time Warrior. I have a request of you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I need you to distract Mister Braun for about five seconds.”[%p]
Suzuha’s eyes start to shine.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You mean seduce him?”[%p]
She flexes her bicep for some reason.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Go on, touch it.”[%p]
She insists, so I poke it. It’s just as hard as her confidence suggests.[%p]
...She’s probably stronger than me.[%p]
But I don’t understand what flexing has to do with seduction.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nobody said anything about seduction. It doesn’t matter how you do it.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m not much of a warrior if I can’t handle that. Besides, you said you’d help me search for my father, right? I’m only returning the favor.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see. Then I leave it in your capable hands.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okey-dokey!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Suzuha? Don’t be mean to Daddy, okay?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ahaha! Don’t worry. I won’t be mean.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Indeed.”[%p]
I want to complain that he’s the one being mean, but I just said we were even, so I refrain.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Wait here, Nae.”[%p]
The chipmunk nods.[%p]
When we enter the store, we find Mister Braun cleaning up the pieces of the broken CRT.[%p]
When our eyes meet, another vein pops on his forehead.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“If you came to apologize, I’ll listen. But your rent’s going up, understand?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry about what happened. I overreacted.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“As a token of apology, my lab’s representative, Amane Suzuha, would like to present you with a gift.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Boss... get ready!”[%p]
With a vigorous shout, which in no way seems appropriate for seduction, Suzuha whips off her jacket and--[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yaah!”[%p]
Throws it into Mister Braun’s face.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Mwoah!?”[%p]
I can see her bra![%p]
No, wait! That’s not a bra, but a tight tank top that leaves her midriff bare.[%p]
Yet Suzuha shows no sign of embarrassment as she rushes Mister Braun. [%p]
She slips behind him, grabs her coat, and pulls it tight against his face.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okabe Rintaro, now’s your chance!”[%p]
Now wait just a second.[%p]
Is this your idea of seduction?[%p]
It looks like you’re trying to suffocate him![%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hurry!”[%p]
Mister Braun flails his arms, trying to escape Suzuha’s restraint.[%p]
There’s a huge difference in strength between the two. It’s only a matter of time before he shakes Suzuha off.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-well done, Warrior! Your heroism will be remembered!”[%p]
Realizing that the only choice is to go for it, I dash to the counter, grab the remote, and switch on the 42-inch CRT.[%p]
After about two seconds, an image appears on the giant screen.[%p]
At the same time, the ceiling starts shaking.[%p]
Kurisu activated the PhoneWave (name subject to change) with perfect timing.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Mmm, mmmmmhmh! Mhmhmhmhmhhmh![linebreak]MhmhhmhmhmmhmhmhhhhmmhmhmHmhm!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s shaking again, Okabe Rintaro. What’s going on?”[%p]
Did she really take off her clothes without knowing why?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re a lifesaver, Part-Time Warrior! If you can, keep him restrained for ten more seconds!”[%p]
During that time, I escape from the store.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“...”[%p]
Outside, Nae’s following earthquake drill procedure, crouching while protecting her head.[%p]
I ignore that and look up to the second floor.[%p]
At exactly the same time, Kurisu appears in the window and gives me a happy thumbs up.[%p]
But a second later, she blushes, shoots me a glare, and disappears inside as if nothing happened.[%p]
What’s with her attitude?[%p]
I’m risking my life here![%p]
In any case, the experiment was a success.[%p]
The 42-inch CRT was the key, as I suspected.[%p]
...Now, how do I explain this to Mister Braun?[%p]
I don’t want him to kick us out of the building.[%p]
Perhaps I shouldn’t have left it to Suzuha...[%p]
I timidly peek into the store to gauge the situation.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Come on, boss! Give me back my jacket!”[%p]
Suzuha is there, fidgeting in her tank top as Mister Braun glares down at her.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Shaddap. I’m confiscating this.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You pervert!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“You’re the pervert, throwing your shirt in my face like some kinda dancer. That was pretty kinky. Gotta remember to thank Okabe, after I kill him.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“K-kinky? Don’t say things like that... it’s gross...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Anyway, you can work like that for the rest of the day. Go stand out front and use that flat tummy of yours to attract customers.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ll tell Nae on you!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Hah! Who’s she gonna believe? You, or her old man?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Damn...”[%p]
...No problems here.[%p]
Suzuha’s seduction strategy worked... I guess.[%p]
Mister Braun... what a guy.[%p]
