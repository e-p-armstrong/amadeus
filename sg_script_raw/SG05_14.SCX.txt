A little while later, I’m lying on the sofa watching high school baseball.[%p]
Kumamoto and Aichi are locked in a fierce struggle for the playoffs.[%p]
Just then, the clack-clack of the sewing machine in the lounge suddenly stops.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin? Can you come here?”[%p]
She motions to me while holding the costume.[%p]
What does she want? I walk over to her.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Can you hold this for me? Spread it out like ’fwapp!’”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Mayu-shi, say ’fwapp’ again.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Fwapp!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I got a fwapp!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Stop it already, perv.”[%p]
I follow Mayuri’s directions and spread the costume out by the sleeves.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hmm...”[%p]
She inspects it from a few paces away.[%p]
It’s hard to believe, given her usual ditziness. but Mayuri is very serious about her art.[%p]
That’s why cosplayers value her costumes so highly.[%p]
The costume I’m holding now is custom-made for Lukako. I thought Lukako was against it, but I guess Mayuri managed to persuade her.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay. Thanks!”[%p]
Mayuri looks tired. She’s been working all night.[%p]
But that doesn’t dim the brightness of her satisfied smile.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Finished♪”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s done?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup. I finished before Chris-chan. We were racing.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You win, Mayuri. Congratulations.”[%p]
Damn you, assistant...[%p]
She treats me and Daru like garbage, but Mayuri gets the sisterly touch.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Actually, I’m just about finished too.”[%p]
Kurisu connects the two cords she’s holding.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Done.”[%p]
Celebration is in order.[%p]
...But nobody cheers.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s a tie...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Man, I’m tired... I want Faris-tan to comfort me...”[%p]
Honestly, I don’t feel like cheering either.[%p]
And it’s not because I’m tired.[%p]
We worked around the clock for three straight days to finish the time leap machine, but now that it is complete, I realize that part of me never truly believed it would happen.[%p]
I feel my enthusiasm cooling rapidly, the fire quenched by one stark question.[%p]
What do we do with it?[%p]
I look at Kurisu.[%p]
She, too, seems less than enthused. [%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We may have created a monster here...”[%p]
I look at the improved PhoneWave (name subject to change) again.[%p]
The biggest change is the headgear attached to the X68000.[%p]
It looks like something out of a low-budget cyberpunk movie. Fortunately, we don’t need nerve jacks or brain chips for it to work. You just put it on and let the sensors do the rest.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why don’t we decide what to call it first?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I vote Heavenly Express!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“PhoneWave 3rd Edition ver1.00.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Silly Hat PhoneWave-chan.”[%p]
No consensus.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You guys have too much free time.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Does that mean you’re abstaining from the vote?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Time Leap Machine.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s terrible.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“C-come on! Simple is best, right? I mean, that’s what Okabe’s been calling it for the past two days.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Looks like my assistant has zero naming sense.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t want to hear that from a chuunibyou headcase like you.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh-ho! So Makise-shi knows the word chuunibyou... I sense your otaku level is quite high.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I... heard it from a friend. I have no idea where it comes from!”[%p]
Hah! A baldfaced lie.[%p]
She should just confess to being an @channeler.[%p]
Kurisu meets my grin with an icy glare.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s up to you, Mayuri. Choose one.”[%p]
Whenever the lab is divided on a name, the right to decide belongs to Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hmmm...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I think Time Leap Machine is fine.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Silly Hat PhoneWave-chan is super close though...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Somehow I knew she’d say that.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Like I said, simple is best. Mayuri gets it.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe!”[%p]
I want to object, but it’s an unwritten rule not to complain once Mayuri’s made a decision.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Very well. Time Leap Machine it is.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Assistant! Explain for us all how the Time Leap Machine works.”[%p]
I know the basics, but I want to hear details.[%p]
Kurisu nods and stands in front of the whiteboard.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In short, this device converts memories to data and sends them to the past.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Let’s begin with what we all know. By freak coincidence, the PhoneWave is able to produce ring singularities, much like John Titor’s time machine.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Through the ring singularity, we are able to send up to 36 bytes of data to the past.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The signal can only be received by phones. While that does limit the range of effect, it also removes an element of uncertainty from the equation.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Unlike D-Mails, memory data is sent in the form of a phone call, so we will be using a phone number, not an email address, to set the destination.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The ring singularity is made naked and stable by a device known as a lifter. In our case, that’s the 42-inch CRT downstairs.”[%p]
She’s explained the basics. Next, she’ll explain the modifications she made to turn the PhoneWave (name subject to change) into a time leap machine.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The PhoneWave now has headgear attached.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This headgear records the nerve impulses in the temporal lobe of the brain -- specifically, the [color index="820000"]CA3[color index="800000"] region of the hippocampus, where memories are stored.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then, using VR technology, we encode the nerve impulses into electrical signal data.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It comes out to approximately 3.24 terabytes.”[%p]
3.24 terabytes... It’s less than I expected. We’re talking about the entirety of a person’s memories.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“By the way, we’ll set it up so that the data decodes automatically after a certain amount of time.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anybody well versed in programming can do this. I had Hashida make the code.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, next we send the memory data through the net to the LHC in France.”[%p]
This building has a direct line to SERN for some reason, so we can transfer data at insanely high speeds.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How long does it take to send 3.24 terabytes of data?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We have 64 direct lines in parallel. So if we send it in 64 parts...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It should upload in about 45 seconds.”[%p]
That’s... pretty fast.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Next, we hijack the LHC, create a mini black hole, and use that black hole’s supergravity to compress the data into 36 bytes.”[%p]
3 terabytes is about 3 trillion bytes. Compressing that into just 36 bytes...[%p]
That’s one hell of a squeeze.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Will the compression take long?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s practically instantaneous. 23 milliseconds or thereabouts. We’re using a black hole, after all.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“By the way, the compression only holds in the immediate vicinity of the black hole. Once the data leaves that area, it will begin to decompress on its own.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This, too, takes 23 milliseconds.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It has to make it back to the X68000 and into the PhoneWave within that window.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s only 36 bytes. Shouldn’t be a problem.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Continue, Christina.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“While the data is being compressed, we use the PhoneWave to generate a Kerr ring singularity. When the electron discharge phenomenon occurs, we take the 36-byte data, patch it in...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And send it to the past.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This part is just like a D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The data travels to the specified time, where it arrives at the recipient’s phone.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“By now, 23 milliseconds should have passed, so the data will be fully decompressed.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Next, the decoding program runs, converting the data back into nerve impulse signals.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“These signals are discharged from the phone’s earpiece at approximately 0.02 amperes, a pretty weak charge.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If the recipient has the phone to his ear, they should go straight into his brain.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Assuming he answers his phone.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If he doesn’t, the transfer fails. Fortunately, we lose nothing but that copy of the memory data.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why a phone call instead of an email?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Because we need the recipient to put the phone to his ear. Otherwise the signals won’t reach his temporal lobe.”[%p]
She indicates the side of her head.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In this area you have the frontal lobe and temporal lobe of the brain. As I explained before, the hippocampus, where memories are stored, is inside the temporal lobe.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The phone sends out electrical impulses that pass through the temporal lobe and into the hippocampus, overwriting the recipient’s memories.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“At the same time, the phone sends impulses that stimulate the frontal lobe as well. This is important.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Remember that the frontal lobe is responsible for sending retrieval signals to the temporal lobe. This is how you remember things.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“By stimulating the frontal lobe, we force it to send retrieval signals keyed to the new memory data.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thus, the recipient recalls all of those memories as if they were his own.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Which, of course, they are, or will be in the future.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This happens in less than a second.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Now the recipient has the same memories as the sender. The time leap is complete.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If the data came from one week in the future, the recipient will ’remember’ that week as if he experienced it firsthand.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We need to be aware that consciousness and personality aren’t transferred. Both of those depend on the recipient.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Explain it with boobs.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“B-boobs!?”[%p]
Kurisu dissolves into a blushing, stammering mess. Looks like it’s up to me to answer Daru’s question.[%p]
Not with boobs, obviously.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s say we send your memories to you in grade school.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Right now, you’re some kind of omnisexual pervert who thinks inanimate objects are hot. But in elementary school, you were still an innocent child.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I was a boring little bastard who did nothing but study, what of it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Basically, that little bastard would suddenly have all your perverted memories, but his personality wouldn’t change.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not like you’ll become that famous anime detective with ’the looks of a child and the brains of an adult’.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What? That sucks.”[%p]
This isn’t like the time-leaping you see in sci-fi novels. We aren’t yet capable of transferring personality and consciousness.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ahem.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Um, since you need a phone to receive the signal, you can only send memories to the times you had one.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We also need to make sure that the sender and recipient are the same person.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If someone besides your past self -- your parents, or a friend, for instance -- answers the phone, then the nerve impulse signals will be projected into their brain instead.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If that happens, your memories could overwrite theirs, which could obviously cause serious damage to their psyche.”[%p]
Kurisu ends her explanation and takes a short breath.[%p]
The lab falls into silence.[%p]
I exchange glances with Kurisu and Daru.[%p]
I look at Mayuri, but her expression is blank. I guess it was too complicated for her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So.”[%p]
I clear my throat. It’s time for the million dollar question.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do we do with it?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Do with what?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The Time Leap Machine, of course. What do we do with it?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
For once, my assistant has nothing to say.[%p]
I already know that she fears we’ve created a monster. Honestly, I feel the same way.[%p]
After a few moments, Kurisu finally speaks.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s too much for us to handle, that’s for sure. The safest thing would be to hand it over to the government for professional research.”[%p]
I can tell that she’s not pleased to have reached this conclusion. She obviously would prefer to experiment with this technology.[%p]
After all, it’s humanity’s first time machine. We’ve finally taken our first steps towards godhood.[%p]
I’m sure that the nations of the world would pay billions for just one look at our machine.[%p]
The possibilities that it represents are limitless.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It just doesn’t feel real.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii doesn’t get it...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s ’cause you didn’t work on it, Mayu-shi.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, right. Ehehe!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What about you, Okabe? And I mean you, not Hououin Kyouma.”[%p]
I agree with Kurisu that the Time Leap Machine is dangerous.[%p]
On the other hand...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I want to experiment.”[%p]
I state my honest feelings.[%p]
Kurisu gasps.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But there are still questions we need to answer.”[%p]
This is unknown territory -- not just for us, but for all of humanity.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Who will time leap?”[%p]
I look to each of the lab mems in turn.[%p]
Daru quickly looks away.[%p]
Mayuri’s expression is blank.[%p]
Kurisu... stares right back at me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...It’s hard to choose.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ll pass.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Not a single person here wants the honor of being history’s first time traveler.[%p]
Everyone -- except for Mayuri -- is probably thinking about what could go wrong.[%p]
What if the time leap were to fail?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s not like SERN’s time machine. The possibility of becoming a jellyman is zero.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This machine sends data, not the real thing.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t let your preconceptions influence your decision.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You might say it’s like a cut-and-paste of your brain.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Actually, it’s more like a copy-paste. And it’s just your memories.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The original doesn’t get erased.”[%p]
That’s a very easy to understand example.[%p]
But that’s not the problem.[%p]
Time flows in a straight line from past to present to future. At least, that’s how most humans see it. This raises several questions.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What if there’s an error somewhere, and the data itself gets fractalized?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s say I send my memories an hour into the past.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“My memories would be replaced by fractalized data. In other words, data full of tiny holes.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Couldn’t that cause memory loss?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I suppose.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“One hour later, we arrive once again at the present. At that time, the me who lost his memories an hour ago and the current me conflict in my brain.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Which data set survives?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Logically, the present should change as soon as you send your memories to the past.”[%p]
The conflicting “current me” disappears, then.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So then it’s not a copy-paste at all, is it?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t know. No one’s ever experienced time travel before.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When we send a D-Mail, the world is reconstructed based on the change we made to the past.”[%p]
I’m the only one who’s aware of this, however.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We don’t know what happens when you time leap.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If it’s the many-worlds interpretation like Titor said, then the instant you time leap, it creates two possibilities -- one where you shift to another worldline, and one where you travel back in time on the same worldline.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Of course, there must also be a worldline where the current you doesn’t disappear. That would likely correspond to the present that we are experiencing right now.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“???”[%p]
But that’s only if the many-worlds interpretation holds in the first place.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I thought you didn’t believe what Titor had to say.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m talking hypothetically. Titor doesn’t matter right now.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If it’s the [color index="820000"]Copenhagen interpretation[color index="800000"], then every possible state propagates through space as a [color index="820000"]wave function[color index="800000"]. When a particular state is observed, the remaining states collapse and that state is fixed.”[%p]
But precise observation is impossible.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The problem is who the observer is in this case.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wouldn’t it be a third party? Like me, or Mayu-shi.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Not necessarily. It might be me. It might be someone else. It could even be God.”[%p]
To begin with, the Copenhagen interpretation and the many-worlds interpretation are both micro-scale theories used to explain quantum interactions.[%p]
No one knows whether they can be applied to humans, or to the world at large.[%p]
What about my personal experiences with Reading Steiner?[%p]
If Reading Steiner is the sort of power I think it is, then the “worldline” model is correct.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In the end, we arrive at the question of ’where is the self?’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This Time Leap Machine only sends memories. That, I guarantee.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Won’t the present be reconstructed at the moment of transfer?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s what happens with Okarin’s Reading Steiner, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That makes sense where D-Mails are concerned. When we send a D-Mail, we’re obviously interfering in past events.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But time leaping is different. All you do is send your memories to the past, which isn’t the same thing as sending a targeted D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whether the me who suddenly ’remembers’ one hour into the future will, in fact, change the past is something we can’t know until it happens.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m getting confused.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It sounds like we’re talking about the soul. Isn’t that a religious question?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wait. You guys are misunderstanding something.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“One hour isn’t enough time for your personality to change. You should be the same person one hour ago that you are now.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The only difference is that you’ll have an extra hour’s worth of memories.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How can you be sure?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Well, I can’t. Nobody’s tried it before.”[%p]
This discussion’s going nowhere.[%p]
Personality and consciousness can’t be strictly defined, so it’s hard to imagine what might happen.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So, which is it?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We don’t know. We can argue the theories all we want, but in the end, we can only guess.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This experiment may end up shattering preconceptions scientists and philosophers have held for centuries.”[%p]
We won’t know until we try. That pretty much sums it up.[%p]
To make matters worse, the subject must be prepared to risk damage to their psyche.[%p]
Kurisu, Daru, and I say no more.[%p]
We can’t solve this problem.[%p]
This is our limit as scientists.[%p]
But haven’t we accomplished enough already?[%p]
The Time Leap Machine itself is worthy of a Nobel Prize. We could sell this technology for billions, if we so chose.[%p]
And if we go public with the Time Leap Machine, we can break SERN’s monopoly on time travel technology.[%p]
That’s enough. It has to be.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey...”[%p]
Mayuri, who has been observing the discussion with glassy eyes, opens her mouth to speak.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, I have an idea...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Why don’t we make a banana time leap instead?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh Mayuri...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Bananas don’t have brains like people do.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh... you need a brain, huh...”[%p]
Mayuri never changes.[%p]
The atmosphere in the room gets a little more relaxed.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s not experiment.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’ll entrust the Time Leap Machine to a suitable research institution. Then we’ll announce it to the world.”[%p]
Thanks to the lightening of the mood, I can finally say what was on my mind.[%p]
Neither Kurisu nor Daru objects.[%p]
