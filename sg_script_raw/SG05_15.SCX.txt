No one has touched the Time Leap Machine since that discussion.[%p]
Ridiculous as it sounds, I can’t shake the feeling that it might suck my memories out and fling them into the past.[%p]
Oh, the machine does have its appeal, of course.[%p]
We’re all tempted by the idea of becoming humanity’s first “time leapers.”[%p]
Yet the fear of what could happen won out in the end.[%p]
Perhaps as a way to forget our fears and move on, we decide to hold a celebration to mark the completion of the device.[%p]
Everyone feels the need to let loose after working so hard on the project.[%p]
I have Daru order pizza while Kurisu and I go shopping for snacks.[%p]
Akiba has always had a lack of supermarkets. That hasn’t changed even with the anime stores gone.[%p]
After we finish shopping, Kurisu and I walk along the evening streets.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
She looks like she’s got something to say.[%p]
She keeps stealing glances at me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you upset?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Upset?”[%p]
She frowns, like she didn’t expect that question.[%p]
Finally, she faces this way.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“About our decision not to attempt a Time Leap experiment.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No, I’m not upset.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Humans are temporal beings.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s a Heidegger quote.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I was actually relieved when you made the decision not to use the machine.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you hadn’t been there, I might not have been able to stop myself.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thank you.”[%p]
What’s this? Gratitude?[%p]
Does she have a fever?[%p]
I put my hand to her forehead to check. Kurisu twitches.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Uh, what are you doing?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re talking like an assistant for a change. I thought you might have a fever.”[%p]
I drop my hand.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m not grateful to you or anything, okay!?”[%p]
Her voice is louder than it should be, and several people glance at us.[%p]
Kurisu blushes and hangs her head.[%p]
If Daru were here, he’d probably get all excited and say, “A real tsundere, sweet!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway.”[%p]
Kurisu clears her throat and returns to her usual sour expression.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That ’thank you’ was just a formality. Don’t get me wrong, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course. I only did what I had to.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am the founder of the Future Gadget Lab, Hououin Kyouma. My first priority is to protect the welfare of my lab mems.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So I have no need for your thanks.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And yet you always talk about plunging the world into chaos.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You are my allies, and the world is my enemy.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m speechless. You’re too self-righteous.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You say ’speechless,’ yet you’re speaking?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t argue semantics.”[%p]
It’s quite mysterious, really...[%p]
It’s only been two weeks since Kurisu and I met.[%p]
And yet it already feels natural for us to be walking together, exchanging banter like this.[%p]
Perhaps pooling our efforts to create something new -- dangerous though it may be -- has brought us closer together.[%p]
I admit that her knowledge and skills are impressive.[%p]
I’d like her to remain at the lab if at all possible, but she said she’s going back to America this month. It’s already the 13th, so I wonder when she plans to return.[%p]
I decide to ask her.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh yeah, I forgot to get a plane ticket.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I got too caught up in improving the PhoneWave.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Going public with the Time Leap Machine will send the world into an uproar. We also plan to expose SERN, remember? You may not be able to go back to America for some time.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I guess you’re right. I should call Mama and let her know.”[%p]
Looks like things are going to get busy.[%p]
Naturally, I want Kurisu to stay with us to the end.[%p]
A little bit after we return to the lab, Mayuri gets back. [%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪ I’m back!”[%p]
Seems Mayuri went to Lukako’s.[%p]
Suzuha shows up a few minutes later, and our [color index="820000"]development council[color index="800000"] comes to order.[%p]
Daru ordered three pizzas.[%p]
We also line up all the snacks we bought on the table.[%p]
It’s just like the party we had a few days ago to cheer up Suzuha.[%p]
Mayuri wanted to decorate the room, but since everyone’s tired, I dismissed it as unnecessary.[%p]
Looks like Suzuha managed to retrieve her jacket from Mister Braun.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Man, that was terrible. I was stuck looking like an exhibitionist all day.”[%p]
The Braun Tube Workshop’s closed. Suzuha made sure the 42-inch CRT was turned off, so there’s no need to fear any malfunction from the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
A heavy sigh escapes my throat. I realize that I’ve been tense and nervous since the Time Leap Machine was completed. Now I can finally relax.[%p]
The topic of the Time Leap Machine has become taboo. Even Kurisu doesn’t bring it up during the meeting.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, why did you order the exact same pizza as before!?”[%p]
I open the pizza boxes to find the exact same ones he got for Suzuha’s party.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Because I like it.”[%p]
Naturally, I’m not amused.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin, Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I called Feris-chan and Luka-chan, but they said they couldn’t come.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh. Do they have plans?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Feris-chan has a RaiNet tournament.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Crap, I should’ve gone to cheer! How careless of me!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And Luka-chan seemed embarrassed for some reason.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Maybe she thinks you’ll make her wear a costume again.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You still haven’t convinced her to cosplay?”[%p]
Then what was the point of completing the costume?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“She said it was embarrassing. I keep telling her ’Cuteness is Justice’, but she never listens.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Cuteness is Justice’... is that what they say?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’re cute too, Chris-chan!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hah? Eh?”[%p]
Kurisu doesn’t know how to react. She blushes, and Mayuri starts teasing her like a drunk old man.[%p]
There’s no alcohol at this party, of course.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, ComiMa’s coming up. Wanna go?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I can’t make something new, but I have a costume of Post-Awakening Seira from Blood Tune I made last year. I think the size is just right for Chris-chan too.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Me, cosplay?”[%p]
Kurisu looks conflicted. Then she murmurs--[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m sorta interested.”[%p]
She sure could have fooled us before, pretending to have no interest in otaku culture.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But I refuse to do it in public, though.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You don’t have to show anyone, but eventually, you’ll want them to see. The cosplay demon compels you!”[%p]
The... cosplay demon?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That reminds me. Chris-chan, you’re always wearing that cute uniform. What school is it from?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh, this?”[%p]
Kurisu lifts up her necktie.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I attended [color index="820000"]Ayamein[color index="800000"] for about two weeks. I modeled this outfit after their uniform.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh! Their uniform is really cute, but you made it even cuter! You might have really good design sense♪”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’ll bring the costume tomorrow, okay? Will you try it on then?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sure.”[%p]
Looks like Kurisu approves of the “Cuteness is Justice” philosophy.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“When’s the photo shoot?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Good to know you’re still a pervert, Hashida.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Come on, it’s Blood Tune’s Seira! She’s got ’panmoro’ going on!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Panmoro?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It means her panties are completely exposed!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“N-no way...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s okay♪”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You might not know this, but last year, there was a really popular saying.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“’They’re not panties, so it’s not embarrassing!’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s plenty embarrassing, trust me!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wear it, okay? It’s a promise!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Maybe you shouldn’t bother.”[%p]
Suzuha speaks, her tone sharp.[%p]
She’s scowling at Kurisu again.[%p]
Suddenly, the atmosphere in the room changes.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’re asking for trouble by trusting Makise Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What’s that supposed to mean?”[%p]
Naturally, my strong-willed assistant isn’t one to back down from a fight.[%p]
Sparks fly between the two girls.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ve been meaning to ask. Did I do something to you?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Not to me. But I know everything you have done.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What do you mean? I’ve done nothing to be guilty of.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Perhaps. But I know your true nature.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wow, you can see into my heart? That’s groundbreaking technology. I’d love to hear how it works.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s not science. It’s... a prediction.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So you’re just making it up.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I [color index="A0140000"]know[color index="800000"].”[%p]
Uh-oh, we’ve got a situation here.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin.”[%p]
Mayuri clings to me with teary eyes.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Stop them from fighting.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh... this looks like a job for the one and only Hououin Kyouma.”[%p]
I insert myself between the two girls.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Break it up, you two! I, Hououin Kyouma, shall decide this dispute!”[%p]
They both glare at me.[%p]
Although I’m afraid for my life, I harden my resolve. The mission must succeed.[%p]
First, I focus on Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Assistant! I didn’t raise you this way.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You didn’t raise me at all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you want to become a true mad scientist, you must learn to keep your emotions in check even as you cackle your way to victory!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Nobody asked you. And I’m already a scientist.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Next, I switch focus to Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Warrior! Your enemy is SERN, remember? You must conserve your strength for Ragnarok.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I warned you before, Okabe Rintaro. Makise Kurisu is a threat.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha--”[%p]
You’re going to mention that here? Now?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh? What’s this about, Okabe?”[%p]
Their eyes are like laser beams boring into my skull. I want nothing more than to flee for my life.[%p]
But Mayuri’s watching me anxiously. I need to defuse the situation.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“MUHAHAHA!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Looks like neither of you is willing to back down. So be it! Fight to your hearts’ content! Fight until there is no more fight to be had! Then, share a manly handshake by the river and let friendship blossom!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But in the future, when it comes time for you to venture out into the real world, I hope you remember one thing...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nobody likes a mood-killer!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu & Suzuha[line][center]”Shut up!”[%p]
Getting yelled at by both of them at the same time sends shivers down my spine.[%p]
It’s coming. I quickly seize my right arm.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gah! Why now, of all times!? Calm down, right arm of mine!”[%p]
I turn around and head back to Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry, Mayuri. At his rate, I’ll end up hurting those two. I have no choice... the rest is up to you...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Geez...”[%p]
Mayuri puffs her cheeks out and goes over to the two girls.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, guys? Mayushii doesn’t like it when you fight. Let’s all get along, okay?”[%p]
Hearing this, the two combatants reluctantly comply.[%p]
I expected this would happen. Mayuri is the oil that keeps the gears of this lab churning along.[%p]
The throbbing in my right arm dissipates.[%p]
