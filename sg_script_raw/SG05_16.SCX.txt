Daru comes over to chat with Suzuha, and gradually peace returns to the lab.[%p]
Kurisu is in the development room, making a call. Probably to her mother in America.[%p]
I sit on the sofa and watch TV while sipping Dr P.[%p]
The TV is running a game show where contestants guess the prices of popular items at high-class restaurants.[%p]
Mayuri sits down next to me.[%p]
She peels a banana and begins eating it.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hm?”[%p]
Mayuri slowly looks around the lab, smiling all the while.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s been really lively here these past few weeks, huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, I guess it has.”[%p]
I established the Future Gadget Laboratory around the time I entered college. It was the first step in my plan to bring chaos to the world.[%p]
That was around the middle of March this year, which means it’s been almost five months.[%p]
Not half a month after it was established, Mayuri showed up -- I’m still not sure why -- and became a lab mem.[%p]
For about a month, it was just me and Mayuri. Then, in early May, I finally got Daru to join. All it took was telling him that the lab is just a three minute walk from MayQueen+Nyan². [%p]
This location on the outskirts of Akiba has always been quiet.[%p]
Mayuri isn’t the type to object to every little thing like Kurisu, nor the type to make dumb jokes like Daru, so the lab was very peaceful back in those days.[%p]
It was quite a pleasant place to be.[%p]
And now the lab mem count has increased to eight. It happened in the blink of an eye, or so it seems.[%p]
They didn’t come today, but Lukako visits occasionally, and Faris is a familiar face at MayQueen+Nyan². Or at least she was before MayQueen disappeared.[%p]
I remember feeling out of place the first time I came to Akiba, but now, it’s like a second home.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s fun♪”[%p]
Mayuri, too, seems pleased by the increase in lab mems.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, now that there are eight lab mems, Mayushii thinks it’s getting a little cramped in here.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“First, we don’t have enough chairs.”[%p]
The sofa only has room for two.[%p]
Then there’s Daru’s personal desk chair.[%p]
Those are the only chairs in the lounge.[%p]
There are some pipe chairs in the development room, but they need to stay there.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“We should buy more. Do you have money, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“New chairs will take all my savings.”[%p]
Then I’d need to get a part-time job again.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I guess you can use some of my salary.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“We need a new microwave too. Otherwise, I can’t warm up my Juicy Chicken Number One.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, sorry about that.”[%p]
Cutting off Mayuri’s chicken supply might actually kill her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But Mayuri. When we turn over the Time Leap Machine, the reward money will solve all of our problems.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Will it be enough to pay for chairs and a microwave on top of the higher rent?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’ll be enough. More than enough.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow! That’s great, Okarin♪”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why are you so happy?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Just look. We’ve made so many friends.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“There’s Daru-kun, Chris-chan, Luka-chan, Suzu-san, Moeka-san, Feris-chan, Braun-san, Nae-chan, and more!”[%p]
She gazes wistfully into the distance.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“In the spring, when you started this lab, you seemed so lonely.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But now you’re fine.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You don’t need me to be your hostage anymore.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you--”[%p]
“What do you mean?” I try to ask, but before I can finish--[%p]
An urgent news bulletin appears on the TV.[%p]
The subtitles read “Terrorist bomb threat suspends Yamanote, Sobu, Keihin-Tohoku lines.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“A bomb threat?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hang on. Those lines all pass through Akiba. How is Mayu-shi gonna get home?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh yeah. I should call home.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
A bomb threat...[%p]
I don’t know why, but I’ve got a bad feeling about this.[%p]
Only the lines passing through Akihabara are suspended, as if that were the target.[%p]
Wait. Could that be it?[%p]
Could the bomb be at Akihabara Station?[%p]
I get a cold feeling in my stomach.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okabe Rintaro. I need to know.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’ve completed the Time Leap Machine, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh? Well, yeah...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okay.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I just remembered I’ve got something to do. I’m going out.”[%p]
Suzuha leaves the lab without another word.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What’s wrong with her?”[%p]
Suzuha’s acting strange.[%p]
Is it related to the bomb threat?[%p]
Why did she just ask about the Time Leap Machine?[%p]
Something occurs to me.[%p]
The two threatening emails I received...[%p]
“We’re watching you.”[%p]
“You know too much.”[%p]
Who sent them?[%p]
And there’s more.[%p]
Words and images flash through my head.[%p]
SERN.[%p]
The LHC.[%p]
Jellymen.[%p]
The Z Program.[%p]
Government secrets.[%p]
The Organization.[%p]
Men in black.[%p]
The Committee of 300.[%p]
The Time Leap Machine.[%p]
What did Kurisu say?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We may have created a monster here...”[%p]
Taken separately, each of these elements was insignificant.[%p]
But if I consider them part of a single line, they all point to one inescapable truth.[%p]
[color index="A0140000"]We’ve come too far.[color index="800000"][%p]
Fear seizes my heart in an icy grip. I can feel anxiety eating at my brain.[%p]
I can’t breathe.[%p]
Even though it’s hot and humid, my body shivers.[%p]
Should we run? Get out while we still can?[%p]
We can’t use the trains.[%p]
What about the subway?[%p]
Or would a taxi be better?[%p]
Nobody’s saying anything.[%p]
Nobody’s doing anything.[%p]
What should we do?[%p]
Suddenly, there’s a softness against my hand.[%p]
I look down to see Mayuri’s hand holding mine. When I look up, I see worry written on her face.[%p]
It’s okay.[%p]
I’m just being paranoid.[%p]
It’s all a coincidence.[%p]
Tomorrow, we’ll get rid of the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
Then we can forget that all of this happened.[%p]
Pretend it was just a dream.[%p]
We never invented a time machine.[%p]
I don’t need money.[%p]
As long as we can forget about today and welcome tomorrow.[%p]
We’ll be okay, won’t we?[%p]
But my anxiety doesn’t go away.[%p]
I look over Mayuri’s head at the entrance to the lab.[%p]
The door is unlocked.[%p]
Anyone could just waltz right in.[%p]
I hear sirens wailing a few streets away.[%p]
The bomb threat has Akiba in an uproar.[%p]
Yet here, in our corner of Akiba, it’s so quiet.[%p]
Mayuri squeezes my hand with her warm, slender fingers. I squeeze back.[%p]
