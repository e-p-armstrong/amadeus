The next thing I know, the door slams open.[%p]
Five men burst into the lab.[%p]
Their movements are swift and sure -- professional -- and each of them is carrying a gun.[%p]
They spread out just inside the door and aim their weapons at us.[%p]
It all happens so fast, no one has time to scream.[%p]
The men are foreigners, a mix of races, dressed casually in colorful shirts and shorts or jeans.[%p]
But their arms are thick with muscle, and their eyes are hard and cold as ice.[%p]
Two of them are holding pistols. The other three have assault rifles.[%p]
AK-47s in Akiba? Is this some kind of joke?[%p]
One thing is certain. These guys aren’t tourists.[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“Hands in the air. Nobody move.”[%p]
The dark-skinned, crew-cut man barks an order.[%p]
It feels like I’m dreaming.[%p]
Did I fall asleep watching an action movie?[%p]
This is the first time so many people have gathered in this room.[%p]
Suddenly, the lab feels small. What an odd thing to be thinking at a time like this.[%p]
The first to obey is Daru.[%p]
Then Kurisu raises her hands.[%p]
Then me.[%p]
Last is Mayuri.[%p]
Silence.[%p]
Time seems to grind to a halt.[%p]
The men say nothing, but their guns remain steady, muzzles pointed at us.[%p]
On the TV, a comedian laughs.[%p]
What is this?[%p]
Are we on candid camera?[%p]
Then I hear a new sound coming from outside.[%p]
The sound of high heels.[%p]
A woman is coming up the stairs.[%p]
Are these men waiting for her?[%p]
Is she their leader?[%p]
A squad of battle-hardened commandos lead by a beautiful woman. It’s like something out of a manga.[%p]
Nothing seems real.[%p]
Before long, the woman appears.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kiryu... Moeka...”[%p]
The part-time editor.[%p]
The mail demon, Shining Finger, who is never seen without her phone.[%p]
Lab Mem 005.[%p]
Moeka? She’s their leader?[%p]
The least imposing woman I’ve ever met?[%p]
Even now, she doesn’t meet my stare. Her eyes are aimed down at the floor.[%p]
What’s going on here?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um... Moeka-san?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“We’re taking the time machine.”[%p]
As always, her words are barely audible. [%p]
It’s ridiculous. Laughable.[%p]
And yet, I can’t laugh.[%p]
My heart is a jackhammer in my chest.[%p]
The inside of my mouth is drier than a desert.[%p]
I stay still, with my hands in the air.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Makise Kurisu, Okabe Rintaro, Hashida Itaru. The three of you will come with us.”[%p]
I don’t understand.[%p]
Why is Moeka here?[%p]
I don’t know, but I have to ask.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s going on here?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I can’t answer that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is a joke... right?”[%p]
Moeka shakes her head.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You don’t need to know.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You can’t resist.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Come with us.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-where?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
No reply.[%p]
She doesn’t intend to answer that either.[%p]
Dangerous.[%p]
These guys are dangerous. Look at their guns.[%p]
Nothing good can happen if we go with them.[%p]
I try to refuse, but my voice catches in my throat.[%p]
I can’t stop staring at their guns.[%p]
Are they real?[%p]
They’re not going to start shooting, are they?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m n-not going anywhere until you answer.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You can’t refuse.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You have nowhere to run.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“We have men stationed throughout Akihabara.”[%p]
Wait...[%p]
Something clicks in my head.[%p]
It was them. They sent the bomb threat. They stopped the trains.[%p]
Why?[%p]
To keep us here?[%p]
Just for that?[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I don’t want to hurt anyone.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“The three of you, come with us.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why...”[%p]
Kurisu, who has kept silent until now, finally opens her mouth.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why just the three of us?”[%p]
That’s when I realize that Mayuri wasn’t included in Moeka’s demand. She only wants Kurisu, Daru, and me.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’m not answering your questions.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Come with us. It’s your only choice.”[%p]
We’re not getting anywhere.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“O-Okarin...”[%p]
Daru’s voice is shaking. I turn my head to look at him. He’s deathly pale.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“D-don’t you think we should do what she says?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But unless she tells me the reason...”[%p]
Honestly, I have no idea what to do.[%p]
My heart is still fluttering in my chest. This seems more like a dream than reality.[%p]
I’m not a military otaku. I’ve never seen a real gun.[%p]
The black shine of their weapons looks somehow tacky. They lack the imposing feel you expect.[%p]
I’d believe her if she told me they were fake.[%p]
Mayuri suddenly speaks up.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“M-Moeka-san, you’re a lab mem too... aren’t you?”[%p]
It’s as if Mayuri asked my question for me.[%p]
Moeka was a strange woman, but I welcomed her as a lab mem all the same.[%p]
What is she thinking right now?[%p]
In answer...[%p]
Moeka pulls a gun from her belt and points it at us.[%p]
I realize that Moeka isn’t holding her phone. This is the first time I’ve seen her without it.[%p]
Not like that matters now.[%p]
Moeka’s gun hand is trembling.[%p]
Is the situation affecting her too?[%p]
It must be. She’s terrified of talking to people.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Our mission...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Is to silence you.”[%p]
Silence us?[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Your refusal to come will change nothing.”[%p]
Does that mean she plans to kill us?[%p]
Why? What did we do?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who sent you? Who are you people!?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“We...”[%p]
Moeka suddenly lifts her head.[%p]
For perhaps the third time since I’ve known her, she looks straight at me. Her eyes are dark and empty.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...are from SERN.”[%p]
SERN!?[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“M4!”[%p]
The dark-skinned man speaks up. Is he addressing Moeka?[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“Watch your tongue!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka hangs her head again.[%p]
In my head, I replay the words she just spoke.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]SERN.[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]They’re from SERN?[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]Why SERN?[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]Of course. Who else could it be?[%e]
[name]Moeka[line]“Come with us. Now.”[%p]
Moeka raises her voice in frustration.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“If you continue to resist, I’ll have to resort to extreme measures.”[%p]
Moeka slowly raises her gun.[%p]
She points the muzzle at...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
Mayuri.[%p]
My whole body instantly goes cold.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Shiina Mayuri is not needed.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stop!”[%p]
I lunge at Moeka, but the dark-skinned man is faster.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gah!”[%p]
Something strikes my chin with crushing force.[%p]
The shock numbs my entire body. Stars explode behind my eyes.[%p]
I fall to my knees, powerless to stand.[%p]
Everything goes dark.[%p]
What happened?[%p]
Did he hit me with the butt of his rifle?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
I look up.[%p]
Mayuri, face streaked with tears, is reaching out to me as if begging for help.[%p]
Over her shoulder, I see Moeka ready her gun.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Mayuri! No!”[%p]
I try to yell “Stop!” but my voice catches in my throat.[%p]
Nothing comes out but a pitiful wheeze.[%p]
Someone.[%p]
Anyone.[%p]
Please.[%p]
Stop her.[%p]
Stop Moeka![%p]
Moeka’s lips move.[%p]
She’s mumbling something.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“For SERN... for FB... for SERN... for FB...”[%p]
Her mouth opens and closes robotically.[%p]
My blood curdles. [%p]
No![%p]
A sharp, dry crack splits the air.[%p]
Time slows to a crawl.[%p]
Moeka pulled the trigger.[%p]
Blood spurts from Mayuri’s forehead.[%p]
It splashes across my face, wet and warm.[%p]
Her delicate, frail body falls towards me.[%p]
I catch her.[%p]
Her body is limp, like a puppet with no strings.[%p]
Her head and arms dangle lifelessly.[%p]
The smell of gunpowder fills my nose.[%p]
And then, the smell of blood.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wahhhhhhhhhhh!”[%p]
Daru clutches his head and falls to his knees, screaming at the top of his lungs.[%p]
The sound jerks me back to my senses.[%p]
In my arms, Mayuri takes one short, shallow breath.[%p]
And then...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“O...kari...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Mayuri?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No... no!”[%p]
She’s dead.[%p]
Mayuri’s dead.[%p]
Her face is covered in blood.[%p]
Her blood stains my hands.[%p]
It’s warm.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You three come with us. Now.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“No more warnings.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Resist, and we’ll kill you too.”[%p]
I hear a voice.[%p]
But I can’t comprehend what it’s saying.[%p]
What is this?[%p]
What’s going on here?[%p]
Is this a joke?[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]“We may have created a monster here...”[%e]
This is a dream, right?[%p]
...Right?[%p]
I feel nothing.[%p]
My mind is blank.[%p]
I shake Mayuri’s shoulder.[%p]
Mayuri?[%p]
Wake up, Mayuri.[%p]
You’ll catch cold if you sleep here.[%p]
If you’re tired, you can stay overnight.[%p]
Or I can take you home, if you prefer.[%p]
We’ll ride the train back to Ikebukuro together, like we used to before Daru joined, when it was just the two of us.[%p]
Memories of her smile whirl through my head, a thousand different smiles from a thousand different occasions.[%p]
If I look away, she’ll disappear.[%p]
She always disappears.[%p]
[margin top="532"][center]“But now you’re fine.”[%e]
[margin top="532"][center]“You don’t need me to be your hostage anymore.”[%e]
No, Mayuri. I still need you.[%p]
Laugh for me - “ehehe” - like you always do.[%p]
Greet me with your silly “tutturu♪”.[%p]
Tell me it’s a lie. Tell me you’re alright.[%p]
...[linebreak]...[linebreak]Mayuri?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah... AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!”[%p]
Red flames consume my mind, an inferno of rage and hate and rage and hate and the burning desire to kill everything I see.[%p]
I gently lay the motionless Mayuri on the floor.[%p]
I stand up.[%p]
And then I fling myself at Moeka.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe!”[%p]
But before I can take a step, someone grabs my hand from behind.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You can’t!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let me go! Let me go!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You can’t! They’ll kill you!”[%p]
Moeka’s gun is aimed at my head.[%p]
Her finger is already on the trigger.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You gonna kill me too!?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“If you resist.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Please, Okabe, do what she says. Okay?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Otherwise, they’ll kill you too.”[%p]
I tear my hand from Kurisu’s grip.[%p]
My vision is a tunnel with Moeka on the other side.[%p]
She won’t get away with this.[%p]
She killed Mayuri in cold blood.[%p]
I’ll do the same to her![%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No!”[%p]
Moeka pulls the trigger.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...!?”[%p]
The sound of the shot smites upon my eardrums.[%p]
I feel a sharp pain on the side of my head.[%p]
I nearly lose my balance again.[%p]
But I’m still alive.[%p]
What happened?[%p]
I realize that Moeka’s gun is lying at her feet. Beside it is a small stone.[%p]
Someone must have thrown it and knocked her gun aside.[%p]
[name]???[line]“Get down!”[%p]
[name]Attacker B[line]“Gweh!!”[%p]
Suddenly, Suzuha is there in the doorway, knocking one man down in the blink of an eye.[%p]
Before anyone can react, she darts into another man’s range and delivers a piercing elbow strike to his solar plexus.[%p]
The man drops to his knees, gasping for air.[%p]
The remaining men turn their guns on her, but she throws the incapacitated man towards them to block their aim.[%p]
She then slides into the feet of the man at the rear, tripping him forward, and in a single smooth, flowing motion, drives her knee into the man’s face as he falls.[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“Who the hell!?”[%p]
The dark-skinned man aims his rifle.[%p]
But before he can fire, Suzuha snatches a stunned attacker’s gun and shoots him.[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“Gwah!!”[%p]
Blood spurts from the man’s hand.[%p]
Without pausing, Suzuha leaps into the air and delivers a soaring roundhouse kick to his jaw.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Enough.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“!!”[%p]
The next thing I know, the five men are down, and Moeka’s gun is aimed at Suzuha’s face.[%p]
But Suzuha doesn’t back down. Her gun is trained on Moeka’s neck.[%p]
It’s a standoff. Neither moves.[%p]
Silence returns to the room.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Who are you?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“42.”[%p]
Suzuha’s reply makes no sense.[%p]
She glances at me.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“TV.”[%p]
What is she saying?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Turned on.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“What...”[%p]
Suddenly, Kurisu springs up and makes a break for the development room.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Don’t move!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s my line!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Tch.”[%p]
I suddenly realize the meaning of Suzuha’s words.[%p]
The 42-inch TV downstairs. It’s on.[%p]
She wants me to use the Time Leap Machine!?[%p]
I look at Mayuri’s body.[%p]
She’s lying there quietly.[%p]
Her eyes are closed.[%p]
They’ll never open again.[%p]
One of the men Suzuha knocked out starts to moan.[%p]
If they wake up, it’s all over.[%p]
Suzuha looks at me again.[%p]
Her eyes implore me to make my move.[%p]
If I use the machine, I can avert Mayuri’s death.[%p]
But at the same time, it could fry my brain.[%p]
Fry my brain? So what?[%p]
What is there to fear?[%p]
Mayuri is dead, shot in cold blood.[%p]
This isn’t right. I won’t accept it![%p]
Then change it.[%p]
Change the past.[%p]
You have the power. Use it![%p]
I stagger into the development room.[%p]
Kurisu is about to put on the headgear.[%p]
I pull it away from her.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m going back!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No! I should be the one to--”[%p]
I grab Kurisu’s wrist as she tries to take it back.[%p]
I stare into her eyes, eyes wet with tears.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I will save Mayuri!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But what if it fails!?”[%p]
I ignore her and put on the headgear.[%p]
Moeka’s last shot grazed the side of my head.[%p]
My ears are still ringing, and there’s blood on my neck.[%p]
It doesn’t matter.[%p]
I might fail. I might even die.[%p]
But I have to try.[%p]
It’s my only chance to save Mayuri.[%p]
Kurisu bites her lip and activates the X68000.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okabe Rintaro! One of them’s moving!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Get in there! Kill them!”[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“Damn... kids!”[%p]
The crew-cut man staggers into the development room.[%p]
Acting purely on instinct, I grab Future Gadget No. 4: Moad Snake from the shelf and flick the switch.[%p]
White smoke instantly fills the room, rendering it impossible to see.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Kill them!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Augh!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ugh, gh, Okabe!! Are you sure!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you sure about this!? Really!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do it, Kurisu! Activate the machine!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Agh!”[%p]
Pain flares in my right arm.[%p]
Was I shot?[%p]
It doesn’t matter.[%p]
I see blue-white light shining through the smoke.[%p]
The discharge is starting![%p]
The light rapidly grows brighter.[%p]
The floor begins to shake.[%p]
The singularity is open![%p]
I crouch down, holding the headset steady with one hand.[%p]
Wait for me, Mayuri![%p]
I won’t die here![%p]
I’ll cross through time to save you![%p]
Leap, my memories.[%p]
Leap to the past![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Leaaaaaaaap!!”[%p]
The world explodes into light.[%p]
