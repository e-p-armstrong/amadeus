[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Mayuri?”[%p]
No matter how many times I call her name...[%p]
Mayuri doesn’t answer.[%p]
Mayuri is standing in front of a grave, gazing at the sky.[%p]
The grave belongs to her grandmother, who died when Mayuri was eleven years old.[%p]
Her parents were always busy with work, so her grandmother was her only companion. [%p]
I was close to Mayuri’s family, so her death was sad for me too.[%p]
At the wake, I expected Mayuri to break down and cry.[%p]
She didn’t. Instead, she spent the whole time gazing vacantly at her grandmother’s memorial portrait.[%p]
Six months went by.[%p]
I had advanced to middle school, so Mayuri and I no longer commuted together.[%p]
But whenever I passed the cemetery on the way home, Mayuri would always be standing there.[%p]
Every day, rain or shine, she would stand for hours before the grave, staring wordlessly at the sky as if she could see her grandmother in heaven.[%p]
In her hands, an old pocket watch.[%p]
The watch had belonged to her grandmother. Mayuri always held it when visiting the grave.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri?”[%p]
No matter how many times I called her name, Mayuri did not answer.[%p]
Back then, Mayuri wouldn’t talk to anyone. Not to me, not even to her parents.[%p]
Whenever I saw her standing there, staring at the sky, I felt unease grip my heart.[%p]
Her gaze was so earnest, her intentions so pure, that I feared some power might grant her wish, and carry her off to heaven to join her beloved grandmother.[%p]
And so, to ensure that nothing like that happened, I made sure to stop by the cemetery every day.[%p]
I would stand next to the skygazing Mayuri, and call her name.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri?”[%p]
But no matter how many times I’d call her, Mayuri wouldn’t reply.[%p]
The only sound in the lonely cemetery was the echo of my voice, calling her name.[%p]
It was raining that day, too.[%p]
Mayuri had a light blue umbrella.[%p]
In contrast to the umbrella’s color, the sky was glazed gray, covered in clouds.[%p]
After a while, the rain stopped.[%p]
Rays of light shone through gaps in the clouds, a stunningly beautiful sight.[%p]
Rembrandt’s Rays, they are called, or sometimes the Angel’s Ladder.[%p]
Suddenly, a strong wind swept through the cemetery.[%p]
It caught Mayuri’s umbrella and carried it into the sky.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
Mayuri seemed not to notice. She kept staring at the sky.[%p]
And then, slowly...[%p]
So very slowly...[%p]
She stretched her hand out to the sky.[%p]
As if to grasp the rays of light.[%p]
As if her grandmother were reaching down to pull her up.[%p]
And then, she lifted herself on her toes.[%p]
To me, it looked as if she were floating up towards heaven.[%p]
Impulsively, I grabbed Mayuri’s outstretched hand and pulled her into my embrace.[%p]
In retrospect, my fears were just a childish fantasy, but at the time, I truly believed that Mayuri might vanish.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I won’t let you go.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I won’t let anyone take you away.”[%p]
I realized how embarrassing the words coming from my own mouth were.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re my hostage now. My guinea pig!”[%p]
It was the first excuse that came to mind.[%p]
Before her grandmother died, Mayuri and I were fans of a popular TV series about costumed heroes battling evil.[%p]
I particularly admired the villain, a mad scientist. I even got pretty good at mimicking his lines.[%p]
Now I was doing it to hide my embarrassment.[%p]
I could feel my face growing red, but I kept up the mad scientist act all the same. If nothing else, it was better than admitting my insecurities.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“T-there is no escaping me! Muhaha, muhahaha!”[%p]
As I said this, I realized that Mayuri was shaking.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh... sniff...”[%p]
She whispered. It was the first time in six months that I had heard her speak.[%p]
Her voice was choked with tears.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s your hostage...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I guess I’m stuck here, huh? Ehehe...”[%p]
She smiled happily.[%p]
Tears fell from her eyes.[%p]
And then, Mayuri buried her face in my chest.[%p]
