Where am I?[%p]
Who am I?[%p]
I can’t see. I can barely think.[%p]
A terrible screech fills my head, like feedback from a giant speaker.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“AHHHHHHHHHHH!”[%p]
It penetrates my brain like a hundred sharp needles stabbing me right behind the eyes.[%p]
I thought brains weren’t supposed to feel pain.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]“...be!”[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aagh, ahhhh!!”[%p]
And there’s more.[%p]
I feel a shiver of pleasure beneath the pain, and a terrible itching like my body is on fire.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]“...kabe!”[%e]
I want to crack open my skull and tear out my brain.[%p]
I want to scrape out my soft gray matter with my fingers and eat it.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]“O...be!”[%e]
The assault on my brain is driving me crazy.[%p]
Who am I!?[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]“Okabe! What’s wrong with you!?”[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah!”[%p]
Suddenly, the shattered pieces of the world reform.[%p]
I slowly come back to my senses.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I’m in the lab, standing in front of the PhoneWave (name subject to change) with my cellphone to my ear.[%p]
No, not the PhoneWave (name subject to change). Since headgear is attached to it, it’s the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
It’s hard to breathe.[%p]
Give me oxygen.[%p]
I hear a low, wheezing groan and realize that it’s coming from my own throat.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ahhh...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I close my mouth, then take a deep breath.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...ckhaah, haahh, haahh, hah...”[%p]
The insides of my throat feel like they’re burning.[%p]
I resist the urge to cough and continue filling my lungs with air.[%p]
I notice that I’m drenched in sweat.[%p]
The drops sliding down my forehead are annoying.[%p]
I try to wipe them away with the back of my right hand.[%p]
My hand obeys... slowly.[%p]
Something is off.[%p]
It’s like my body and my mind aren’t totally in sync with each other.[%p]
Almost as if this isn’t really my body.[%p]
As if my nerves aren’t communicating properly with my extremities.[%p]
I try blinking slowly.[%p]
This might just be my imagination.[%p]
Could this be exhaustion?[%p]
I haven’t slept much lately.[%p]
I try to move my hand again.[%p]
There is no disconnect this time.[%p]
This is my body.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe? Are you listening?”[%p]
A familiar voice.[%p]
I turn around slowly.[%p]
Kurisu is there.[%p]
She stares at me, perplexed.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What was all that screaming for?”[%p]
What is she talking about?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you sick?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I try answering, but my voice doesn’t work too well.[%p]
Even more bewildered, I clear my throat several times.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...No, I’m fine.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then get ready to go already. We’re going shopping, remember?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Shopping?”[%p]
For what?[%p]
I search my memories.[%p]
The moment I do, images appear in my mind like a string of exploding lightbulbs.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Humans are temporal beings.’”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But now you’re fine.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you sure about this!? Really!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah... ah...”[%p]
I remember now.[%p]
I used the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’ll remember the future.”[%p]
That’s right! What am I standing around for!?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where am I?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Huh?”[%p]
I grab Kurisu’s shoulders and pull her close.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What time is it now!? What month? What day!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, that hurts! Calm down!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How can I be calm!? Shopping? You said we’re going shopping?”[%p]
Which shopping trip is she talking about?[%p]
Daru is sitting at his computer, staring at us wide-eyed.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru! What day is it!? What time is it!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uh, ummm, well, it’s the 13th... a little past 5.”[%p]
The 13th, a little past 5...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Did it work?”[%p]
Did I manage to time leap in the middle of all that chaos?[%p]
Did my memories really jump through time?[%p]
Does that mean I’ve leaped into my past self?[%p]
Is there a chance that it was all a dream?[%p]
Thinking back -- forward -- it doesn’t seem real.[%p]
Commandos breaking into the lab... it’s like something out of a Hollywood movie.[%p]
But the sight of Mayuri, broken and bloody, is burned into my eyes.[%p]
I remember the smell of the blood.[%p]
The sound of the gunshot.[%p]
The weight of the headgear on my head.[%p]
The pain of the bullet tearing through my arm.[%p]
Kurisu screaming. Suzuha fighting to defend us.[%p]
I remember it all vividly.[%p]
I touch my arm.[%p]
No bullet holes. No pain, even.[%p]
Was it all a dream?[%p]
I don’t know.[%p]
I’ve never time leaped before.[%p]
I can only hope that it was a dream.[%p]
A future like that... is too much to bear.[%p]
I recall Mayuri’s last moments and my eyes fill with tears.[%p]
I force the tide of emotion back.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Where’s Mayuri?”[%p]
I look around the lab.[%p]
Kurisu and Daru are here.[%p]
But I can’t find Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where’s Mayuri!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uh, she just left saying she was going to Luka-shi’s place. Weren’t you listening?”[%p]
That’s right. Mayuri went to beg Lukako to wear her costume. She won’t return until it’s time for the party.[%p]
What do I do?[%p]
What do I believe?[%p]
Was it a dream?[%p]
Or was it real?[%p]
If it was a dream, then I don’t have to worry about anything.[%p]
If it was real, then I need to act. Now.[%p]
I...[%p]
