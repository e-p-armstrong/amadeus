[name]Rintaro[line]“Whew...”[%p]
I take a deep breath.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It must have been a dream.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s no way something like that could really happen.”[%p]
It was a nightmare brought on by anxiety. That’s all.[%p]
There’s no other logical explanation.[%p]
I desperately persuade myself that it’s so.[%p]
Little do I know that I will soon regret my foolishness.[%p]
Kurisu goes shopping alone. I stay in the lab with Daru, waiting for Mayuri to return.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪ I’m back!”[%p]
An innocent smile.[%p]
Mayuri is alive.[%p]
Nothing will happen to her.[%p]
I was worried for nothing.[%p]
When Suzuha arrives, we begin the meeting.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin, Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I called Feris-chan and Luka-chan, but they said they couldn’t come.”[%p]
I’ve heard these words before.[%p]
[color index="820000"]Deja vu[color index="800000"]. A trick of the mind.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh. Do they have plans?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Feris-chan has a RaiNet tournament.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Crap, I should’ve gone to cheer! How careless of me!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And Luka-chan seemed embarrassed for some reason.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Maybe she thinks you’ll make her wear a costume again.”[%p]
It’s just like my dream.[%p]
I’ve never remembered a dream this vividly before. I remember every word that was spoken.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You still haven’t convinced her to cosplay?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“She said it was embarrassing. I keep telling her ’Cuteness is Justice’, but she never listens...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“’Cuteness is Justice’... is that what they say?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’re cute too, Chris-chan!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hah? Eh?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, ComiMa’s coming up. Wanna go?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I can’t make something new, but I have a costume of Post-Awakening Seira from Blood Tune I made last year. I think the size is just right for you too.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Me, cosplay?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m sorta interested.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But I refuse to do it in public, though.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You don’t have to show anyone, but eventually, you’ll want them to see. The cosplay demon compels you!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That reminds me. Chris-chan, you’re always wearing that cute uniform. What school is it from?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh, this?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I attended Ayamein for about two weeks. I modeled this outfit after their uniform.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh! Their uniform is really cute, but you made it even cuter! You might have really good design sense♪”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’ll bring the costume tomorrow, okay? Will you try it on then?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sure.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“When’s the photo shoot?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Good to know you’re still a pervert, Hashida.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Come on, it’s Blood Tune’s Seira! She’s got ’panmoro’ going on!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Panmoro?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It means her panties are completely exposed!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“N-no way...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s okay♪”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You might not know this, but last year, there was a really popular saying.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“’They’re not panties, so it’s not embarrassing!’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Japan is over...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wear it, okay? It’s a promise!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Maybe you shouldn’t bother.”[%p]
Suzuha speaks, her tone sharp.[%p]
She’s scowling at Kurisu again.[%p]
Suddenly, the atmosphere in the room changes.[%p]
...I remember this too.[%p]
I feel like I’m losing my mind here.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’re asking for trouble by trusting Makise Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What’s that supposed to mean?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ve been meaning to ask. Did I do something to you?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Not to me. But I know everything you have done.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What do you mean? I’ve done nothing to be guilty of.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Perhaps. But I know your true nature.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wow, you can see into my heart? That’s groundbreaking technology. I’d love to hear how it works.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s not science. It’s... a prediction.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So you’re just making it up.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I [color index="A0140000"]know[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin.”[%p]
Mayuri clings to me with teary eyes.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Stop them from fighting.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Should I listen to Mayuri’s plea? Like I did in the dream?[%p]
Knowing that I can’t stop the fight, should I just let Mayuri handle it instead?[%p]
I don’t know. I can’t move a muscle.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Geez...”[%p]
Mayuri pouts, then goes over to the two girls.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, guys? Mayushii doesn’t like it when you fight. Let’s all get along, okay?”[%p]
Daru comes over to chat with Suzuha, and gradually peace returns to the lab.[%p]
Kurisu is in the development room, making a call. Probably to her mother in America.[%p]
I sit on the sofa and watch TV while sipping Dr P.[%p]
But I can’t pay attention to what I see on the screen.[%p]
It doesn’t enter my head.[%p]
Mayuri sits down next to me.[%p]
She peels a banana and begins eating it.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s been really lively here these past few weeks, huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Stop it.[%p]
Why are you saying the same things as in that terrible dream?[%p]
It was a dream. It has to be a dream.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s fun♪”[%p]
Mayuri smiles happily, not noticing my lack of a reply.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, now that there are eight lab mems, Mayushii thinks it’s getting a little cramped in here.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“First, we don’t have enough chairs.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“We should buy more. Do you have money, Okarin?”[%p]
I shake my head wordlessly.[%p]
For some reason, I’m afraid to look Mayuri in the face.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I guess you can use some of my salary.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“We need a new microwave too. Otherwise, I can’t warm up any Juicy Chicken Number One.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin... are you okay? You don’t look so good.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s nothing...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Are you feeling sick? Then you need to rest. Want to lie down? You can lie on my lap, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not--”[%p]
Before I can finish, the television interrupts me with an urgent news bulletin.[%p]
The subtitles read “Terrorist bomb threat suspends Yamanote, Sobu, Keihin-Tohoku lines.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“A bomb threat?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hang on. Those lines all pass through Akiba. How is Mayu-shi gonna get home?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh yeah. I should call home.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No... it can’t be...”[%p]
It’s the same.[%p]
Every last thing, the same.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okabe Rintaro. I need to know.”[%p]
It was a dream.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’ve completed the Time Leap Machine, right?”[%p]
It had to be a dream.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
But if it was a dream, then why...[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Are you listening?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uh, the Time Leap Machine’s done.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okay.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I just remembered I’ve got something to do. I’m going out.”[%p]
Suzuha leaves the lab without another word.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What’s wrong with her?”[%p]
Does she know what’s about to happen?[%p]
Nothing’s going to happen. The break-in was a dream.[%p]
But no matter how hard I try to convince myself of that, I can’t shake the icy hand clutching my heart.[%p]
I can’t breathe.[%p]
Even though it’s hot and humid, my body shivers.[%p]
I remember this feeling, too, from the dream.[%p]
Did I choose wrong?[%p]
Was I granted a second chance, only to let it go to waste?[%p]
A soft feeling against my fingers.[%p]
I look down to see Mayuri’s hand holding mine. When I look up, I see worry written in her face.[%p]
I reflexively look towards the door.[%p]
If the dream wasn’t a dream, then...[%p]
Any second now...[%p]
