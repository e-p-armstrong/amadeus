It happens exactly as I remember.[%p]
Five men burst into the lab.[%p]
Their movements are swift and sure -- professional -- and each of them is carrying a gun.[%p]
They spread out just inside the door and aim their weapons at us.[%p]
I recognize each of them.[%p]
There’s no denying it now.[%p]
I did leap through time. It was the future I remembered.[%p]
I was supposed to change this present, to stop the madness about to unfold.[%p]
But I told myself that it was a dream, and wasted my chance to save everyone.[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“Hands in the air. Nobody move.”[%p]
Silence.[%p]
Time seems to grind to a halt.[%p]
The men say nothing.[%p]
Why didn’t I do anything to change this?[%p]
Wasn’t that why I leapt through time!?[%p]
The sound of heels echoes down the hallway.[%p]
A woman is coming up the stairs.[%p]
Kiryu Moeka.[%p]
The woman who killed -- who will kill Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
The dream was real. Those were memories of the future.[%p]
This is happening because I did nothing to stop it.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“M-Moeka-san?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“We’re taking the time machine.”[%p]
If I kill her first, will Mayuri live?[%p]
I consider the option, but soon give up.[%p]
The real danger is the men behind her.[%p]
Three of them have assault rifles.[%p]
They’ll gun us down the instant I try anything.[%p]
My only hope is for Suzuha to make her move before Mayuri is shot.[%p]
Is there even a chance?[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Makise Kurisu, Okabe Rintaro, Hashida Itaru. The three of you will come with us.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You can’t resist.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Come with us.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“W-where?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
I have no words.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“At least tell us where we’re going.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You cannot refuse.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“There is nowhere to run.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“We have men stationed throughout Akihabara.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I don’t want to hurt anyone.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“The three of you come with us.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why just the three of us?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’m not answering your questions.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Come with us. It’s your only choice.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“M-Moeka-san, you’re a lab mem too... aren’t you?”[%p]
In reply...[%p]
Moeka pulls a gun from her belt and points it at us.[%p]
It’s happening again.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Our mission...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Is to silence you.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Your refusal to come will change nothing.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Come with us. Now.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“If you continue to resist, I’ll have to resort to extreme measures.”[%p]
Moeka slowly raises her gun.[%p]
She points the muzzle at...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Shiina Mayuri is not needed.”[%p]
I try to shout “Stop!” but my voice catches in my throat.[%p]
Nothing comes out but a pitiful wheeze.[%p]
I turn to Kurisu for help.[%p]
Kurisu is staring at Mayuri. She looks as if she might start crying at any second.[%p]
I turn to Daru.[%p]
He’s shaking. His lips move as if to speak, but nothing comes out.[%p]
Someone.[%p]
Anyone.[%p]
Please.[%p]
Stop her.[%p]
Stop Moeka![%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“For SERN... for FB... for SERN... for FB...”[%p]
Her lips close tightly.[%p]
A sharp, dry crack splits the air.[%p]
Time slows to a crawl.[%p]
Moeka pulled the trigger.[%p]
Blood spurts from Mayuri’s forehead.[%p]
It splashes across my face, wet and warm.[%p]
Her delicate, frail body falls towards me.[%p]
I catch her.[%p]
Her body is limp, like a puppet with no strings.[%p]
Her head and arms dangle lifelessly.[%p]
The smell of gunpowder fills my nose.[%p]
And then, the smell of blood.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wahhhhhhhhhhh!”[%p]
Daru clutches his head and falls to his knees, screaming at the top of his lungs.[%p]
In my arms, Mayuri takes one long, ragged breath.[%p]
And then...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“O...kari...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No... no!”[%p]
She’s dead.[%p]
Mayuri’s dead. Again.[%p]
Her face is covered in blood.[%p]
Her blood stains my hands.[%p]
It’s warm.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You three come with us. Now.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“No more warnings.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Resist, and we will kill you too.”[%p]
I hear a voice.[%p]
But I can’t comprehend what it’s saying.[%p]
It’s the same.[%p]
I knew it would be.[%p]
I let Mayuri die again.[%p]
Because I didn’t believe my own memories of the future.[%p]
I lay Mayuri down on the floor.[%p]
I’m sorry, Mayuri.[%p]
I’m so sorry...[%p]
I stand up.[%p]
Rage takes hold of me once again. I’m helpless to resist.[%p]
I take one menacing step towards Moeka.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe!”[%p]
Kurisu grabs my hand before I can take another.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You can’t!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let me go!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You can’t! They’ll kill you!”[%p]
Moeka’s gun is aimed at my head.[%p]
Her finger is already on the trigger.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You gonna kill me too!?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“If you resist.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Please, Okabe, do what she says. Okay?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Otherwise, they’ll kill you too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gh...!”[%p]
I grit my teeth and suppress my anger.[%p]
Just then, something small and round strikes Moeka’s gun hand.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...!?”[%p]
She drops her gun.[%p]
At her feet lies a small stone.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Get down!”[%p]
[name]Attacker B[line]“Gweh!!”[%p]
The next events transpire exactly as I remember. Suzuha appears in the doorway, knocking down the first man before anyone can react.[%p]
She then proceeds to dispatch the remaining men with a series of swift, precise maneuvers.[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“Who the hell!?”[%p]
The dark-skinned man, the last one standing, takes aim at Suzuha with his assault rifle.[%p]
But before he can fire, Suzuha snatches a stunned attacker’s gun and shoots him.[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“Gwah!!”[%p]
Blood spurts from the man’s hand.[%p]
Without stopping, Suzuha delivers a soaring roundhouse kick to the man’s jaw.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Enough.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“!!”[%p]
Moeka and Suzuha point their guns at each other.[%p]
A standoff. Neither moves.[%p]
Silence returns to the room.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Who are you?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“42.”[%p]
She glances at me.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“TV.”[%p]
This time, I already know what she means.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Turned on.”[%p]
I make a break for the development room.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Don’t move!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s my line!”[%p]
Kurisu is right behind me.[%p]
I grab the headgear and jam it on my head without a moment’s hesitation.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe, I--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m going back!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But what if it fails!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Get the machine started!”[%p]
There’s no time to argue. I grab Moad Snake from the shelf.[%p]
Kurisu bites her lip and starts setting up the X68000.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okabe Rintaro! One of them’s headed your way!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Kill them! Don’t let them use it!”[%p]
Before the crew-cut man enters the development room, I push the switch.[%p]
White smoke instantly fills the room, rendering it impossible to see.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you sure, Okabe!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you sure about this!? Really!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do it, Kurisu! Activate the machine!”[%p]
I see blue-white light shining through the smoke.[%p]
The discharge is starting![%p]
The light rapidly grows brighter.[%p]
The floor begins to shake.[%p]
The singularity is open![%p]
I crouch down, holding the headset steady with one hand.[%p]
This is reality.[%p]
It wasn’t a dream.[%p]
I burn that fact into my mind as I prepare to time leap.[%p]
One more chance...[%p]
The shaking begins.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please! Give me one more chance!”[%p]
Once more, the world explodes into light.[%p]
I can’t hear. It feels like something is crushing my eardrums.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah!”[%p]
Slowly, the shattered pieces of the world reform.[%p]
My body convulses as if struck by lightning.[%p]
I... am Okabe Rintaro.[%p]
I’m in the lab development room, standing in front of the Time Leap Machine with my phone to my ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Gh.”[%p]
My brain hurts again.[%p]
This isn’t like a headache. It’s somehow deeper.[%p]
With the pain comes a torrent of emotions -- sorrow, longing, hope, joy -- that threatens to wash away my psyche.[%p]
However, only one thing matters.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...It worked again.”[%p]
I quickly return to the lounge.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Kya! You surprised me!”[%p]
I almost crashed into Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t startle me like that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]”Daru! Is it just before 5 on the 13th!?” [%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Eh? Um... yeah?”[%p]
Alright. Time leap successful.[%p]
I pat Kurisu on the shoulders, almost in an embrace.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re a genius.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“W-what’s gotten in to you? Stop manhandling me. It’s gross.”[%p]
I scramble for my phone.[%p]
