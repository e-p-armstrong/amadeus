[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Tutturu♪ Mayushii here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri! Where are--”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“But I can’t answer the phone right now.”[%p]
...It went to voice mail?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Please leave your message after the beep♪”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri! Contact me at once! Okay? At once!”[%p]
I hang up.[%p]
I look at my watch again. It’s just past 5.[%p]
Thank god for the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
It makes me shiver to imagine what would have happened without it.[%p]
I have three hours until Moeka kills Mayuri.[%p]
Everything’s going to be okay.[%p]
That’s plenty of time to escape.[%p]
First, I’ll meet up with Mayuri and leave Akiba.[%p]
We can go to Ikebukuro.[%p]
Wait, what if they’re watching her house?[%p]
Maybe we should hop the bullet train and get out of Tokyo entirely.[%p]
Anyway, we’re fine as long as Moeka doesn’t find her today.[%p]
So first, I need to find Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe? You look kind of crazy. What’s wrong?”[%p]
Kurisu and Daru look at me with concern.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Both of you get out of here. Now.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...What’s this about?”[%p]
I check my wallet.[%p]
I only have 9000 yen and some change.[%p]
I’ll need to stop by an ATM and withdraw everything I have.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Is this another one of your fantasies?”[%p]
Kurisu shrugs her shoulders dumbfounded. I don’t have time to answer her.[%p]
I slip beside her and dash out of the lab.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe! Where are you going? Hey!”[%p]
