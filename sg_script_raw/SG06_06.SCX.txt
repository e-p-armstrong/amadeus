I run full speed to Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
Naturally, I have to stop for breath before I get more than a few blocks.[%p]
The sun is setting, but the temperature still hasn’t dropped below 30.[%p]
Sweat quickly covers my entire body.[%p]
I’m not good at exercise in the first place.[%p]
I finally stagger through the archway.[%p]
Now I regret not borrowing Suzuha’s bicycle.[%p]
But no, there wasn’t time for that. Finding Mayuri comes first.[%p]
I run to the courtyard, where I find Lukako standing alone with her bamboo broom.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...Ah, Okabe-san!”[%p]
She bows her head.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri! Where’s Mayuri!?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um, Mayuri-chan already left.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She left!?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yes...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... when you see her, could you tell her that I’m sorry?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’d really prefer not to cosplay...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I don’t want to disappoint her, but it’s too embarrassing to dress like that in front of people...”[%p]
I finally catch my breath.[%p]
I don’t have time to listen to Lukako’s apologies.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri went back to the lab?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh? Um... I think so.”[%p]
That doesn’t make sense.[%p]
I know she comes to the lab around 6:30.[%p]
It’s still 5:30.[%p]
No matter how slowly you walk, it shouldn’t take more than 20 minutes to get to the lab.[%p]
So what was she doing for the extra forty minutes?[%p]
We don’t have time for this![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She didn’t say she was dropping by somewhere?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“No... I didn’t ask...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... is something wrong?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If Mayuri comes back here, tell her to call me right away!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“O-okay!”[%p]
I’d better check the lab. We might have missed each other.[%p]
When I get back to the lab, nobody’s there but Daru.[%p]
Did Kurisu go shopping by herself?[%p]
I call out to him as he’s ordering pizza on the computer.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where’s Mayuri!? Did she come back!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? No.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kuh! Where is she!?”[%p]
I take a bottle of Dr P out of the fridge and chug it down.[%p]
The cold, sparkling liquid wets my parched throat and drives the heat away.[%p]
Now I can think.[%p]
But I still can’t relax.[%p]
Every minute -- every second -- is precious.[%p]
Each moment I waste brings me closer to Mayuri’s death.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hey, Okarin. Why are you so jumpy?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I need to find Mayuri!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Isn’t she at Luka-shi’s?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Not anymore. She was gone by the time I got there.”[%p]
I start to pace in irritation.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Maybe she went to see one of her cosplay friends?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who? What’s her phone number?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“How should I know?”[%p]
Damn.[%p]
It’s easy to forget, since she’s usually here, but Mayuri and I rarely spend time together outside of the lab.[%p]
MayQueen and the shrine. That’s about it. I have no idea where else she might go.[%p]
MayQueen doesn’t even exist on this worldline.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Ah, now that you mention it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you know something!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I think she said that her phone was about to run out of power. She had to turn it off.”[%p]
Yet another setback.[%p]
Not only am I unable to contact her, she might not even notice my phone calls.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hey, what’s going on?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Why are you still here, Daru? I thought I told you to leave!”[%p]
I sit on the sofa.[%p]
I feel the weight of stress on my shoulders and in my bones.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m not leaving without a good reason.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Tell me what’s going on, man.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...They’re going to kill Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“SERN’s after us. In two hours, their men will break in and kill Mayuri. Get out while you still can!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What? For real?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you get in touch with Kurisu? Pass the message onto her.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“In two hours? How do you know that?”[%p]
Daru pauses for a moment. He looks towards the development room, where the Time Leap Machine is sitting.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“No way. You used it?”[%p]
I nod gravely.[%p]
I kick Daru out of the lab and send him home.[%p]
He promised to call Kurisu for me and tell her to stay at her hotel, but a few minutes later, she calls me directly and demands an explanation. It takes some effort, but I manage to convince her to do as I say.[%p]
Now I just need to wait for Mayuri to get back.[%p]
I thought about looking for her, but it’s too risky. We could miss each other like we did at the shrine. Better to wait here in front of the building.[%p]
While waiting, I try to convince myself that everything will be okay.[%p]
Mayuri returns to the lab at 6:30.[%p]
That leaves about an hour before Moeka’s attack.[%p]
In an hour, we could ride the bullet train from Tokyo Station to Shizuoka.[%p]
Is that the best plan?[%p]
Maybe we should get off at Yokohama and lay low in a hotel for a while.[%p]
I can think about what comes next after Mayuri’s safe.[%p]
The Time Leap Machine doesn’t matter. Moeka can have it.[%p]
My top priority is to prevent Mayuri’s death.[%p]
Sweat accumulates on my forehead and rolls down my face.[%p]
Hurry back, Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Startled, I turn towards the voice.[%p]
Suzuha and Mister Braun have emerged from the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
I see them lock the door. Guess they’re closing up shop.[%p]
That’s right, I forgot about Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What are you doing here, Okabe Rintaro?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nothing...”[%p]
That reminds me.[%p]
During the attack, she took down five armed commandos in the blink of an eye.[%p]
I still can’t believe it. Where does an 18-year-old girl learn to move like that?[%p]
And then there was her strange behavior immediately before the attack. She left as soon as she heard about the bomb threat, almost as if she knew something was going to happen.[%p]
And finally, there’s that business with her father. Everything about her is a mystery.[%p]
Who is Amane Suzuha?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, I know! You’re getting ready for that party tonight, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How did you know we’re having a party?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Shiina Mayuri. She came by earlier today to invite me over.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hope you’ve got room for one more, ’cuz I’m--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can’t!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Um... am I a bother?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...No.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s okay. I understand. I guess I’m still an outsider.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s not it!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“What’s wrong with you, Okabe?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Let my part-timer join your little club. You owe her, remember? It’s thanks to her belly that I let ya’ off the hook for shaking the building last time.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“My belly? Hey!”[%p]
Suzuha has recovered her jacket. She’s properly dressed now.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“She’s got a fine belly. Tight and well trained.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m standing right here, you dirty old man.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The party is canceled. I’m sorry, Part-Time Warrior, but please go home today.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Canceled?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. Sorry.”[%p]
I attempt a smile, but with little hope of success.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“I don’t know what’s going on, Okabe, but don’t do anything reckless.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Huh?”[%p]
It’s weird to have him give me advice.[%p]
I thought he was just a dirty old man who loved CRTs.[%p]
Maybe he’s sharper than I thought.[%p]
Or maybe he’s just telling me to stop shaking the building.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I... got in a fight with Mayuri. Things are a little complicated right now. That’s all.”[%p]
That’s the best lie I can manage.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, is there gonna be blood?”[%p]
Blood?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I mean, look over there.”[%p]
Suzuha points across the street.[%p]
I turn to look. To my surprise, there’s Mayuri walking up the street with a big bag.[%p]
When she notices us, she waves her hand with a ditzy smile.[%p]
Mayuri![%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh? Weren’t you fighting? She looks really happy to see you.”[%p]
I ignore Suzuha and run to Mayuri.[%p]
The clock on my phone says 6:33.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hey! Where are you going!?”[%p]
I wasted precious time talking to Suzuha.[%p]
Now that I’ve secured Mayuri, we need to get as far away from Akiba as we can![%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What’s the rush, Okarin?”[%p]
I ignore her question and grab her hand.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Run! To the station!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wawawa...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“W-w-wait! My bag...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Forget it! Just run!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Eh? Why?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just run!”[%p]
I can’t get the image of Mayuri’s death out of my mind.[%p]
I won’t let them kill her. I won’t.[%p]
Mayuri gives no further resistance.[%p]
She follows obediently, quickly matching my pace.[%p]
I forgot that she’s faster on her feet than I am.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, where are we going?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Haah, haah, haah, first we’ll head for, haah, Tsukuba or Yokohama...”[%p]
I’m already gasping for air. Mayuri, however, might as well be strolling along for all the difficulty she’s having.[%p]
How can she be so ditzy yet so athletic at the same time!?[%p]
