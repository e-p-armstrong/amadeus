The sun has already set, but the sky is still a mix of indigo and orange.[%p]
We run through streets lit by dazzling shops.[%p]
Everything will be fine once we make it on the train.[%p]
I hold this thought in my mind as we run.[%p]
I’m already exhausted. Mayuri practically has to drag me along to keep going.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Shouldn’t we rest a bit?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No... stopping... until... we’re on... the train...”[%p]
I do my best to keep up the pace.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But Okarin, you’re covered in sweat. You shouldn’t push yourself. You’re not good at exercise.”[%p]
When we reach the station, I realize that something is wrong.[%p]
The station is packed. Seriously packed. You don’t see this many people even at rush hour.[%p]
The crowd is milling around the entrance. For some reason, it looks like no one is going in.[%p]
What’s going on here? A protest? Some kind of street performance?[%p]
I don’t have time for this![%p]
Just then, an announcement plays over the PA.[%p]
[name]Premise Announcer[line]“Your attention please. The Yamanote, Keihin-Tohoku, and Sobu Lines are currently suspended.”[%p]
[name]Premise Announcer[line]“We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, and kindly ask for your cooperation.”[%p]
Finally, I realize my mistake.[%p]
That’s right. Before the attack, the trains were stopped by a bomb threat![%p]
No wonder there are so many people standing around.[%p]
In my haste to flee the city, I completely forgot! How could I have been so stupid!?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I wonder what happened...”[%p]
All of the train lines are stopped. We can’t escape Akiba![%p]
What about other means of public transportation -- the subway or the bus?[%p]
Should we go to another station?[%p]
I turn around and head back the way we came, keeping a firm grip on Mayuri’s hand.[%p]
But before we get more than a few steps, a man steps out of the crowd and blocks our way.[%p]
I realize that we’re surrounded.[%p]
[name]???[line]“Okabe Rintaro?”[%p]
A low voice.[%p]
A face I’ve never seen.[%p]
He’s not one of the five who broke into the lab.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin, do you know these people?”[%p]
Mayuri grips my arm tightly as she looks anxiously at the men.[%p]
[name]???[line]“Come with us.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who are you?”[%p]
Instead of answering, the man makes a grab for my arm.[%p]
I jerk away and try to escape, but the men move to block us again.[%p]
[name]???[line]“If you resist, we’ll kill you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“SERN!”[%p]
They’re with Moeka!?[%p]
She must have planned for this in advance.[%p]
A chill runs up my spine.[%p]
We made a terrible mistake when we hacked into SERN. I realize that now, though it’s far too late.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you going to kill us with all these witnesses around?”[%p]
[name]???[line]“This isn’t a game.”[%p]
I feel something cold against my back.[%p]
I don’t realize what it is at first.[%p]
Then it hits me.[%p]
A gun.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I gulp.[%p]
My blood goes cold.[%p]
Am I going to die here?[%p]
Will my time leaping be for naught?[%p]
No! I can’t give up.[%p]
I won’t let Mayuri die.[%p]
I won’t accept that future.[%p]
But how do I get out of this?[%p]
The crowd at the station has grown even thicker. People are starting to argue with the station personnel, demanding to know when they can go home.[%p]
The situation is quickly becoming chaotic.[%p]
Suddenly, a fight breaks out nearby. It looks like some people are trying to shove their way through.[%p]
This could be our chance.[%p]
A tide of people surges into us, knocking the man behind me off balance.[%p]
Now![%p]
I quickly turn and strike the man’s hand aside.[%p]
His gun falls away.[%p]
Then the man gets swallowed by the crowd.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Run, Mayuri!”[%p]
I grab Mayuri’s hand and start running.[%p]
We have to fight our way through the crowd, but that also thwarts our pursuers.[%p]
As soon as we reach the main street, we start running back towards the lab.[%p]
Of course, we can’t return to the lab itself. Moeka’s group will be there shortly.[%p]
Is the subway still running? If we get on at Suehirocho Station, we can take the Ginza line to Shibuya. From there, we can grab a train heading out of Tokyo.[%p]
I still haven’t recovered from my exhaustion. I don’t know how much longer I can hold on.[%p]
We can’t stop now. I have to keep running.[%p]
It doesn’t take long before a new obstacle appears.[%p]
Four men walking together up ahead suddenly stop and turn to face us.[%p]
I’ve got a bad feeling about this.[%p]
They don’t look like otaku. Are they with SERN too?[%p]
My fears are confirmed when the four men start walking towards us, arms spread to block the street.[%p]
No doubt about it. They’re after us too![%p]
I turn to flee back towards the station, and there I see the first group of men closing in behind us.[%p]
We’re trapped. Enemies on both sides.[%p]
There’s only one choice. I grab Mayuri and make for the nearby side street.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Where are we going, Okarin!?”[%p]
I’m trying to get to Suehirocho Station without using the main streets.[%p]
But as we pass UPX, several men on the bridge point at us and shout something.[%p]
Are they with SERN too!?[%p]
How many men do they have!?[%p]
We turn back and change course.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Haah, haah, okay, Mayuri, you’re, a faster, haah, haah, runner, so...”[%p]
Talking while running uses up all of my breath.[%p]
Sweat drips into my eyes, making it hard to see.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You, go on, ahead! Go, to Hariti shrine, in Ikebukuro. We’ll meet--”[%p]
Before I finish, I catch sight of another group of men waiting for us up ahead.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What’s going on, Okarin!?”[%p]
I look back.[%p]
The group from before is chasing us.[%p]
We’re surrounded by enemies.[%p]
The familiar streets of Akiba are filled with agents of SERN.[%p]
I recall what Moeka said.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You have nowhere to run.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“We have men stationed throughout Akihabara.”[%p]
Despair seizes my heart.[%p]
Is escape impossible?[%p]
We’re just kids playing at science in the safety of our tiny little lab.[%p]
Our enemy is a multinational conspiracy willing to kill anyone who gets in their way.[%p]
Were we doomed from the start?[%p]
No! No matter what, we must get away![%p]
Leading Mayuri by the hand, I push my way through the crowd, then jump the fence onto the road.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!?”[%p]
Something strikes me with crushing force, sending me tumbling across the pavement.[%p]
I come to a stop several meters away. My body is wracked with intense pain.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gah...hah...”[%p]
A red curtain covers my eyes.[%p]
I try to brush it off, and my hand comes away slick with blood.[%p]
I grit my teeth against the pain and lift my head.[%p]
Mayuri is lying on the pavement a few meters away.[%p]
I reach out to her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ma... yuri...”[%p]
No response.[%p]
Mayuri is motionless.[%p]
No...[%p]
Did the impact... kill her?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri...”[%p]
This can’t be happening.[%p]
The car that ran us over -- a white van -- pulls up.[%p]
The door opens, and out steps...[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...I’ve stopped them.”[%p]
Kiryu Moeka.[%p]
Her again.[%p]
She knew the exact moment to be here in order to run over poor Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’ve secured Okabe-kun... I mean, Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
She’s talking to someone on her phone. Has she been tracking us this whole time?[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Contact the police. Shiina Mayuri is dead.”[%p]
She looks down at me with eyes cold enough to freeze my blood.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why... why did you kill her!?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Because you ran.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You monster!”[%p]
Mustering my strength, I leap up and throw myself at Moeka.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“!?”[%p]
She goes down hard. I hear her head smack against the pavement.[%p]
I stand up and look around. Moeka is dazed and unable to stand, but I see SERN agents making their way towards us through the crowd.[%p]
I’ve got to get out of here.[%p]
I take a step. A sharp pain stabs through my body.[%p]
The crash must have broken a bone in my leg.[%p]
It doesn’t matter. I have to get to the lab and time leap again.[%p]
That’s the only way to save Mayuri.[%p]
I look back at the site of the accident.[%p]
Moeka is slowly regaining her feet, but Mayuri remains limp and motionless on the road.[%p]
It breaks my heart to leave Mayuri lying there, but I have no choice.[%p]
I have to go.[%p]
Back to the lab![%p]
Fighting the pain of my broken leg, I manage to drag myself back to the lab.[%p]
Surprisingly, SERN’s men didn’t chase me.[%p]
Nobody’s at the lab when I arrive.[%p]
Only the lights are still on.[%p]
Relieved that Kurisu and Daru haven’t returned, I head straight to the development room.[%p]
I remembered to break into the Braun Tube Workshop to turn on the 42-inch CRT.[%p]
My body is drenched in sweat, and I can’t stop shivering. Everything hurts, especially my right side, where the car hit me.[%p]
If I’m not careful, I might lose consciousness.[%p]
My vision is blurry. It’s hard to focus.[%p]
My left arm is numb and can barely move.[%p]
But still, I force myself to activate the X68000 and input the settings.[%p]
I’m gasping for breath like a wounded animal. The sound of my heartbeat fills my ears.[%p]
Mayuri...[%p]
They killed her again.[%p]
I failed to protect her.[%p]
I’m sorry, Mayuri. I’m sorry...[%p]
Choking back my tears, I frantically pound on the keyboard.[%p]
Police sirens echo in the distance.[%p]
Moeka hit Mayuri in front of hundreds of witnesses. They’ll probably take her in for questioning.[%p]
Even if SERN bails her out somehow, she should be stuck for at least a couple of hours.[%p]
The real problem is her men.[%p]
Those mercenaries, or whatever they were. SERN’s hit squad.[%p]
Why didn’t they come after me?[%p]
It should have been easy for them to catch me, injured as I am.[%p]
I need to hurry.[%p]
If they show up here, they’ll kill me for sure.[%p]
Settings complete.[%p]
I put on the headgear. I’ll get blood on it, but that doesn’t matter.[%p]
A surge of anxiety washes over me.[%p]
What if the time leap fails?[%p]
What if my memories are corrupted?[%p]
I might forget who I am. I might lose myself.[%p]
Should I really use the machine?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course I should.”[%p]
I curse my weakness.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri’s dead, remember?”[%p]
This can’t be allowed to happen.[%p]
No risk is too great. I will save Mayuri, whatever it takes.[%p]
I alone have the power to change the past.[%p]
What am I waiting for!?[%p]
Swallowing my fear, I activate the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
