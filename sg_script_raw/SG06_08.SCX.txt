[name]Rintaro[line]“Gah!”[%p]
A screeching in my ears. Needles stabbing into my brain. A thousand emotions flooding my senses.[%p]
The world bends, pulses, then returns to normal.[%p]
The pain of my wounds has vanished like magic, replaced by a piercing pain in my brain.[%p]
I fight back a wave of nausea and take stock of the situation.[%p]
I’m sitting on the sofa with my phone to my ear.[%p]
Another successful time leap. That makes three.[%p]
It looks like the Time Leap Machine works perfectly. I’m sure it would boost Kurisu’s confidence if I told her.[%p]
But that will have to wait until Mayuri’s out of danger.[%p]
I stand up and look around the lab.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where’s Mayuri!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wha!?”[%p]
Kurisu, who was dozing off next to me, wakes up with a jerk at the sound of my voice.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t shout...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ve been working all night, so let me rest a bit...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where is Mayuri!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What’s wrong with you? She went to Luka-shi’s, remember?”[%p]
Damn, she already left?[%p]
I should call or send a mail.[%p]
I need to get in touch with her somehow![%p]
Mayuri went to see someone after leaving the shrine. The question is who.[%p]
Think.[%p]
Consider every possibility![%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Tutturu♪ Mayushii here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri! Where are--”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“But I can’t answer the phone right now.”[%p]
...I got her voice mail?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Please leave your message after the beep♪”[%p]
...It’s the same as last time.[%p]
Damn! Why did I forget?[%p]
Before I time leaped, I should have asked Mayuri where she was today.[%p]
I’m not thinking straight. I have to calm down.[%p]
Wait... I know.[%p]
Last time, we failed because we went to Akihabara Station.[%p]
I should have known that SERN would be watching.[%p]
This time, we’ll take a taxi to another station, then hide somewhere until things calm down.[%p]
For now, all I can do is wait for Mayuri to return. It’s driving me crazy.[%p]
I consider explaining the situation to Kurisu and Daru, but I just don’t have the strength to do that right now.[%p]
Besides, I don’t want to get them involved.[%p]
I’ll take care of it myself. I won’t let any more of my friends die.[%p]
[name]Luka[line][color index="8A0000"]“Hello. This is Urushibara.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako! It’s me! Okabe!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okabe-san? What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is Mayuri there? If she is, let me speak to her!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okay. Just a moment please.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Tutturu♪ Mayushii here. What’s up, Okarin?”[%p]
Finally... I’ve managed to get ahold of Mayuri.[%p]
This will give us hours to spare.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where are you now? Yanabayashi Shrine!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Yup!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m headed there now. Whatever you do, don’t move, okay!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Huh? Why not?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What’s all the commotion?”[%p]
Kurisu’s eyes are half asleep.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru. Assistant. Leave right now and get as far from Akiba as you can. But under no circumstances use the train.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What? Why?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you can, go somewhere you don’t normally go, and stay there overnight. Understand?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, overnight? So you’re saying we should go to a love hotel and make hanky panky. I understand.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Shut it, perv.”[%p]
Kurisu gets up.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What’s going on, Okabe?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please, just do as I say. We’ll talk later. Don’t come back to the lab until I say so!”[%p]
I thought of having them take the Time Leap Machine, but the microwave’s pretty heavy to carry around. And it’s that time machine that Moeka’s really after. Not Mayuri.[%p]
If it will guarantee everyone’s safety, I’d rather just abandon the time machine.[%p]
I dash out of the lab, disregarding Kurisu’s and Daru’s demands for an explanation.[%p]
I was right to borrow Suzuha’s bicycle.[%p]
I arrive at the shrine far earlier than if I had run.[%p]
Mayuri and Lukako are in front of the main building.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin♪”[%p]
Mayuri waves her hand happily. Lukako bows her head.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Are you here to back me up?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Back you up?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“To help convince Luka-chan to wear my costume!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Mayuri-chan, I really can’t. It’s too embarrassing...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, Okarin. Can you think of some way to persuade Luka-chan?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii can’t reach the ending for the Luka-chan route.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I keep telling her I can’t... but Mayuri-chan just won’t give up.”[%p]
Tears well up in my eyes.[%p]
I grit my teeth and resist the urge to cry.[%p]
To see them talking, so happy and carefree...[%p]
I thought that this peace would last forever.[%p]
And yet...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry, you two. Save the cosplay talk for later.”[%p]
I grab Mayuri’s hand.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Drop your bags, Mayuri. Leave them with Lukako.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh? What’s going on?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’re leaving town.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Leaving town? We’re going on a trip?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“A... trip?”[%p]
Lukako’s face turns red.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Just the two of you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s right.”[%p]
I’ll let Lukako misunderstand whatever she wants.[%p]
I take off running, half dragging Mayuri along.[%p]
We get out to Manseibashi Bridge. Now I need to figure out where we go from here.[%p]
It’s half past 4. We should still have about three hours before the trains stop.[%p]
If we wanted to, we could even leave from Akiba station.[%p]
But that seems like a bad idea. Moeka and her men might already be there.[%p]
We should board from another station.[%p]
If the plan is to head for Yokohama, the fastest way is to take the bullet train from Tokyo Station.[%p]
To get to Tokyo Station without passing through Akihabara Station means boarding at Kanda or Awajicho.[%p]
We could walk to Tokyo Station in an hour, but I don’t want to waste that much time.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Where are we going, Okarin? What’s the rush?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“SERN’s after us.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh? What does that mean?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll explain later. First we need to get out of Akiba.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“O-okay...”[%p]
I decide on Awajicho Station and start running.[%p]
If we can make it to Yasukuni-dori, the station’s right there.[%p]
But I freeze when I see a group of six men walking just ahead.[%p]
Are they Moeka’s men?[%p]
I don’t know, but we can’t take the chance. I pull Mayuri into a nearby alley.[%p]
How many men does SERN have?[%p]
When did these patrols start?[%p]
Are they watching stations besides Akihabara?[%p]
I have no way of knowing.[%p]
To make matters worse, SERN’s assassins are indistinguishable from ordinary shoppers at a glance. You can tell they’re different when you get close, but by then it’s too late.[%p]
They could be anyone. Japanese, foreigners, anyone.[%p]
Damn! What should we do?[%p]
Should we take the shortest route and risk being seen?[%p]
Or should we stick to the back streets and stay out of sight?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin... Mayushii’s kinda scared...”[%p]
The fear on Mayuri’s face gives me my answer.[%p]
I can’t expose her to danger.[%p]
We have to take the back roads.[%p]
It doesn’t have to be Awajicho. Any subway station is fine.[%p]
As long as we can get out of Akiba.[%p]
Staying out of sight is more difficult than I expected.[%p]
And the subway is farther away than I thought. I misjudged the distance to the station.[%p]
Maybe we should double back to Suehirocho Station. Or would that take us too close to the lab?[%p]
There’s no way of knowing where SERN’s men could be.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hide!”[%p]
I pull Mayuri into the entrance of a nearby building.[%p]
Several young men pass by. They’re not particularly fit, and each of them is carrying a bag full of computer parts.[%p]
I don’t think they’re the enemy. But I can’t be sure.[%p]
The only way to be safe is to treat every group of men as a potential threat.[%p]
At this rate, it’ll be night before we escape Akiba.[%p]
Maybe we should just go for it and hope to get lucky.[%p]
I look up the closest station with my phone.[%p]
Ochanomizu and Suehirocho are about equidistant from our current position.[%p]
Suehirocho takes us near the lab, but Ochanomizu is on the same line as Akihabara. It might be affected by the bomb threat.[%p]
An impasse.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, stay right here. Don’t move until I get back.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Where are you going?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“To the station to make sure it’s safe.”[%p]
And while I’m at it, scout the streets between here and there. We’ll need to use the shortest route.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii doesn’t want to be left alone...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll be right back. If I’m not back in 30 minutes, call someone. Kurisu or Suzuha. Have them get you out of Akiba.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Don’t say that! Come back, okay? If you don’t, Mayushii won’t know what to do...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Okay. I’ll come back. I promise.”[%p]
I leave Mayuri behind and run to Ochanomizu Station.[%p]
Wary of surrounding eyes, I scout the streets and decide that the back alleys of Kanda Myojin will give us the best chance of avoiding detection.[%p]
Once we make it to the station, we’ll just have to pray.[%p]
I race back to the spot I left Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri!”[%p]
She’s not there.[%p]
For an instant, I think I got the place mixed up, so I check the entrance of the next building.[%p]
But Mayuri isn’t there either.[%p]
She’s gone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I told her not to move!”[%p]
At first, I assume Mayuri just wandered off somewhere, like she often does. But then another possibility dawns on me.[%p]
Could SERN’s men have found her? Abducted her?[%p]
Would they do that?[%p]
Moeka said that Mayuri was unnecessary.[%p]
That’s why she killed Mayuri first.[%p]
So why would they kidnap her?[%p]
I don’t know.[%p]
The only thing I know is that Mayuri’s gone.[%p]
I knew I shouldn’t have left her alone.[%p]
I should have stayed by her side no matter what.[%p]
Still, I can’t give up. I scour the neighborhood for Mayuri.[%p]
But when I fail to find any trace of her, I return to the lab in despair.[%p]
It’s a mail from Moeka.[%p]
She’s on her way here?[%p]
When she says “we need to talk,” she probably means “I’m going to kidnap you and take the Time Leap Machine.”[%p]
Just as I’m about to delete the mail out of frustration, I notice there’s an image attached.[%p]
I swallow and open it.[%p]
It’s a scan of a foreign newspaper article.[%p]
There’s a rough black-and-white picture, along with a date.[%p]
February 28, 1961.[%p]
Fifty years ago.[%p]
It’s not in English.[%p]
I look at the picture.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A jellyman...”[%p]
The picture is of a jellyman embedded in the wall of a house.[%p]
Wait...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line][margin top="190"][center][font size="3220"]”AHHHHHHHHH!”[font size="1000"][%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Guh!”[%p]
A screeching fills my ears. Needles stab into my brain.[%p]
The shock lasts an instant, then the pain is gone.[%p]
A wave of nausea hits me. Vomit backflows into my mouth.[%p]
I swallow it back. My throat burns.[%p]
I leapt immediately after seeing the photo.[%p]
I couldn’t accept it. Not even for a second.[%p]
In the 20 minutes I took my eyes off of Mayuri, she was captured by Moeka’s men.[%p]
They took her to France and stuck her in the LHC.[%p]
They sent her through their unstable black hole 50 years into the past.[%p]
It wasn’t an experiment. It was just a warning. A threat.[%p]
How could anyone do such a thing?[%p]
Now that I’ve recovered slightly from the shock, I realize that Mayuri was probably still alive when Moeka sent me that picture.[%p]
A flight to France takes at least twelve hours, after all.[%p]
Even so, her fate was already [color index="A0140000"]decided[color index="800000"].[%p]
Perhaps that 50-year-old newspaper article appeared out of thin air the instant they found her.[%p]
I don’t know why her cause of death changed.[%p]
I don’t have time to investigate.[%p]
The only choice is to run.[%p]
Our enemies don’t consider Mayuri human.[%p]
I’m filled with rage.[%p]
I want to kill them.[%p]
I won’t let them have her![%p]
The clock shows 5:05 PM.[%p]
Not as much time left as I thought.[%p]
Come to think of it, the Time Leap Machine should be able to send me back to noon at least.[%p]
I’ll do that next time.[%p]
A chill runs up my spine. What am I thinking?[%p]
Next time? Have I already given up on saving her this time?[%p]
I shake my head to clear it of negative thoughts.[%p]
Judging by the time, Mayuri’s already left the shrine.[%p]
So I can’t contact her until she gets back to the lab.[%p]
All I can do is wait.[%p]
