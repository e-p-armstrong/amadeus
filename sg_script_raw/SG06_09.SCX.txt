As before, the Braun Tube Workshop closes early. Mayuri appears as Suzuha and Mister Braun are leaving.[%p]
We run through Kanda Myojin’s back streets to Ochanomizu Station, taking only minimal precautions to avoid attracting attention. We have to get there before the Sobu Line shuts down.[%p]
We manage to make it to the station without being stopped, but when we get there, I see a group of men waiting by the entrance. They look like SERN.[%p]
Change of plans. We turn around and head for the Shin-Ochanomizu subway station.[%p]
We arrive at the station later than I intended.[%p]
I don’t usually come here, so I got lost.[%p]
I stare nervously at the platform clock.[%p]
According to the scrolling display, the Yamanote, Keihin-Tohoku, and Sobu Lines have already suspended operations.[%p]
Wait... it looks like the Chiyoda Line has too.[%p]
It must be protocol to assume that nearby stations may be threatened, even stations on unconnected lines. [%p]
Damn![%p]
Mayuri hasn’t said a word about my strange behavior.[%p]
This is the third time I’ve led her on this escape, but each time, she follows me without complaint.[%p]
Does she really trust me that much?[%p]
Maybe she can feel my desperation.[%p]
That’s why I want so badly to save her.[%p]
We’ve been together for more than a decade. She’s like a little sister to me.[%p]
I’ll leap as many times as it takes.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...?”[%p]
Mayuri tilts her head quizzically. I realize that I’m staring at her.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Okarin? Mayushii has a lot of questions, but she’ll wait for now.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But once it’s over, I want you to tell me everything, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, I promise.”[%p]
Mayuri smiles happily at that answer.[%p]
That’s right. While we wait for the train, I should ask Mayuri about her whereabouts today.[%p]
If -- [color index="A0140000"]if[color index="800000"] -- I have to leap again, I’ll need all the information I can get.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where did you go after you saw Lukako?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I got an email from Fubuki-chan. A thread came loose on her costume.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I went to fix it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where does Fubuki-chan live?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, we met at the Starbecks at UPX.”[%p]
So that’s where she was.[%p]
Just then, an announcement plays over the PA system. The subway is resuming normal operations.[%p]
About 20 minutes have passed since we arrived.[%p]
I didn’t expect to be stuck here that long, but it’s okay.[%p]
Right now, Moeka should be in Akihabara, heading to the lab.[%p]
Everything is going to be alright.[%p]
While waiting for the train, I examine the route map on the station’s noticeboard.[%p]
We can transfer to an overland train at Yoyogi-Uehara. It’ll take a while, but that will take us all the way to Odawara.[%p]
Another announcement. Our train is arriving.[%p]
I can hear the rumbling and see the lights at the end of the tunnel.[%p]
Mayuri and I are standing just behind the white line.[%p]
I reach for her hand, meaning to make a dash for the train when the doors open, but I guess there’s no hurry now. I let my hand fall to my side, empty.[%p]
The roar comes closer.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“About the party tonight...”[%p]
Mayuri is saying something. I can’t quite hear her over the train.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It got canceled, but we should definitely--”[%p]
[name]???[line]“Mayuri♪”[%p]
Suddenly, Mayuri disappears.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
There she is, leaning out over the tracks. She’s off balance, as if she stumbled, or someone pushed her.[%p]
She seems to hang there for a moment, and then the train comes screaming into the station.[%p]
I hear a [color index="A0140000"]sound[color index="800000"] from under the train. I can’t describe it, but it makes me instantly nauseous.[%p]
Sparks fly as the train slams on its brakes.[%p]
The people on the platform scream.[%p]
I turn to where Mayuri was just a moment ago.[%p]
There stands a familiar girl.[%p]
Tiny, adorable, a cute black rabbit pouch slung over her shoulder.[%p]
Tennouji Nae.[%p]
She looks up at me.[%p]
Her eyes are wide.[%p]
Her lips tremble.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I...”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Saw... Mayuri...”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I wanted... to surprise her...”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“It wasn’t on purpo... it... wasn...”[%p]
She stares at me for a few more seconds, as if waiting for me to say something, then turns and runs away.[%p]
The platform is in chaos. The PA informs us that there’s been a ’personal injury accident.’[%p]
Nae is already gone. I don’t go after her.[%p]
Instead, I peek timidly through the gap between the train and the platform.[%p]
One side of the track... is a wash of red.[%p]
My mind is blank.[%p]
I can’t think.[%p]
I don’t even remember how I got back to the lab.[%p]
Moeka’s group should have come and gone, but the Time Leap Machine is still here.[%p]
I guess I should be grateful.[%p]
It takes longer than usual to set up the machine. For some reason, I have trouble recalling my own phone number.[%p]
At last, it’s ready.[%p]
Now... take me back.[%p]
