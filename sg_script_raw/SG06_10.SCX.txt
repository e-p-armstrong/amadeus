The leap occurs instantaneously.[%p]
Titor claimed that his time machine takes one hour of subjective time to travel ten years. I don’t know if ours has the same behavior, but now is not the time to find out.[%p]
Ten years...[%p]
I have no business that far back.[%p]
Besides, according to Kurisu, time leaping too far into the past could cause mental disorders due to the gap between personality and memory.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Juicy Chicken Number One♪”[%p]
Mayuri is singing her chicken song, though she’s actually eating precooked chicken from the convenience store, instead of her usual Juicy Chicken Number One.[%p]
She had to switch because she can’t warm up frozen chicken in the microwave, which is now a dedicated part of the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
...I was right to come back five hours.[%p]
Mayuri is still in the lab.[%p]
But what the hell happened back there?[%p]
It hurts, but I force myself to recall that horrifying scene.[%p]
Mayuri died again.[%p]
This time, it happened at Shin-Ochanomizu Station, a place completely unrelated to the lab or the bomb threat.[%p]
Tennouji Nae pushed her onto the tracks, where the train tore her to shreds.[%p]
Could Nae be working for SERN too?[%p]
No... No, that can’t be right.[%p]
Nae has a habit of jumping on Mayuri in greeting. She was probably just being her usual affectionate self.[%p]
But why did she choose that precise moment?[%p]
I don’t know.[%p]
I sense malice.[%p]
Whose malice?[%p]
It’s like fate is playing a cruel joke on us.[%p]
Whatever the case, all that matters now is that I have another chance. I need to act.[%p]
I have the power to save Mayuri. I will do whatever it takes to find a way.[%p]
This time, we hail a taxi on Chuo-dori.[%p]
It’ll be expensive, but that hardly matters now.[%p]
Mayuri comes along quietly.[%p]
I consider taking her home to Ikebukuro, but Moeka’s group might be watching her house. I have no idea where they are at this point in time.[%p]
Instead, I ask the driver to take us to Shinagawa.[%p]
However...[%p]
The traffic is unusually heavy.[%p]
The driver says it’s never been this bad before.[%p]
There must be an obstruction up ahead -- an accident or something. That’s the only explanation I can think of.[%p]
We’ve made it out of Akiba, but at this rate, it will take forever to reach Shinagawa.[%p]
I consider getting off here and taking the train, but then I remember what happened at Shin-Ochanomizu Station.[%p]
I have a bad feeling about this.[%p]
The traffic jam could be SERN’s doing. I look out the window and scan the crowd for anyone who might be a SERN agent.[%p]
Three hours later, we’re still stuck.[%p]
According to a conversation I overheard between our driver and another driver, there’s some kind of inspection up ahead.[%p]
Furthermore, it doesn’t seem to be a police inspection, and a small fight broke out at the inspection site or something.[%p]
To make matters worse, this road has already been closed off, and all the cars behind us are being detoured.[%p]
There are only about 100 cars waiting, but the inspection has been at a standstill for three hours.[%p]
This can’t be a coincidence. Once again, I feel the malice of fate, manipulating the situation.[%p]
Is Mayuri going to die again?[%p]
If I’d known it was going to turn out like this, I’d have ditched the taxi hours ago.[%p]
It’s not too late. I should pay the driver and get off right--[%p]
Just then, someone knocks on the window.[%p]
Our taxi is stopped in the middle of the road. What’s going on?[%p]
I look over, but before I can say anything, a man opens the rear door and gets in next to Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Eh...”[%p]
He’s holding a knife.[%p]
Another assassin![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, look out!”[%p]
Before she can reply, the man covers Mayuri’s mouth with a large, meaty hand.[%p]
I try to open my door, but it’s locked. Only the driver can open it from the inside.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...!”[%p]
Mayuri opens her eyes wide.[%p]
Her body twitches.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What--”[%p]
It all happens too fast.[%p]
The man sinks his knife into Mayuri’s chest.[%p]
A bright red spot stains her clothes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...”[%p]
[name]Man Who Stabbed Mayuri[line]“Be quiet, Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
Another man gets into the passenger seat.[%p]
He points a gun at the driver and says something to him.[%p]
Strength drains from Mayuri’s body.[%p]
Her eyes slowly close.[%p]
A tear rolls down her cheek.[%p]
I watch her die inches away, powerless to stop it.[%p]
I can feel her last breath against my skin.[%p]
They killed her again.[%p]
Why?[%p]
Why!?[%p]
Why can’t I save her!?[%p]
Why won’t you let me save her!?[%p]
Who decided that Mayuri must die!?[%p]
Moeka? SERN?[%p]
Or--[%p]
Does the world itself wish for Mayuri’s death?[%p]
I won’t accept that![%p]
I clench my jaw and throw myself forward, driving my forehead into the killer’s nose.[%p]
[name]Man Who Stabbed Mayuri[line]“Guh!”[%p]
He falls back. I shout to the driver.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Open the door!”[%p]
I crawl out of the taxi and take off running through the traffic jam.[%p]
After running for hours, I make it back to the lab. Luckily, the Time Leap Machine is still there.[%p]
I have to leap again.[%p]
Every time we run, Mayuri dies.[%p]
Six hours into the past, I clutch my head and wrack my brain for an answer.[%p]
I feel like I’ve hit a dead end.[%p]
What do I do if we can’t run away?[%p]
Is there no way to save her?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No! There has to be a way!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Whatcha talking about?”[%p]
Mayuri’s blank stare is the only answer I get.[%p]
This time, I take her to the closest police station and beg them to protect her.[%p]
When asked why, I explain that someone is going to kill Mayuri six hours from now, but without any proof that there’s someone after her, they have no choice but to turn us away. [%p]
It’s past six by the time we leave the station, and we’re left with no choice but to keep running.[%p]
I wish that I could blame my previous failures on bad luck. We could try Ochanomizu or Shinbashi again, and maybe this time she won’t die.[%p]
But I don’t have the courage to try those routes again. At the same time, we can’t stay in Akiba.[%p]
We’re running out of options.[%p]
Subways, trains, and taxis -- all out.[%p]
Attempting escape by those means will get Mayuri killed. So my heart tells me.[%p]
Perhaps the fear is irrational, but I can’t put it out of my mind.[%p]
I’ve seen her die a half-dozen times already -- shot, stabbed, torn to pieces.[%p]
I can’t go through that again.[%p]
We take refuge in Yodobashi Camera.[%p]
I thought we could keep hiding there indefinitely, but just after 7, we hear an explosion in front of the station.[%p]
Yodobashi goes into chaos.[%p]
Policemen appear and start evacuating the store.[%p]
When I try to explain our situation, an officer shouts “terrorist!” and pulls his gun.[%p]
This can’t be happening.[%p]
This isn’t America.[%p]
Japanese police officers don’t shoot without provocation.[%p]
Mayuri dies.[%p]
It happens so fast.[%p]
The policeman shoots her right in the head.[%p]
I don’t know if he was real policeman or a SERN assassin in disguise. It doesn’t matter.[%p]
I can’t deny it any longer.[%p]
The world itself is killing Mayuri.[%p]
