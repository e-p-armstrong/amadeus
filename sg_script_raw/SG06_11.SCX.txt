This time, I don’t leap into action immediately. Instead, I sit on the couch and collect my thoughts.[%p]
Every time I try to save Mayuri, it ends in the worst possible way.[%p]
To make matters worse, I no longer even know what I’m supposed to be saving her [color index="A0140000"]from[color index="800000"].[%p]
Cause and effect.[%p]
Why does Mayuri die?[%p]
At first, I thought that it was Moeka and her hit squad, sent by SERN to steal our time machine.[%p]
But as I leapt back in time again and again, the cause of Mayuri’s death kept changing.[%p]
At Shin-Ochanomizu Station, she died because Nae pushed her off the platform.[%p]
SERN had nothing to do with that. It was an accident.[%p]
Each time I leap, she dies a different way.[%p]
What does that mean?[%p]
I’ve been thinking for an hour, and I’m no closer to an answer.[%p]
I want someone to tell me, but who can I ask?[%p]
I’m the only person in history to leap through time.[%p]
...No, there’s one more. John Titor.[%p]
But he’s not replying to my emails anymore, and he hasn’t posted on @channel in days.[%p]
I’m not even convinced he’s a real time traveler.[%p]
I decide not to run this time.[%p]
Instead, I take a different approach. Strike first.[%p]
I send Moeka an email.[%p]
“I need to talk to you about our time machine. Meet me alone.”[%p]
I designate the roof of Radi-Kan as our meeting place.[%p]
Two weeks have passed since the satellite crashed, but it’s still there and the building’s still closed.[%p]
At least the security has lessened, so it’s easy for me to sneak in.[%p]
Not that there’s any sneaking to do. I just walk in through the front door like I belong there. No one questions me.[%p]
Last time I came here was for Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation.[%p]
Of course, on this worldline, the presentation was canceled.[%p]
Naturally, there’s nobody here but me.[%p]
It occurs to me that this is a dangerous gambit. Moeka might have a gun, and I already know that she’s willing to use it.[%p]
But then, I don’t intend to play fair either.[%p]
We’re supposed to meet at 5:30. It’s just after 5.[%p]
I came early in order to ambush her.[%p]
I hide in the shadows and wait with bated breath.[%p]
About thirty minutes later, I hear the door open.[%p]
Moeka makes her entrance, alone.[%p]
She looks around restlessly.[%p]
She still hasn’t noticed me.[%p]
I take a gun out of my shirt.[%p]
It’s not real.[%p]
It’s Future Gadget No. 1, the Bit Particle Gun.[%p]
It’s just a toy raygun with a remote control attached. Obviously a bluff, but all I could prepare on such short notice.[%p]
I run up behind Moeka and shove the Bit Particle Gun into her back.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t move.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hands up.”[%p]
Just like a Hollywood movie.[%p]
But this isn’t a movie. This is real.[%p]
And she isn’t an actress. She’s a murderer.[%p]
After Moeka raises her hands, I feel through her clothes.[%p]
Sure enough, she’s carrying a gun.[%p]
I take it from her and press it to Moeka’s back in place of the Bit Particle Gun.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry to disappoint you. The first gun was a toy.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Talk. I know you were sent by SERN.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...How?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How? You want to know how!?”[%p]
My frustration and rage boil over.[%p]
Because of her...[%p]
Because of her, Mayuri...![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I came from the future, that’s how!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You think I’m lying? I’ve repeated the last several hours a half-dozen times already.”[%p]
I’ve lost count of how many times exactly.[%p]
And I haven’t slept at all that entire time.[%p]
Strangely, I’m not tired at all.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know what you’re planning.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Around seven, you’re going to stop the trains.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka gasps.[%p]
So it was their doing.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I also know that you’re planning to attack the lab. You and your men.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And then you’re going to kill Mayuri!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Understand? I’m a time leaper.”[%p]
Moeka nods faintly.[%p]
I could kill her now. It would be easy.[%p]
But no. I need information.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who are you people?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Rounders.”[%p]
Moeka answers with surprising obedience.[%p]
I guess she values her own life, even though she has no problem depriving other people of theirs.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Rounders? What does that mean? How are you related to SERN?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...By email.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No! Speak.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“The Rounders...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...are an organization separate from SERN.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Covert operations.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“We don’t exist.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Like a private army?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...No.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Our mission...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...is to find and acquire IBN 5100s.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“They send us around the world.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“We collect them.”[%p]
IBN 5100s...[%p]
That’s right. When I met her, she was looking for an IBN 5100.[%p]
These days, they’re nearly impossible to find. People will pay millions just to own one.[%p]
Is that because SERN has been hunting them down?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How many Rounders are there?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Answer me!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I don’t know.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’m just an agent.”[%p]
So she’s not important enough to be told.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Was it you who stole our IBN 5100?”[%p]
Moeka doesn’t answer.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why does SERN need IBN 5100s? To keep hackers out?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Maintaining secrecy...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...is the highest priority...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...for SERN.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are they hiding?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We already know they’ve killed hundreds of test subjects with their time travel experiments. We didn’t need an IBN 5100 to find that out.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you saying the IBN 5100 database has information more sensitive than that!?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I don’t know.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Because you’re just an agent?”[%p]
My tone is sarcastic, but Moeka nods.[%p]
Damn! She’s useless.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why did you attack the lab? Or rather, why will you attack the lab?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Isn’t it obvious?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Because we hacked into SERN?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Three reasons.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“First. Because of what you know.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“We were ordered to silence you.”[%p]
So SERN did know about the hacking.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Second. For the time machine.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“The one you made.”[%p]
They want our time machine.[%p]
SERN must be trying to monopolize time travel technology.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Third. The reason it happens today.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You plan to make your time machine public.”[%p]
How does she know that?[%p]
We made that decision right after the Time Leap Machine was completed.[%p]
That was only a few hours ago.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“That’s why I was ordered... to take you in.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Take us in!? You killed Mayuri!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“She is... unnecessary.”[%p]
[color index="A0140000"]Unnecessary.[color index="800000"][%p]
I nearly pull the trigger.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Okabe, Makise, Hashida. You made the time machine.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“She is expendable.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Those are my orders.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And after you take us in? What then?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“SERN will hold you prisoner. Force you to complete their time travel research.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you done this before? How many lives have you ruined for SERN’s research?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...I do as I’m told.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I was a fool to consider you my friend.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...I live for SERN.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...I live for FB.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’ll do anything... if FB tells me to.”[%p]
FB?[%p]
Is that the name of her supervisor?[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Okabe-kun...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Is it you?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Are you John Titor?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What?”[%p]
John Titor?[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“There’s no one else it could be.”[%p]
Me?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t have time for this.”[%p]
I dig the gun into Moeka’s back.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you want to live, you’ll call your friends. Call FB. Cancel the attack.”[%p]
Moeka shakes her head.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I don’t have the authority.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t care! Find some way to stop the attack. Otherwise...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll kill you.”[%p]
I can’t do it.[%p]
I’m not a killer.[%p]
My hands are trembling, just like Moeka’s were before she shot Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why... why did you kill her?”[%p]
She was hesitating.[%p]
She didn’t want to pull the trigger.[%p]
But she did.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You didn’t want to kill her, did you? So why...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...just obey...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...FB.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then bring that son-of-a-bitch here!”[%p]
Moeka shakes her head again.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t care about your authority. If you don’t do what I say--”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...I can’t.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’ve never--”[%p]
Something hard stabs into my back.[%p]
A chill runs through my body.[%p]
There’s someone behind me.[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“Drop the gun.”[%p]
A man’s voice.[%p]
Is he with Moeka?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You lied, Kiryu Moeka!”[%p]
I’m ready to pull the trigger in cold blood.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We promised to meet alone!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka doesn’t answer.[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“I said drop the gun.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll give you the time machine. Just don’t kill anyone.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Even if you do that...”[%p]
Even though I’m still pointing the gun at her, Moeka steps away and turns to face me.[%p]
Her eyes are cold, her expression unreadable.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You’ll still be held prisoner.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Forever.”[%p]
Moeka takes the gun from my hand.[%p]
I’m unable to resist.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry about the hacking. Just please, don’t kill anyone.”[%p]
Something strikes the back of my head. My legs give out instantly, sending me to the ground.[%p]
Darkness creeps in.[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“Target B in custody. Requesting pickup.”[%p]
Deep down, I knew. I can’t save Mayuri.[%p]
Even if Moeka’s group doesn’t kill her, someone or something else will.[%p]
The world itself wants her dead.[%p]
That is the choice of Steins Gate.[%p]
...Steins Gate?[%p]
There’s no such thing.[%p]
Those words have no meaning. [%p]
It’s just some nonsense I made up to sound cool.[%p]
Steins Gate doesn’t exist, but fate does.[%p]
Fate. God. The will of the universe. An absolute force that no one can resist.[%p]
It exists, and it has sentenced Mayuri to death.[%p]
I wake up in the back of a station wagon.[%p]
The windows are coated with black film, so I can’t tell where we are.[%p]
I feel a throbbing pain in the back of my head.[%p]
My hands are tied behind me.[%p]
What time is it?[%p]
How long have I been unconscious?[%p]
There’s a man with me inside the car.[%p]
I recognize him from a previous time leap. He’s the one who stabbed Mayuri in the taxi.[%p]
The man seems to notice I’ve woken up, but he doesn’t speak.[%p]
He just waves his gun menacingly, as if to say that there’s no hope of escape.[%p]
The dashboard clock reads 7:30.[%p]
I look out the window again.[%p]
Through the film, I manage to make out a street sign.[%p]
We’re close to the lab.[%p]
Has the attack already happened?[%p]
Before I left, I told everyone, including Mayuri, to run.[%p]
If she did as I said, she won’t die by their hands.[%p]
But that doesn’t mean she’s safe.[%p]
If I don’t do something, Moeka’s going to take the Time Leap Machine away.[%p]
What will happen then?[%p]
SERN can have the machine, if it will save Mayuri.[%p]
The problem is that it won’t, not when the world itself is determined to kill her.[%p]
As long as the Time Leap Machine remains in my hands, I can keep trying to fix things.[%p]
I’ll leap again and again until I find a way to save her.[%p]
But if I lose the machine, then the future is decided.[%p]
A future without Mayuri.[%p]
I have to get to it before they do, even if that means I might get shot.[%p]
As long as I survive to reach the Time Leap Machine, everything will be alright.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aaaaahhhhhh!!”[%p]
My bound hands limit me to headbutts and kicks, but I somehow manage to knock down the man guarding me and escape.[%p]
My chest and neck are covered with blood. I must have been shot during the struggle, but thanks to the adrenaline pumping through my body, I barely feel any pain.[%p]
I can still move. That’s all that matters.[%p]
I run up the stairs with my hands still tied. I can only pray that I’ll be able to operate the Time Leap Machine quickly enough.[%p]
Mayuri, Kurisu, and Daru are in the lab.[%p]
So are Moeka and her men.[%p]
When I open the door and burst in, everyone looks at me in surprise.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
When she sees my tattered body, Mayuri runs up to me with tears in her eyes.[%p]
Wait![%p]
I try to stop her.[%p]
In the corner of my eye, I see Moeka take aim at Mayuri.[%p]
I try to put myself between them.[%p]
I try to cover Mayuri with my body.[%p]
But a man grabs me from behind and pulls me back.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ah!”[%p]
I watch, helpless, as Mayuri’s tiny body drops to the floor.[%p]
Her eyes, wide and wet with tears, seem to stare into mine.[%p]
But I can see that they have already lost their light.[%p]
She’s gone.[%p]
Again...[%p]
Again.[%p]
Again!![%p]
What happens next is the same as before.[%p]
Suzuha defeats the Rounders, and Kurisu helps me time leap.[%p]
