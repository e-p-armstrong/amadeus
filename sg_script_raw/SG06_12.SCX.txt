A flood of sound beats on my eardrums.[%p]
When it subsides, I find myself again in the lab.[%p]
It’s just before 5.[%p]
I have two and a half hours before Mayuri dies.[%p]
I find myself staring at the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
This thing is the reason for Moeka’s attack.[%p]
If only we had never built the PhoneWave.[%p]
If only we had never sent those D-Mails.[%p]
Perhaps the future might be different, instead of the nightmare it promises now.[%p]
Would anything change if I broke it? Just smashed it to pieces right here?[%p]
In a rush of delirium, I grab a chair and lift it high over my head.[%p]
Just as I’m about to bring it crashing down on this infernal machine, a voice cries out.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Stop, Okabe! What are you doing!?”[%p]
Kurisu grabs my arm and pulls me back.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you trying to break the machine?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You don’t have to [color index="A0140000"]break[color index="800000"] it, Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We already decided not to experiment. Remember?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, put the chair down.”[%p]
I lower the chair slowly.[%p]
Not because Kurisu told me to, but because I realized what would happen if I really did break the machine.[%p]
It caused -- or will cause -- Mayuri’s death, but at the same time, it is also my only chance of averting that future.[%p]
If I lose it, I lose my only hope of saving her.[%p]
The fear of that outcome stayed my hand.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You look pale. What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you listening?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I can’t deal with this. Not now.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“W-wait!”[%p]
I flee from the lab.[%p]
I don’t have a particular destination in mind.[%p]
People look at me strangely as I shuffle down the street. I imagine I must look like I crawled up from the grave.[%p]
Soon, I get fed up with the crowd around the station and escape to the pedestrian overpass.[%p]
I get about halfway across the bridge and squat down on the concrete.[%p]
The giant screen on the UPX building is advertising some gothic punk band. The ticker at the bottom displays today’s weather forecast along with the date and time.[%p]
I realize that today is Friday the 13th.[%p]
Is there no way to get through today without Mayuri dying?[%p]
It’s already 5:30. Two hours until the attack.[%p]
The lights around Akihabara Station turn on one by one as the sun sets.[%p]
The moe might be gone from Akiba, but the area around the station is still as posh as ever.[%p]
I don’t belong here.[%p]
The bridge I’m sitting on has become a date spot for couples. I see them standing here and there, gazing at the cityscape with their arms wound around each other.[%p]
Somehow, they never seem to tire of the dull, unchanging scenery.[%p]
What am I doing here?[%p]
Mayuri’s about to die.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey. Don’t you think you’re a little old to be sitting on the ground in public?”[%p]
I lift my head and see Kurisu standing there.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So this is where you went. I’ve been looking for you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Christina.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What time is it now?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“5:38.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey. If you have time to sit around, then you can help me with the shopping.”[%p]
Shopping...[%p]
Oh, right.[%p]
Preparations for the party.[%p]
In the original timeline, I went shopping with Kurisu at the UPX supermarket.[%p]
And then we talked on this bridge, just like now.[%p]
It feels like so long ago.[%p]
Back then, I had no idea what was about to happen.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well? Are you going to come along or not?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I sigh deeply.[%p]
I don’t believe that it was wrong to time leap.[%p]
However...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu.”[%p]
I keep my eyes lowered.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...That’s the first time you’ve said my name properly.”[%p]
I feel her eyes on me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Help me.”[%p]
I can’t save Mayuri alone.[%p]
I realize that now.[%p]
Reliving today again and again, only to taste the same despair each time, has taught me one important lesson.[%p]
Alone, I am powerless.[%p]
Alone, I have no hope.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Help me...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Tell me what happened.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I know you used the Time Leap Machine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What?”[%p]
I look up in surprise.[%p]
Kurisu doesn’t meet my stare. Instead, she leans on the guard rail and gazes down at the plaza with her usual frown.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You get a phone call, and suddenly you’re like a different person.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It was obvious.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I came from three hours in the future.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What happened?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They... killed Mayuri.”[%p]
I lower my head, trying to hold back the tears.[%p]
Then I explain about SERN and Moeka, and about how Kurisu herself activated the Time Leap Machine and made this possible.[%p]
I tell her about my previous leaps. I explain that the world itself wants Mayuri dead, that I can’t save her no matter how I try.[%p]
I keep talking for thirty minutes straight.[%p]
During that time, Kurisu hardly says a word.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...It’s all my fault.”[%p]
Talking to Kurisu lets me sort out everything I’ve done. Everything I’ve seen.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I shouldn’t have told Daru to hack SERN.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I shouldn’t have asked you to build a time machine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I shouldn’t have made Moeka a lab mem.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri’s death... is all my fault.”[%p]
That’s why I needed to bear the burden myself. [%p]
I was resolved to do whatever it took to save Mayuri, never faltering, never giving up.[%p]
And yet, my resolve has already crumbled.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you know that Mayuri’s going to die, then what are you doing wasting time here?”[%p]
Kurisu’s tone is haughty. Is this how I sound when I’m playing Hououin Kyouma?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I just don’t get it anymore.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What don’t you get?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How to save Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Based on what you said, I guess the chronology protection conjecture is true.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No matter what I do, Mayuri dies.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And that’s why you keep time leaping...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There’s no guarantee that the machine is safe, you know.”[%p]
Kurisu lowers her gaze and cups her chin, as she often does when assessing a problem.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Even if the machine works perfectly, repeated use may have serious side effects.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“For example, you may become disconnected from causality itself.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You need to understand the risks if you’re going to continue.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Disconnected from causality, meaning?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It happens all the time in sci-fi. You’ll become trapped in a closed time loop, never aging, never dying, but doomed to repeat the same day for all eternity.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Worst case, you may cease to exist entirely.”[%p]
What?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Every trace of your existence will vanish. Nobody will remember you, because your life will have never happened.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Leaping through time is that dangerous.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“’Humans are temporal beings.’”[%p]
Kurisu looks surprised.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Heidegger. I was thinking of that quote too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I heard it from you first.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“When?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This isn’t the first time I’ve leaped.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Right. Of course.”[%p]
Kurisu squats next to me, thinking deeply.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If what you said is true, then I want to save Mayuri too.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But as the co-creator of the Time Leap Machine, I can’t recommend its continued use.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Will you listen to my advice?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I...”[%p]
I can’t do it alone.[%p]
I know that now.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I need your help.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I have to save Mayuri! I can’t do it alone, but together, we might have a chance. I want... I need to believe that!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please, lend me your strength.”[%p]
Kurisu sighs.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re such a stubborn fool.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What you’ve been through... I’m surprised it hasn’t broken you already.”[%p]
Incredibly, she sounds concerned about me.[%p]
She looks at me for a moment, then turns away as if embarrassed.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ll help.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Mayuri’s my friend, and a fellow lab mem.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And besides... I don’t want to see you in such pain.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t apologize.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Remember when I told you about my father? You really helped me out back then.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Now it’s my turn to return the favor.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I want to be your strength.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Besides, you still have to come with me to Aomori.”[%p]
She smiles a wry but gentle smile, as if I were her mischievous younger brother.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I know you’re going to leap no matter what I say. You are a mad scientist, after all, and mad scientists play by their own rules.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey. Aren’t you supposed to go ’muhahahaha’ or something?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why do I even try?”[%p]
Kurisu is right. I’ll do anything to save Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, I’m not doing this for you, okay?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m doing it for Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, of course.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That, and I think you’ll make a good test subject.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now you’re talking like SERN.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s completely different.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How so?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I only experiment on you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Besides, mad scientists experiment on themselves all the time, don’t they?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I guess...”[%p]
I’m no longer afraid to time leap.[%p]
I’ll do anything to save Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I-it’s just a joke. Don’t take it so seriously.”[%p]
Kurisu stands up and looks at her watch.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There’s not much time. I think you should have a clear plan before trying to change the future again.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Meaning?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Leap to an even earlier time.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then explain the situation to me again.”[%p]
Kurisu’s right. My actions so far have been almost entirely random, and look where that’s gotten me.[%p]
I need a real plan if I’m going to save Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Let’s go.”[%p]
Kurisu stretches out her hand.[%p]
I grasp it and pull myself up.[%p]
Mayuri and Daru are already back when we return to the lab. Suzuha is there too. To get rid of them, Kurisu and I explain that we forgot to do the shopping, so could they please take care of it for us?[%p]
I have to cough up the money to convince them to go, but it works.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I understand why you can’t tell Mayuri, but why can’t you tell Hashida?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll tell him when it’s necessary.”[%p]
For now, it’s not, and I don’t have time to explain.[%p]
While Kurisu sets up the machine, I head downstairs to the Braun Tube Workshop, kick the door open, and turn on the 42-inch CRT.[%p]
That went more smoothly than I anticipated. It’s highly illegal, of course, but I’ll leap long before the cops get here.[%p]
Kurisu looks shocked when I return to the lab.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“They’ll throw you in the slammer for breaking and entering.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In a few seconds, it won’t have happened.”[%p]
Kurisu hands me the headgear and I put it on.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I see. That’s how it looks from your perspective.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What does it look like from my perspective? What happens here after you leap?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...You’ll know soon enough.”[%p]
My consciousness travels to the past. That, I know from experience.[%p]
But what about the body I leave behind?[%p]
If time is a straight line, then it’s likely that the present will be reconstructed based on my actions in the past.[%p]
But if the many-worlds interpretation holds, then after I leave, this world will continue on as if nothing happened.[%p]
I used to be so fascinated by the structure of the universe, but now I don’t really care.[%p]
All that matters is saving Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu’s fingers stop typing on the keyboard.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s nothing. I was just thinking.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe it works like a D-Mail.”[%p]
The instant we send a D-Mail, the present changes around us.[%p]
Thanks to Reading Steiner, only I remember what it was like before the change.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That would make things easier, though I kind of hope you’re wrong.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Because you can’t collect data if you can’t record the change?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Exactly.”[%p]
Kurisu nods and begins tinkering with the settings again.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I set the destination to five hours ago. You should arrive around 1:40 PM.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I completed the Time Leap Machine just after 2. Do you remember?”[%p]
Barely.[%p]
For Kurisu, that happened only five hours ago. For me, it feels like weeks. [%p]
Maybe it has been weeks.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Nobody likes a man who can’t remember dates.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Be thankful that I make a habit of checking the time. I have a pretty good idea what happened when.”[%p]
Kurisu finishes typing and turns to face me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Listen, Okabe. If you’re going to keep using the Time Leap Machine, there’s one thing you must remember.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t let go of your phone. Ever. It’s your lifeline. Your destination marker.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“As long as you keep it with you, you can leap to any time you want.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But if you lose your phone... if someone else gets ahold of it...”[%p]
Then if I leap to that time, my memories could overwrite theirs. I don’t want to imagine what might happen next.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If it breaks, or the battery dies...”[%p]
Then I won’t be able to leap to that time.[%p]
If it breaks, then I can get a new phone with the same number, but there will still be a period of time to which I can never leap.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The time leap will fail.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Once again, never let go of your phone.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Got it.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“After you leap back to this afternoon, just sit tight and don’t do anything until I complete the Time Leap Machine.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you accidentally prevent me from completing the machine, it will likely wreak havoc with the timeline.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“As soon as I finish, declare that we will not experiment. Then send everyone home.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ask me to stay. Tell me the truth. If you say you came from the future, I’ll probably believe you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How do you know?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Who knows me better than myself?”[%p]
Kurisu grins faintly and stands up after she’s done typing.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t forget. It was my mad skillz that turned the PhoneWave into a time leap machine.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“When you told me about your time leap, I took it as proof that my theories were right. I was happy it succeeded. I really was. I didn’t doubt it was true for a second.”[%p]
I see...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Just to be safe, I should probably give you a passphrase.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What I want the most right now is my own fork.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It doesn’t mean anything, okay!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You want your own fork?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I already have my own spoon... wait, that doesn’t matter!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Everything’s ready! Now get out of here!”[%p]
I nod and call up the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Be careful. And remember...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m always on your side.”[%p]
Kurisu touches my shoulder, then steps away.[%p]
