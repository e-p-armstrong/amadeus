I lie back on the sofa with my phone in my hand.[%p]
Needles in my brain.[%p]
A whining in my ears.[%p]
These sensations never get any easier to endure.[%p]
I look at the clock. It’s about 1:45. There’s a high-school baseball game on TV.[%p]
In about fifteen minutes, Kurisu will finish the Time Leap Machine. All it needs are some final adjustments, so there’s nothing for me to do but wait.[%p]
As the pain in my brain subsides, I realize that my head is throbbing.[%p]
Why?[%p]
Oh, I remember. Right before this, I had an argument with Mister Braun in which he introduced his fist to my skull.[%p]
Mayuri is at her sewing machine, working on her costume.[%p]
Daru is at his computer, collecting moe artwork from the internet.[%p]
Kurisu is in the development room, upgrading the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
I sit, motionless, as the minutes tick by.[%p]
Suddenly, the sound of the sewing machine stops.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin, Okarin! Can you come here?”[%p]
Mayuri shows me her costume.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Can you hold this for me? Spread it out like ’fwapp!’”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Mayu-shi, say ’fwapp’ again.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Fwapp!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I got a fwapp!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Stop it, perv.”[%p]
I follow Mayuri’s directions and spread the costume out by the sleeves.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hmm...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay! Thanks.”[%p]
Mayuri looks a little tired. She was working on this costume all night.[%p]
But then she smiles, brighter than the sun.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“All done♪”[%p]
...I said something here, didn’t I? What was it?[%p]
I can’t remember.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I finished before Chris-chan! We were racing.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You win, Mayuri. Congratulations.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But I’m finished too.”[%p]
Kurisu finishes connecting the two cords she’s holding.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Complete.”[%p]
Alright, that’s my cue.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’re not experimenting.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh!?”[%p]
Crap, was that too soon?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I just finished and you’re already shutting it down? What I have been doing these past three days?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Time leaping presents a host of problems. I want to consider them all carefully.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“H-huh. That’s... an unusually respectable opinion, coming from you.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Problems? I thought it was done?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll explain later. Everyone’s tired, so let’s go home.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We’re not going to have a party to celebrate?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’ll do that another day.”[%p]
I manage to convince Daru and Mayuri to leave.[%p]
I lend Mayuri my phone charger, since we use the same brand of phone.[%p]
Kurisu tries to go home too, but I quietly keep her back.[%p]
