[name]Kurisu[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you upset?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Yeah.”[%p]
Probably because I shot her down right after she finished the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
She’ll feel relieved later, but only after she has time to fully consider its implications.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I came from five hours in the future.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu spears me with a piercing glare.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Is that supposed to be funny?”[%p]
Her narrowed eyes make me believe that looks can kill.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“D-don’t glare like that! This isn’t right! You’re supposed to believe me!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What made you think I’d believe something like that!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You told me so! Five hours from now, okay!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t be ridiculous. I would never make such a baseless projection.”[%p]
I’d like to have a word with future Kurisu.[%p]
If this is how you’re going to be, then you leave me no choice but to quote you word for word.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When I told you about my time leap, you said, ’I took it as proof that my theories were right. I didn’t doubt it was true for a second.’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“’Don’t forget. It was my mad skillz that turned the PhoneWave into a time leap machine.’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t talk like that!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What you want most right now is your own fork!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wha--”[%p]
Kurisu’s face suddenly turns red.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You already have your own spoon, apparently.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“S-she said that? I’m gonna kill myself five hours from now...”[%p]
She appears genuinely shocked, for some reason, but I’m pretty sure she believes me now.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It feels like someone peeked into my heart. And that someone is Okabe, of all people.”[%p]
What does she think I’m going to do?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But I think I believe you. Tell me the details.”[%p]
I explain everything to Kurisu again.[%p]
I’m able to organize my thoughts better since this is my second time.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I see... If what you say is true, then we have a serious problem.”[%p]
There are five hours until Mayuri’s death. We need to come up with a plan before then.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Future me said that the chronology protection conjecture holds, but I don’t think that’s quite right.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That conjecture says that according to quantum theory, time travel is impossible due to the danger of disrupting causality.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But when you time leap, there’s no chance of a time paradox occurring.”[%p]
Two of me don’t exist at the same time, and I can’t bring anything with me to the past.[%p]
All that changes are the memories stored in my temporal lobe.[%p]
So at the very least, time leaping can’t cause a Grandfather Paradox.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So I was right.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The universe itself is censoring me, correcting any changes I try to make.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If that’s true, then time leaping can’t save Mayuri. Nothing you do will change the result.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I can’t accept that.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Neither can I. The world is trying to kill Mayuri? As a scientist, I refuse to believe such nonsense.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What about the many-worlds interpretation? I just need to observe the world where Mayuri doesn’t die.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The many-worlds interpretation... That might have something to do with how Mayuri’s means of death keeps changing.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But it’s supposed to be impossible for parallel worlds to observe each other. Why are you different?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Because of my esper power, Reading Steiner.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This is no time for your chuunibyou nonsense.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...There’s no other explanation.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’ve mentioned that Reading Steiner thing before. Were you actually serious?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why would I make up something like that?”[%p]
Our D-Mail experiments proved that I can somehow perceive changes in the timeline when they occur. It’s an ability only I seem to possess.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t know, but I don’t want to rely on something that may not even exist.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, you can’t control which possibilities you observe. Even if the many-worlds interpretation holds true, it’s unreasonable to expect that you’ll ever find a world where Mayuri doesn’t die.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait. We’re not getting anywhere. Instead of analyzing what I’ve [color index="A0140000"]done[color index="800000"], let’s think about what we can [color index="A0140000"]do[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Time leaping won’t change the result. I just said that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then what do we do!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Calm down.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How can I calm down!? Do you know how many times I’ve seen Mayuri die!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Covered in blood! Gasping for breath! The light fading from her eyes! Again... and again... and again...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And all I could do... was watch!”[%p]
I hear my teeth grinding in my skull. Recalling that despair, that feeling of utter powerlessness, makes me want to lash out at everything within reach.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Getting emotional won’t solve anything.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re only calm because you weren’t there!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...True. I don’t know what happens five hours from now. To be honest, it doesn’t feel real at all.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But it’s not like I don’t believe you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You have to stay strong, Okabe.”[%p]
Kurisu pats my arm. Her hand is warm and her touch is gentle.[%p]
How... American of her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Sorry.”[%p]
She’s right. Getting emotional won’t solve anything.[%p]
I need to calm down. Calm down...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What I don’t understand is how the cause can change but the effect can stay the same.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s like causality itself is broken.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Maybe Kiryu Moeka shooting her isn’t the real cause of her death. Maybe it’s something larger and less obvious.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“For example, maybe she dies because we invented a time machine, or because SERN discovered our hacking.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If that’s the cause, then it doesn’t really matter how she dies. Causality remains intact.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can that theory explain why Nae pushed her in front of a train?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh, right... hmm...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, the principle of causality is absolute. Deny that, and you deny all of physics.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There must be a distinct cause for Mayuri’s death.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So if we figure out what it is, then maybe we can save her.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Not necessarily.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The problem is when the causal event occurred.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If it happened too far in the past... then there’s nothing we can do.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I can travel to any time I had a cell phone, can’t I!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No. It’s still theoretical, but I believe that one leap with our machine has a maximum range of 48 hours.”[%p]
48 hours... I can only go back two days!?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why didn’t you tell me that before!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Before what? I just finished the Time Leap Machine, remember?”[%p]
That’s true...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Future you didn’t say anything about it either.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh, so that’s what you mean. Maybe she just didn’t have the chance.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So how come I can only leap 48 hours?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t know. Even I don’t understand everything that’s going on inside that thing.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But you can do consecutive leaps. That is, as long as the Time Leap Machine exists. For example, if the Time Leap Machine remains functional for ten straight years, you could leap back to this moment ten years from now.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Of course, it would take a total of 1825 leaps, so I don’t recommend it. Still, it’s theoretically possible.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then what’s the problem?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Weren’t you listening? I said, as long as the Time Leap Machine exists.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“When was the machine completed?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Ah.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Exactly. An hour ago. August 13th, 2010. 2:00 PM, or thereabouts.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It didn’t exist before then.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s impossible to use the machine before 2 PM today.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So what you’re saying is...”[%p]
Count 48 hours back.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t go back farther than 2 PM on the 11th!?”[%p]
Kurisu nods, her expression grave.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Most likely.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can’t you improve it!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eventually, maybe, but certainly not now.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’d need a real laboratory with real equipment. It would be expensive, which means we’d need sponsors.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And if we go looking, I’m pretty sure SERN would crush us.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’d say that’s proven by the fact that neither you nor I have leapt here from the far future yet.”[%p]
So basically...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We can’t do anything!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Even with the Time Leap Machine, we can’t stop SERN from killing Mayuri five hours from now!?”[%p]
At that moment, I hear a sound from outside the window.[%p]
What?[%p]
Is it Moeka!?[%p]
Did she overhear us!?[%p]
I dash to the window and look down at the street.[%p]
It’s Suzuha.[%p]
Her bicycle has fallen over, and she’s scurrying to pick it up.[%p]
Our eyes meet.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Huh?”[%p]
Why does she look so pale?[%p]
Her lips move slightly.[%p]
It looks like she’s whispering something, but I can’t make it out from here.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey!”[%p]
I call out to Suzuha, but she leaps on her bike and zips away.[%p]
She’s acting strange.[%p]
I smell a conspiracy.[%p]
Moeka was a spy. Could Suzuha be the same?[%p]
It’s too dangerous to trust anyone.[%p]
Suzuha has exhibited suspicious behavior, though not as much as Moeka has.[%p]
She’s openly hostile towards Kurisu, and she was able to take down SERN’s hit squad singlehandedly.[%p]
I wonder if this missing father of hers really exists.[%p]
Could he be the John Titor who’s been posting on the internet?[%p]
What is the meaning of the name Barrel Titor?[%p]
Instinct tells me that she knows something.[%p]
I dash out of the lab.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey! Where are you going!?”[%p]
I know I don’t have much chance of catching her on foot, but I have to try.[%p]
There’s something going on here.[%p]
This is a completely new sequence of events.[%p]
According to my memories of the future, Suzuha is supposed to remain at the Braun Tube Workshop until 6:30 this evening.[%p]
But when she overheard me talking to Kurisu, she suddenly took off like a bat out of hell.[%p]
This has to mean something.[%p]
