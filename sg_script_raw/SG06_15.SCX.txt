Suzuha’s already out of sight, but when she left, she was headed for Chuo-dori.[%p]
I wonder if her phone’s on.[%p]
Maybe I should just try calling her.[%p]
Come to think of it, this reminds me of something.[%p]
On the day she failed to meet her father, she disappeared without a word -- just an email saying “bye.”[%p]
I searched the town, but I couldn’t find her, so I sent a D-Mail that changed the past in order to make her stay.[%p]
I’m pretty sure I lost her near the station back then.[%p]
What happened on that timeline?[%p]
Where did Suzuha go after failing to find her father?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line][color index="8A0000"]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha! I need to talk to you!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line][color index="8A0000"]“...I’m sorry. It’s all my fault.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line][color index="8A0000"]“All because I acted like a spoiled child.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line][color index="8A0000"]“This time, I’m going.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line][color index="8A0000"]“Bye.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey! Suzuha! Wait!”[%p]
It’s happening again. She’s going to disappear.[%p]
Last time, I lost sight of her near the station.[%p]
I search up and down Chuo-dori, but find no trace of Suzuha or her bike.[%p]
I have to be careful. There could already be Rounders here in Akiba.[%p]
I comb the area around the station’s main exit, but there’s no sign of her anywhere.[%p]
I lost sight of her here before, so I thought she might be close by.[%p]
Maybe I should corner her on my next time leap, press her for answers before she can escape.[%p]
I’d better get back to the lab.[%p]
I start walking away from the station, but just then--[%p]
The people around me gasp and point.[%p]
Everyone’s looking up at the sky.[%p]
No, not the sky.[%p]
The satellite embedded in the roof of Radi-Kan.[%p]
Why now?[%p]
It’s been there for two weeks. It’s practically a landmark now.[%p]
But everyone looks like they’re seeing it for the first time.[%p]
So I turn and look up too.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...”[%p]
The lights on the satellite are blinking.[%p]
Is someone inside?[%p]
Who?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha? Or could it be Moeka!?”[%p]
The satellite has remained silent through all of my previous time leaps.[%p]
What has changed?[%p]
Obviously, the fact that Suzuha overheard my conversation with Kurisu.[%p]
Previously, I lost sight of her at the station -- in other words, right next to Radi-Kan.[%p]
Suzuha must be up there![%p]
Everyone’s staring at the satellite. This is my chance to sneak in without being noticed.[%p]
The shutters are half-open, just as they were when I confronted Moeka.[%p]
I summon my courage and crawl through the crack.[%p]
When I get inside, the first thing I see is Suzuha’s bike lying on the floor.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So it is her!”[%p]
What is she trying to do?[%p]
What is that satellite?[%p]
How is it related to John Titor?[%p]
Is it even a satellite? Nobody knows for sure.[%p]
I checked online. No satellites fell out of orbit that day.[%p]
When they do, whether by accident or design, they usually burn up in the atmosphere.[%p]
It’s impossible for one to land in such perfect condition.[%p]
So what is it, then?[%p]
A jolt suddenly runs through my body.[%p]
Could it be... a time machine!?[%p]
There’s only one way to know for sure.[%p]
I need to get there before Suzuha does something![%p]
The elevator and escalator aren’t operating, so I bound up the stairs two at a time.[%p]
My lungs gasp and my legs burn, but I force my body to carry me to the top.[%p]
There’s the satellite, lodged in Radi-Kan’s roof. I notice wires holding it in place. The police must have done that so it wouldn’t fall.[%p]
There’s a hatch open on the side of the machine. I see someone moving inside.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha!!”[%p]
The person freezes when I shout.[%p]
I run to the satellite.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okabe Rintaro...”[%p]
Suzuha turns to me with a sad expression.[%p]
Behind her, I can see the interior of the satellite.[%p]
It’s surprisingly simple, without the switches and buttons you’d expect.[%p]
Instead, there’s a black box the size of a desktop PC. There are numbers on the screen -- “2010.08.13,” and below that, “1975.08.13.”[%p]
Suzuha reaches out to press a button.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ow!!”[%p]
Sparks burst from the panel. She jerks back, her fingertips burned.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...It’s not working.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You know how to use that thing?”[%p]
She doesn’t reply. I see her shoulders sag.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s not working...”[%p]
Those sparks had to be from an electrical short. My eyes are burning from the smoke.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Answer me, Amane Suzuha.”[%p]
I swallow hard, then ask the question.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is a time machine, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you a time traveler?”[%p]
With her head hung low, Suzuha nods.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“John Titor.”[%p]
There’s still a big crowd outside, so we exit the building on the side facing away from the station.[%p]
Suzuha has calmed down a bit, so I start pressing her for answers.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean, you’re John Titor?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Exactly what it sounds like.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m the John Titor who’s been posting on @channel.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I thought he was a guy.”[%p]
Suzuha smiles humorlessly.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I fooled you? Guess my camouflage worked, then.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who are you hiding from?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...SERN.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Those stories you posted... were they...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“True? Mostly. A few exceptions.”[%p]
It’s those exceptions that bother me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So you came from 2036, and that satellite... that’s your time machine.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I was hoping you wouldn’t find out, but my time machine went and broke on me.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I really screwed up, huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I thought Titor’s time machine was loaded on a Chevy.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Chevy? That’s a car, right? Where’d you hear that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The Titor in 2000 said so.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“2000?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That might be me on a different worldline.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“At least, I haven’t been to 2000. I came straight here from 2036.”[%p]
So it was someone else?[%p]
It’s true that Titor never posted in 2000, not on the current worldline.[%p]
It doesn’t matter. I can worry about that later.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you know?”[%p]
I press Suzuha for answers, trapping her between me and the wall so she can’t escape.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You overheard my conversation with Kurisu, right? Why did you run to the time machine? What were you trying to do?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I thought it was my fault.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Because I neglected my mission, SERN was able to put their plan in motion.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Is it true!?”[%p]
Suzuha suddenly grabs my shoulders.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Is it true that SERN kills Shiina Mayuri?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s true. I time leaped from five hours in the future.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Time leaped...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So you guys completed your time machine...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I need answers! What do you mean it’s your fault!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha bites her lip and looks away.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ll tell you everything.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I think you need to know. You... and Makise Kurisu.”[%p]
Kurisu?[%p]
Why Kurisu?[%p]
I’ll guess I’ll find out if I let Suzuha talk.[%p]
We should head back to the lab.[%p]
But first...[%p]
I offer Suzuha my handkerchief. She looks at me for a second, then takes it and ties it around her burned hand.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Thanks.”[%p]
