She should probably see a doctor about her hand, but there’s no time for that. Mayuri’s death is approaching.[%p]
I just hope she’s not in too much pain.[%p]
I wrap a towel around her hand to keep people around us from staring.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Welcome back, Okarin! Oh! Suzu-san’s with you too♪”[%p]
When we get to the lab, Mayuri and Daru are there for some reason.[%p]
I thought I sent them home![%p]
Mayuri gives me a ditzy answer when I ask them.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I really thought we should celebrate the birth of Super PhoneWave-chan!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So Daru-kun and I went shopping♪”[%p]
I should have known she wouldn’t stay away.[%p]
Kurisu looks as worried as I am. She leans close and whispers into my ear.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“W-what do we do?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Make absolutely sure Mayuri doesn’t find out.”[%p]
Kurisu nods slightly.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What are you guys whispering about?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Um...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How many times do I have to say it? No party!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Come on, Okarin. That’s no fun!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not about fun.”[%p]
I glance at Suzuha.[%p]
She’s still looks depressed.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Suzu-san? Are you feeling okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha, Christina, and I have important matters to discuss. That’s why I asked you to leave for the day.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii wants to hear too!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Um, I think he’s serious.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But Suzu-san looks sad... Mayushii’s worried...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Sorry.”[%p]
Suzuha hangs her head and bites her lip.[%p]
I know she feels responsible for Mayuri’s death.[%p]
But how is she related? That’s what I’m here to find out.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I want Shiina Mayuri and Hashida Itaru to stay. This concerns them too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
If Suzuha says so, then I have no objections.[%p]
But I quietly pull her aside and remind her not to tell them about Mayuri’s impending death.[%p]
Then I quickly explain Suzuha’s true identity -- that she posted on @channel as John Titor, that the “satellite” is really a time machine, that she came from the year 2036.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“A girl from the future? That’s awesome! Can I shake your hand?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’re not playing around here, Daru.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What year were you born?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“2017.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s in seven years... You haven’t been born yet, but you’re here. Uh... huh???”[%p]
There’s no time to deal with Mayuri’s confusion.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alright, Suzuha. Let’s hear it.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Well, the gist is what I posted on @channel.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I came from future, the year 2036. In my time, the world is a dystopia ruled by SERN. There’s no war, no conflict, but no freedom either.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Diss-tope-ear?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“A society where every activity is controlled by the government. In a dystopia, you’re not allowed to eat bananas unless today is banana-eating day. If you break that rule, they throw you in jail without a trial.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s terrible! Mayushii loves bananas...”[%p]
Forget about the bananas.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m part of the Resistance fighting to free humanity from SERN’s control.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I came to the past to change my present.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“From your point of view, I guess I should say the future. To change the future.”[%p]
Change the future...[%p]
She doesn’t sound like she’s joking.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, what about finding your father? Was that a lie?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha doesn’t answer.[%p]
Does that mean it was a lie?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“SERN is a research institution. They don’t have political power. I explained that to John Titor several times online.”[%p]
...Online?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Wait, don’t tell me. You’re ’KuriGohan and Kamehameha’!?”[%p]
Kurisu turns red and looks away.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Titor came forward, so it’s only fair that I do too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In that case, I’ll come clean too. I was posting under my true name, Hououin Kyou--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu & Suzuha[line][center]”I know.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ah, you harmonized♪”[%p]
Suzuha frowns. She must not like having anything in common with Kurisu.[%p]
She clears her throat and continues.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“SERN is still a research institution in 2036.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The world is actually ruled by SERN’s secret backers, the Committee of 300.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The Committee of 300... They’re real?”[%p]
That name was in SERN’s top secret documents.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“When SERN successfully completed their time machine, they became the sole entity with power over the fourth dimension, Time.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“In just two years, they remade the world to serve their purpose.”[%p]
Just two years... but that’s only in objective time. I bet SERN’s time travelers spent many decades leaping back and forth across history, building the foundation of SERN’s rule.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That brings us to you, Makise Kurisu.”[%p]
Suzuha glares at Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“In 2036, you’re apotheosized as the mother of the time machine.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Apotheosized?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“In Japanese, please.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Apotheosized. As in revered, respected.”[%p]
She keeps using unusual vocabulary. Or maybe that’s normal vocabulary in 2036?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Respected? Huh!? I-I am!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“In 2010, you pioneer time leap technology. Afterwards, you contribute to the development of SERN’s time machine. That’s what I know about Makise Kurisu.”[%p]
Is that why she treats Kurisu like an enemy?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then I must be the father of the time machine, right?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okabe Rintaro is a terrorist in 2036. You’re pretty infamous.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...”[%p]
Seriously?[%p]
I’m a terrorist in the future!?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I help SERN build their time machine? I don’t believe it.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“SERN experiments on people against their will. They’re a disgrace to scientists everywhere. I would never collaborate with them.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But that’s how it is in the future.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“How did the future me explain herself?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“We’ve never met. By 2036, you’re already dead... sorry.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well... that’s just great.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t even make it to fifty?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“In my time, there are two kinds of people: those who live extremely long lives, and those who die young, under suspicious circumstances.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“People who act against SERN are erased.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“T-they erased me?”[%p]
Suzuha looks into Kurisu’s eyes. For once, she’s not glaring at Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Maybe you were being used by SERN too. Maybe they took your parents hostage and forced you to work on their time machine.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No... does that mean Mama’s in danger?”[%p]
Kurisu’s mother is in America. It’s not terribly difficult to imagine SERN kidnapping her while Kurisu is away.[%p]
After all, I watched Moeka kill Mayuri in cold blood.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Rounders.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What’s that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“SERN’s private army. Or something like that.”[%p]
Suzuha nods.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“On paper, they’re an independent technology research firm. In reality, they do the dirty work for SERN all over the world.”[%p]
According to Moeka, they have two chief duties.[%p]
First, to acquire IBN 5100s, the only computers that can access SERN’s secret database.[%p]
Second, to find promising scientists in the field of time travel and force them to cooperate with SERN, or eliminate them if they will not.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So they already exist. I thought they might. In my time, they’re our number one enemy.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“D-dirty work? Does that mean like... kidnappings and assassinations?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha looks to me with a question in her eyes.[%p]
I shake my head.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“In my time, yes. But I don’t think they’ve reached that level in this time yet.”[%p]
Daru is visibly relieved.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Amane-san. You said that most of what you posted as John Titor was true, right?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Right.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Does that mean you know how the universe works? You claimed that the Everett-Wheeler model -- the many-worlds interpretation -- is correct.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That was a lie. Camouflage so that SERN wouldn’t target me.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If I mix one lie into the truth, then the bad apple spoils the barrel.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So you don’t know.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I do. By 2036, scientists have successfully modeled the structure of the universe. And it’s not the many-worlds interpretation.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Really? Tell me!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Attractor Fields...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Right. I told you by mail, didn’t I?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What sort of model is that?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The universe is made up of worldlines and attractor fields.”[%p]
Suzuha walks over to Mayuri’s sewing table and picks up a ball of red yarn.[%p]
She holds one end of the yarn and drops the ball to the floor, then holds about a meter of yarn in front of her face.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The universe is like this piece of yarn.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Countless possible worldlines exist side by side, branching out to infinity.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“From a distance, it looks like a single string, but when you look closer, the string is actually made up of individual threads woven together.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“At the end, those threads converge on a single point. The paths are different, but the destination is the same.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Isn’t that [color index="820000"]determinism[color index="800000"]?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Close. This model is a little looser.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You could say it cherry-picks from the many-worlds interpretation and the Copenhagen interpretation.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If the branches all lead to the same place, does that mean there’s only one world in the end?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Exactly.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The bundle of worldlines that share a point of convergence is called an attractor field.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“There are also many attractor fields.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“This string is Attractor Field Alpha. The threads are Alpha worldlines.”[%p]
Suzuha then cuts meter lengths of blue, yellow, and white yarn.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Blue is Beta, yellow is Gamma, and white is Delta.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Each is made up of countless Beta worldlines, Gamma worldlines, or Delta worldlines.”[%p]
She twists the different colored strings together, then stretches them out as one fat, multicolored string.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Attractor fields are superpositioned like this.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“In each attractor field, the worldlines converge on a different result.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“They don’t interact. Each attractor field is independent of the others.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Of course, they all diverged from a common point somewhere in the past, and they will all converge again at some point in the future, but that takes many hundreds of years.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You can think of the attractor fields as very long worldlines.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Can you compare it to an eroge? Teach me, oh erotic one.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“T-there’s no erotic one here!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, he’s right. It is like an eroge. Each heroine’s route is an attractor field, and the small choices within are the individual worldlines.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But at the end, they all enter the true route for the grand ending.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“The only difference is the length of the common parts. By the way, I’d choose the little sister’s attractor field.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whatever.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You guys are hopeless. Better do something quick.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Umm, I don’t know what you guys are talking about...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Just ignore them.”[%p]
Let me get this straight.[%p]
The reason I can’t save Mayuri... is that her death is the event upon which this attractor field converges?[%p]
But that means...[%p]
That means the world really [color index="A0140000"]is[color index="800000"] killing Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But then, isn’t it impossible to change the future? It always converges in the end, right? No matter what you do, the result is the same.”[%p]
That’s right. That’s why Mayuri dies no matter how many times I leap.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“We have to escape Attractor Field Alpha.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Escape?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“In other words, we’re going to jump to a worldline in Attractor Field Beta.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I thought attractor fields couldn’t interact.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Attractor fields are normally separate, but if we go to the instant they diverge...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The instant they diverge... is that now?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I was taught that a major divergence occurs in 2010.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“This year, an earth-shattering event causes divergence at the attractor field level. The last time such a divergence occurred was in the year 2000, and before that, in 1991.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Umm, what happened those years?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Events that changed the face of the world.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“1991 was the collapse of the Soviet Union, right? But what happened in 2000? 2001 had the 9/11 attacks...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The Year 2000 Problem.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Y2K? But that was just hype. Nothing happened.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s because the Alpha worldline we’re on represents a world where Y2K didn’t occur.”[%p]
So in other words, there are worlds where it [color index="A0140000"]did[color index="800000"] occur?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And that brings us to 2010.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Did something big happen this year?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What else could it be...”[%p]
Suzuha looks towards the development room.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But the creation of humanity’s first time machine?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh yeah! Wow!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“One more question.”[%p]
Kurisu keeps plowing ahead.[%p]
I guess that’s what makes her a scientist.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“These worldlines aren’t [color index="820000"]parallel worlds[color index="800000"], are they?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No. Ultimately, they’re just possibilities that exist simultaneously.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then how do you observe the differences between worldlines? Wouldn’t you need a god’s eye view to do that?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Normally. However...”[%p]
Suzuha looks at me.[%p]
...Don’t tell me![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Reading Steiner!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Is that what you call it? Okabe Rintaro, you have the power to observe changes across worldlines. Correct?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s the key.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Your power is the key to freeing the world from SERN’s rule.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You have the power of a god.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“My power...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If you escape Attractor Field Alpha and reach a Beta worldline... then the result will change.”[%p]
I feel a shiver of excitement.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So there’s hope?”[%p]
I can save Mayuri?[%p]
Suzuha nods firmly.[%p]
Then I must do it.[%p]
I have no choice.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wait a second.”[%p]
Kurisu, however, is not so enthusiastic.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“How do we know this is all true? What if Amane-san is just making stuff up?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What!? I’m not making stuff up!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Calm down. I’m not trying to pick a fight.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But I still have questions. One, how do you know about Okabe’s power? Two, how did you know Okabe and I were in Akihabara in 2010?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t you know a little too much for someone born in 2017?”[%p]
She has a point.[%p]
Everyone looks to Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...It was written in Dad’s will.”[%p]
His will?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“His will was what made me decide to time travel.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“My dad was one of the founding members of the Resistance. He hid from SERN and researched time travel on his own.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“He wanted to change the future.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But SERN killed him.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s why I’m here. To fulfill his dream.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I’m sorry.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha doesn’t look at Kurisu.[%p]
She still seems to have a grudge against her.[%p]
Kurisu would never actively cooperate with SERN. I know that, but I just can’t say it in front of Suzuha.[%p]
For some reason, Suzuha really does see Kurisu as responsible for the problems of the future.[%p]
But if that’s the case, why doesn’t Suzuha just kill Kurisu? Wouldn’t that change the future too?[%p]
Maybe she can’t.[%p]
Worldlines converge.[%p]
No matter how hard I struggle, Mayuri dies.[%p]
Similarly, it may be impossible for Suzuha to kill Kurisu... no matter how much she may want to.[%p]
Suzuha clears her throat as if to change the subject.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Akihabara, 2010. The time machine created here accelerates SERN’s own time machine research.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“We have to stop that from happening in order to guide history in a new direction.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Stop it? How?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“SERN already knows about us.”[%p]
That’s clear from Moeka’s attack.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Dad believed that the ultimate cause was the very first email you sent with your time machine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“An email? It wasn’t because they caught us hacking?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Like I said, nobody can catch my hacking.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Which email are you talking about?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, I know! Wasn’t it the email Okarin sent that said Chris-chan died?”[%p]
Right. The email I sent to Daru right after Doctor Nakabachi’s conference.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh, that...”[%p]
Back then, we hadn’t yet realized that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) was a time machine.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“SERN probably intercepted that email and realized what it meant.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They were already on to us back then?”[%p]
Come to think of it, the first time I met Moeka was the day after I sent that email.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We really jumped in the deep end, huh...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s good at the breaststroke!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Alright, then do a sexy underwater pose.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But how did they intercept our email? Hundreds of millions of emails are sent around the world each day.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“SERN uses the [color index="820000"]Echelon[color index="800000"] network to collect communications pertaining to time travel research worldwide.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Echelon!? It really exists!?”[%p]
As an expert on conspiracies, I understand the implications, and they terrify me. No one else seems to get what Suzuha’s saying, though.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Echelon sees everything. Any transmission that even hints at time travel is filtered and sent to SERN.”[%p]
For example, an email that appeared to have come from the future.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“We need to find the record of that email in SERN’s database and delete it.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If you do that, then SERN will never know you exist. Their time machine won’t be completed in 2034. If we’re lucky, the program may be shut down entirely.”[%p]
In other words, deleting that data will take us to the attractor field where SERN doesn’t build a time machine.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm... there wasn’t any data like that when we hacked SERN’s database.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course! SERN’s IBN 5100 database!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s probably where they store the data from Echelon.”[%p]
So that’s what it is![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Dammit, Daru! Why didn’t we use the IBN 5100 earlier!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uh... we never had one?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you talking about!? I got one, remember!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Right... That was on a different worldline.[%p]
On this worldline, I never found the IBN 5100.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“My mission is to make sure you acquire an IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You have one!?”[%p]
Suzuha shakes her head.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m going to 1975 to obtain one.”[%p]
1975. The year the IBN 5100 went to market.[%p]
I know because the John Titor in 2000 said that was his mission.[%p]
Was that John Titor Suzuha too?[%p]
Anyway, if Suzuha can get us an IBN 5100, then we can leave this attractor field and jump to a Beta worldline, where SERN never finds us and their time machine is never completed.[%p]
Mayuri won’t have to die.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alright! We need to move fast. How soon can you leave, Suzuha?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I was trying to leave when you caught me, but...”[%p]
Suzuha bows her head apologetically.[%p]
I look at her burnt hand. She’s hiding it from Mayuri and Daru, but I can see the blood staining my handkerchief.[%p]
It hurts to look at. Maybe we should get her to a doctor.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Right... your time machine’s broken.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Can you fix it?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No. I just ride it. My dad’s the one who built it.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ve memorized the manual, so I know how it works, but...”[%p]
That doesn’t mean she knows how to repair it, and there’s no guarantee that a time machine from 2036 can be repaired with today’s technology.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Maybe we can use the Time Leap Machine to go back before Amane-san’s time machine broke.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, you’re going to use the Time Leap Machine? Wasn’t the plan not to experiment?”[%p]
I still haven’t told Daru about my time leaping. There’s no time to explain.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’ll use it if the situation demands. Do you know when it broke, Suzuha?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No... but it was probably the rain a few days ago. It’s supposed to be airtight, but the inside was all wet when I checked it today.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Maybe it made a hole when you crashed into Radi-Kan?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That wasn’t a crash. The coordinates were slightly off, so it just appeared there.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s not exactly the most stable machine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyone remember when it rained?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The morning of the 10th. Just before dawn.”[%p]
The Time Leap Machine can only cover 48 hours in a single leap.[%p]
And the Time Leap Machine was completed today, the 13th, at 2 PM.[%p]
That means we can’t go farther back than 2 PM on the 11th.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn! We can’t get there with the Time Leap Machine!”[%p]
I thought we had a glimmer of hope...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I think we should try to fix it.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah! It’s a time machine, so we have plenty of time, right?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu, Suzuha, and I say nothing.[%p]
We know.[%p]
In less than two hours, Mayuri will die.[%p]
It’s already 5:30.[%p]
There’s barely enough time to sneak into Radi-Kan, let alone fix Suzuha’s time machine.[%p]
Maybe I should leap now to 2 PM on the 11th. Then we’ll have two full days to fix the machine.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re all hungry, aren’t you? You should be.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What’s this all of a sudden?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s hungry!”[%p]
As expected from a glutton.[%p]
I take a 10,000 yen bill out of my wallet.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, Daru. I leave the shopping to you. We can come up with a plan while we eat.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow, Okarin! What are we going to do with all this money?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Buy food. Lots of food. Use it all!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You just calmly hand over a 10,000 yen bill... wow, Okarin, you make it look easy! That’s why we love you! That’s why we admire you!”[%p]
Mayuri and Daru leave in high spirits. I knew the 10,000 yen bill would work.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina. Titor.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Titor? Is that me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who else?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Why are you calling me that now?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Because you’re the one behind Titor’s mask.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Well, yeah, but...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Just give up. Okabe rarely calls anyone by their name.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh yeah. He always calls me ’Part-Time Warrior’ for some reason.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Listen, you two. I’m going to leap to 2 PM on the 11th.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“After Titor explains herself again, we’ll start repairs on the time machine. Our goal is to have it working by this time today.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Is that the best plan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s better than trying to fix it when we only have two hours left. If it doesn’t work, I’ll just keep repeating the same two days.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...I’m sorry.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Titor. We’re counting on you to get us an IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Never forget. I’m not doing this for you, and I’m not doing it for the future. My mission is to save Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Call me self-righteous if you want. However...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m doing this my way.”[%p]
Kurisu and Suzuha give an encouraging nod in agreement.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Good. Then let’s begin.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re not going to name the operation?”[%p]
Who cares about that?[%p]
This isn’t a game. Mayuri’s life hangs in the balance.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You couldn’t find a good Norse mythology-themed name?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Why Norse mythology?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t think there’s a deep meaning behind it. Chuunibyou patients just love Germanic names for some reason.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Now that you mention it, most of our operation names in the Resistance have Germanic names too. Whenever I ask, they say it’s tradition.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So there’s still chuunibyou in 2036...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Cut the chatter!”[%p]
Mayuri’s life hangs in the balance.[%p]
There’s no time for this nonsense![%p]
Kurisu sets up the Time Leap Machine while Suzuha goes to turn on the 42-inch CRT.[%p]
Well before Mayuri returns, I leap.[%p]
