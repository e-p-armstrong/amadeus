When I come to, I’m standing with my phone in hand.[%p]
While I wait for the ringing in my ears to subside, I check the date and time on my phone screen.[%p]
August 11th, 2:21 PM.[%p]
Alright. Now I have two more days.[%p]
As a matter of fact, I leapt twice. First to 2 PM on the 13th, when the machine was completed. From there, I leapt an additional 48 hours to 2 PM on the 11th.[%p]
It was my first consecutive leap, but it seems to have gone well.[%p]
I immediately head downstairs to see Suzuha.[%p]
I’m relieved to see that her hand isn’t burned.[%p]
When I explain the situation, Suzuha races to Radi-Kan to confirm my story. [%p]
After she realizes that I’m telling the truth, I take her back to the lab and have her repeat the explanation she gave us before I time leaped.[%p]
We come to the conclusion that all we can do right now is try our best to repair Suzuha’s time machine.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Let’s go take a look!”[%p]
Daru is unusually enthusiastic.[%p]
I guess Suzuha’s talk of attractor fields and divergence and correcting history’s mistakes got his blood pumping.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“H-hold on, everyone!”[%p]
Mayuri stops us as we’re about to leave the lab.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, guys? Aren’t we forgetting something?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Like what?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What about Suzu-san’s dad?”[%p]
Oh, right.[%p]
I thought Suzuha was lying about that.[%p]
But when I turn to her, she looks away.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...That doesn’t matter now, does it?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It does too! I mean, it’ll take time to fix the time machine, won’t it? We should help Suzu-san find her dad in the meantime!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But...”[%p]
When I show reluctance, Mayuri’s puffs out her cheeks.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Don’t be like that, Okarin! You have to keep your promise.”[%p]
What promise?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“We promised, remember? We said we’d all look for Suzu-san’s dad.”[%p]
That’s right...[%p]
We convinced her to stay by promising to help look for her father.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah... I remember.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I know Suzu-san has a mission and stuff, but I think she also came because she really wanted to meet her dad.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii wants to make that happen!”[%p]
If Mayuri feels that strongly about it, there’s no way I can refuse.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Shiina Mayuri... you’re such a nice girl...”[%p]
Suzuha sniffles.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...You’re right.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I thought I could find him if I came to this town.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I know that he was in Akihabara in 2010.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So your father’s real!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Of course he is! At this age, he’s probably still young and cool.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“His name was Barrel Titor, right?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yeah, that’s right.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow, a foreigner?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No, I’m pretty sure he’s Japanese. Barrel Titor is his codename in the Resistance. I don’t think he’s using it yet.”[%p]
So that’s why Suzuha called herself “John Titor.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I... don’t know his real name.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Some daughter, huh?”[%p]
Suzuha looks like she’s about to cry for an instant, but she quickly covers it with a bitter smile.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“He died before he could tell me.”[%p]
Hearing that, I realize how hellish the world she came from must be.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What about your surname, Amane?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That was my mother’s maiden name.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So you have no leads?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Leads... oh, there is one thing.”[%p]
Suzuha claps her hands together and starts patting her pockets. A few seconds later, she reaches into one and pulls out...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“A pin?”[%p]
I’ve seen Suzuha fiddling with it before.[%p]
It’s just a regular pin, the kind you stick on your hat or bag.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“There’s something written on it.”[%p]
It reads “OSHM***A 7010”.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“This belonged to my dad.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“A memento...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Google it, Daru!”[%p]
Daru runs a search, but gets only incomprehensible foreign sites.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“He was here in Akihabara, so I think we can exclude the foreign sites.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okay, got it.”[%p]
He narrows the search down to Japanese sites.[%p]
But even then, none of the results look relevant.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nothing!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But this has to be some kind of hint!”[%p]
With Suzuha’s permission, I take a picture of the pin.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay, all in favor of helping Suzu-san find her dad?”[%p]
I want to argue that there’s no time for that, but Mayuri’s right when she says that the time machine won’t be ready for a while. I guess there’s no harm in letting her have her way.[%p]
After all, there’s no point in running, not even with two days’ head start. Even if I dragged Mayuri to the ends of the Earth, we wouldn’t be able to escape her death. I know that now.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...No objections.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Thanks, Okarin♪ Ehehe!”[%p]
Daru raises his hand in agreement.[%p]
So does Kurisu.[%p]
It’s decided. We’ll help Suzuha find her father.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Everyone... thank you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But I want to be clear that my mission to 1975 comes first. That was my dad’s final wish, after all.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So if we still haven’t found him by the time repairs are complete, I think we should give up. Is that okay?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Are you sure?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If we still haven’t found him by then, it just wasn’t meant to be.”[%p]
It’s a relief to hear Suzuha say that.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So where do we start?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The pin is our only hint. We’ll hit every store in Akiba that sells things like this. Maybe someone will know where it came from.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What kind of stores?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Akiba is full of niche stores where you can find strange and cool accessories.”[%p]
It’s hard to sneak into Radi-Kan in the daytime.[%p]
There isn’t a crowd out front like before, but pedestrian traffic remains constant.[%p]
It takes us about 30 minutes to find a way in.[%p]
Kurisu is back at the lab, working on the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
It needs to be complete by 2 PM on the 13th. If she’s late, it could affect my ability to time leap, which would lower my chances of saving Mayuri.[%p]
Speaking of Mayuri, she wandered off somewhere in search of Suzuha’s father.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How does it look?”[%p]
I call to Daru, who’s examining the flooded satellite -- I mean, time machine -- while Suzuha and I keep a lookout.[%p]
Daru crawls out of the machine. He’s covered in sweat, and his breathing is heavy.[%p]
We quickly help pull his huge body out.[%p]
The time machine is completely visible from the street.[%p]
If someone were to see us up here, they might report us to the police.[%p]
It’s been two weeks since the satellite appeared, but Akiba still has tourists who come just to see it. We need to take care not to be noticed.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s so freaking hot in there.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s worse than a sauna. Spend too much time in there and I’ll turn into Daru jerky.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“By the way, it’s not gonna fall or anything... right?”[%p]
The time machine is balanced precariously on the ledge, but the police have hooked up support wires, so Daru probably has nothing to worry about.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Can it be fixed?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, I still don’t know for sure. But there is one thing I noticed just now.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s built kind of like the PhoneWave.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That means there’s a chance, right!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I said I’m not sure. I need to poke around some more.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru. Super Hacka. Everything depends on your skills now.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You are the super hacka who will save the world. In 2036, people will worship you instead of Kurisu, the mother of the time machine.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s hacker! How many times do I have to tell you!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, you have two days. Do whatever it takes, Daru.”[%p]
I place my hand on Daru’s shoulder and look straight into his eyes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re our only hope.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“No promises, man. And why two days?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well...”[%p]
Because that’s when Mayuri will die. But I can’t say that.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“In two days, the weather conditions will be perfect for creating the ring singularity.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If we miss that window, we won’t have another chance until next year.”[%p]
Nice excuse, Suzuha![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“P-precisely!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Fix it in two days? That’s just nuts.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But if you do, you’ll earn the right to a date with Faris.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you fix it?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“No problem!”[%p]
Great. Now I just need to figure out how I’m going to convince Faris...[%p]
“OSHM***A 7010”[%p]
We’re searching for something with the same cryptic logo as this mysterious pin.[%p]
Honestly, I didn’t think it would be this difficult.[%p]
Akiba has plenty of niche stores, but they’re all for electronic goods and PC parts. There aren’t that many selling accessories like Suzuha’s pin.[%p]
We check every one we can find, but come up empty-handed. None of the store employees have any idea where it came from either.[%p]
We even check nearby neighborhoods like Ueno and Asakusa. Nothing.[%p]
Suzuha and I return to the lab with heavy hearts.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Welcome back.”[%p]
Kurisu emerges from the development room to greet us. She’s alone.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“From the looks on your faces, I guess you didn’t find anything.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where’s Daru?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“He hasn’t come back yet. It’s already dark, so maybe he went straight home?”[%p]
It’s too dark to work at Radi-Kan now.[%p]
We can’t use lights, because that would be too conspicuous to the people below. [%p]
Mayuri isn’t around. Is she making any progress in the search for Suzuha’s father?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I feel bad. There’s no time for this...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not for you. We’re doing it to save Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Yeah.”[%p]
I start up Daru’s computer and search the net for communities of people who collect unique pins.[%p]
I’ll investigate tomorrow based on the information I find.[%p]
There’s a pin collecting group on a site called FrePara, where everyone shows off their collections. I post there, asking for information.[%p]
I’m sleeping on the couch when a loud alarm rings in my ears.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is it SERN!?”[%p]
I jump up and see Kurisu and Suzuha.[%p]
Kurisu is holding her phone. That’s the source of the sound.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Good morning.”[%p]
Her sour expression says it’s not good at all.[%p]
I wish she’d put herself in my shoes and see what it’s like to be woken up suddenly like that.[%p]
I check the time on my phone.[%p]
It’s just before 7 AM.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...You came to wake me up? Thanks.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I didn’t do it for you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I asked her to wake you up, Okabe Rintaro. There’s something I want to show you.”[%p]
I realize that there’s a strange object sitting on the table in front of me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What’s this?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“A divergence meter. The numbers indicate the divergence value of the current worldline.”[%p]
The meter displays “0.337187%”.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Divergence is measured from my original worldline, which corresponds to zero.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You made this?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No. I brought it with me from 2036.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“These are Nixie tubes, right? Whoever made this has taste. I’d happily dub it Future Gadget No. 9.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“How exactly does it work? It shouldn’t be possible to measure changes like that.”[%p]
Suzuha shrugs.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I don’t know either.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You don’t know!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Can you guess who made it?”[%p]
How should I know?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You did, Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You made it, umm... 11 years from now. It apparently works the same way your special power does.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So this meter lets other people check worldline divergence?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I wish.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m pretty sure only Okabe Rintaro would notice if the number changed.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What? Then there’s no point. Make something useful for once, Okabe.”[%p]
I ignore Kurisu’s complaints and look at the meter again.[%p]
This is something I made.[%p]
Fifteen years have passed since I completed it.[%p]
Eleven years will pass before I complete it.[%p]
It’s a strange feeling.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Only the person who made it knows how it works. Wait 11 years. I’m sure he’ll have figured it out by then.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you met me in the future?”[%p]
She did say I was an infamous terrorist in 2036.[%p]
For some reason, Suzuha’s expression darkens momentarily.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...No. Never.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, why are you showing me this?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“When the meter reads over 1%, you’ve made it to the Beta worldline.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“1%...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Right. Reach 1% divergence... and you’ll save Shiina Mayuri.”[%p]
I stare at the glowing red numbers. They don’t budge.[%p]
Just another 0.6%... it seems so easy.[%p]
But there are six digits after the decimal point, and no tens place. What does that mean?[%p]
Something tells me it won’t be as easy as it looks.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You can have it. No point in me carrying it around. I hope you’ll find a use for it.”[%p]
