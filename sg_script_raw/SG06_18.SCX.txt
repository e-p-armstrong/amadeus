Based on recommendations from the BBS thread, I spend the morning visiting stores in Akiba.[%p]
My destinations run the gamut from otaku stores packed with anime goods to souvenir shops full of Olympic memorabilia. I even visit a few that specialize in locally-manufactured goods.[%p]
But although I hit just about every kind of store that could be considered niche, I am unable to find anything that resembles Suzuha’s pin.[%p]
Maybe I should go all the way to Ikebukuro or Nakano.[%p]
I start heading back to the lab, but just then, a street vendor catches my eye.[%p]
The storekeeper is a foreigner covered in tattoos. The table next to him is covered with accessories and other fashion items.[%p]
This is the first time I’ve seen such a stylish street stand in Akiba. Most vendors just sell random junk.[%p]
It’s not like I have anything to lose, so I walk over and check out the selection. Among the various accessories, I see a number of metal pins.[%p]
What a coincidence. Could he have a pin like Suzuha’s?[%p]
I don’t see the “OSHM***A 7010” logo on any of the displayed accessories, but I’d better ask just to be sure.[%p]
Umm... he’s a foreigner... so maybe I should use English?[%p]
Our eyes meet. His are as bright and blue as the sky.[%p]
I quickly look away.[%p]
Damn! He must think I’m a coward.[%p]
Better get this over with.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“HEY, MASTER. I AM MAD SCIENTIST. SO COOOOL. SONUVABITCH!”[%p]
[name]Master[line]“Can I help you?”[%p]
He smiles a wide, toothy smile -- nice teeth -- and answers in Japanese.[%p]
I was hoping for more of a reaction...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Um, I have a question, if you don’t mind.”[%p]
I take the photocopy of Suzuha’s pin out of my pocket.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Does this look familiar?”[%p]
The man stares at it for a while, then shrugs and shakes his head in the exaggerated manner typical of westerners.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I want to know where it came from. Can you help me find out?”[%p]
[name]Master[line]“Ee... remember... remember? Hmmm, sorry, itsa little diff-cult, eh...”[%p]
What is he saying?[%p]
[name]Master[line]“By the way, where’d ya get this thang?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s what I want to know. I’ll compensate you.”[%p]
[name]Master[line]“I sorry.”[%p]
He apologizes in broken Japanese.[%p]
It looks like this is another dead end.[%p]
Just in case, I give him my contact information and ask him to get in touch if he finds out anything. Then I turn to leave.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
Suzuha’s standing a short distance away.[%p]
She’s holding a drink. It’s my favorite, Dr P -- no, wait, that’s cola.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“’Sup. Want a drink?”[%p]
I accept the offer, and quench my thirst while leaning on the roadside fence.[%p]
Last time I saw her, Suzuha was on her way to Kanda to continue the search. How long has she been standing here?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anything?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Nope.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So what was with your English back there?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It sounded dumb. ’So cooool.’”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Is that standard English in this era?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course not.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, so it’s an Okabe Rintaro original. There’s no overseas travel in my time, so I wouldn’t know.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No overseas travel? What, you mean at all?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Pretty much. Travel permits are hard to get, and they’d never issue one for a vacation. I’d never seen a foreigner before coming to this time.”[%p]
So in the future, no one is allowed to leave Japan?[%p]
Japan was like that a few centuries ago too, when the Tokugawa shogunate closed the country to the west.[%p]
It sounds like SERN set international relations back hundreds of years.[%p]
Perhaps that’s why there’s no war in Suzuha’s time. It’s hard for conflicts to emerge when races and cultures can’t interact.[%p]
It sounds kind of like a prison with invisible walls, guarded by SERN and the Committee of 300.[%p]
I mean, ending war is obviously a good thing, but...[%p]
Anyway, there’s no point thinking about the distant future now. We need to come up with a new plan.[%p]
The sunlight beats on my head, making it hard to think.[%p]
I feel like I’m standing in a sauna.[%p]
Why does the sun hate me so much?[%p]
Shining in the center of the sky like he owns the damn place...[%p]
Dammit! Why can’t we find any information on that pin?[%p]
I suppose it’s no skin off my back if we don’t find Suzuha’s father.[%p]
As long as Daru fixes the time machine, nothing else matters.[%p]
So why do I feel so bad about my lack of progress? I really don’t know.[%p]
Maybe I’m just frustrated by my own powerlessness.[%p]
I can’t save Mayuri.[%p]
I can’t fix Suzuha’s time machine.[%p]
I can’t even help Kurisu with the Time Leap upgrade.[%p]
So what am I good for?[%p]
The only thing I can do is help Suzuha find her father.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Maybe this pin is newer than we think. I mean, maybe it hasn’t been made yet.”[%p]
Suzuha stretches, then looks at me with a calm smile.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Maybe I’m not meant to meet him. I mean, we’ve tried everything and still no sign. It’s just not in the cards, I guess.”[%p]
I feel a surge of anger at her words.[%p]
Here I am stewing in self-loathing, and she acts like it doesn’t matter!?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How can you give up? We still have one more day!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“W-why are you getting mad?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Everyone’s fighting for [color index="A0140000"]you[color index="800000"]. Don’t you get it!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Me? I want to prioritize Mayuri over everything else!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But you’re still a lab mem, a friend! When a friend’s in trouble, you want to help them. That’s how Mayuri felt, and I agree. That’s why I’m searching!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So how dare you be the first to give up!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Y-you don’t have to yell!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t disappoint me like this!”[%p]
I tell myself to calm down. This is just my own feelings of impotence boiling over.[%p]
There’s no time for this.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m sorry. But maybe you should think about how I feel.”[%p]
I realize that we have an audience. Some pedestrians are grinning at us, like they think we’re a bickering couple or something.[%p]
I take a deep breath.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...You’re right. I shouldn’t have said that.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
It’s too awkward to make eye contact.[%p]
So I look around, pretending to think.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Alright. What next?”[%p]
I wonder how the other lab mems are progressing.[%p]
I’m especially concerned about Daru.[%p]
Depending on the situation, he might need some relief.[%p]
He’s been working in that heat for hours, so we should bring him something cold to drink.[%p]
And then there’s Mayuri.[%p]
She’s been working alone, trying to find some information on Suzuha’s father.[%p]
If I close my eyes, I can still recall her death -- deaths -- in every detail. I resist the urge to pound my head against the wall.[%p]
Although we still have over 24 hours before that happens, I can’t help but worry about leaving her alone.[%p]
But currently, all I can do is search for that pin.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Tutturu♪ Mayushii here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where are you now?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Umm, in front of the station.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s meet up. Stay right there.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okay!”[%p]
Suzuha and I head to the station.[%p]
When we get there, I hear Mayuri’s voice.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Please take one! We need your help!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What is she doing?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“There’s been a kidnapping! The kidnapper was wearing this pin! Please help us find him!”[%p]
Why is Mayuri passing out leaflets?[%p]
When I call out to her, Mayuri smiles and wipes the sweat off her brow with a handkerchief.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin, Suzu-san! Um, there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask.”[%p]
Yeah?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The ’Barrel’ in Suzuha’s dad’s name. What does it mean?”[%p]
Uh...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s just a name. It probably doesn’t mean anything.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But it’s not his real name, right?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Right. It’s a codename.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So why did he choose Barrel Titor? And why did you choose John, Suzu-san?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Because John’s the most common English name.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But Barrel isn’t common.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Now that you mention it.”[%p]
So she’s saying there must be a meaning behind the codename?[%p]
Is that what her leaflets are about? I take a look.[%p]
...Oh.[%p]
“Bring a kidnaper (sic) to justice! The evildoer wears this pin! He could be your neighbor! He could be standing next to you right now!”[%p]
“If you have any information, please contact the email address below!”[%p]
It’s all written in colored marker with cute drawings and a photo of Suzuha’s pin attached.[%p]
I’ve gotta say... Mayuri’s childish handwriting really brings it all together.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Well, whatcha think? I think it’s a masterpiece!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s this kidnapping stuff about?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It was my idea. I’m sure it’ll make everyone want to help!”[%p]
Mayuri grins triumphantly.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s a good strategy, dontcha think? Umm, the operation name is ’Mayushii’s Awesome Leaflet Plan’.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Um... isn’t this going a little too far?”[%p]
Yeah, what happens if the police hear about--[%p]
[name]???[line]“You three.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“!?”[%p]
My heart freezes as if sprayed with liquid nitrogen.[%p]
I slowly turn around...[%p]
A stern-faced policeman is standing there with crossed arms.[%p]
Speak of the devil![%p]
[name]Policeman[line]“What are these leaflets about? Let’s talk at the station.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehh?”[%p]
I consider making a run for it, but that will just make things worse. I grab Suzuha’s arm before she can do anything rash.[%p]
Better just to bite the bullet and go along.[%p]
After about an hour of interrogation, they release us without charges.[%p]
Kurisu greets the three of us when we return to the lab dead tired.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, Okabe, remember the lifter? I don’t suppose you’ve figured out what it is... no, of course you haven’t.”[%p]
Oh, right. We hadn’t discovered the lifter at this point in time.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I already know. It’s the 42-inch CRT downstairs.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“R-really? What’s your proof?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve been here before, remember?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Oh, right. The CRT... I see...”[%p]
Kurisu heads back into the development room, nodding to herself.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m sorry, guys. I made things worse...”[%p]
I give Mayuri some chicken to cheer her up.[%p]
There’s not much time left.[%p]
What else can we do before the time limit?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Hello.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Assistant? It’s me.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Oh, I think you got the wrong number.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you saying? It’s me, Hououin Kyouma.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“My name isn’t Assistant. And your name isn’t Hououin Kyouma.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Would you prefer to be called ’KuriGohan and Kamehameha’?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Bwah!?”[%p]
I hear rattling from the other side of the phone.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“How do you know about that!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Before I time leaped, you made a tearful confession. You said, ’I’m an @channeler, a [color index="820000"]Nicojunkie[color index="800000"], and a camwhore who posts tits, but will you still accept me as your assistant?’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And I, of course, replied...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“’You may be an @channeler, a Nicojunkie, and a camwhore who posts tits, but you’re still a member of this lab.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And that makes you my assistant, now and forever. So wipe your tears, for there is still much--’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“I’m gonna post your personal info all over VIP if you don’t shut your mouth right this second!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...How are things there?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Fine. You called at the right time. We need to talk.”[%p]
Just like that, we’re back to normal conversation.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll be right there.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“OK. I’ll be waiting.”[%p]
I take Suzuha back to the lab.[%p]
Kurisu greets us with a cold stare when we return to the lab.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“For your information, I don’t post t...ti...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t post pictures of my chest, okay!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It was just a joke. Let it die.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Kurigohan and Kamehameha... so you’re the one who kept picking fights with me on the internet. Makes sense.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I thought you wanted an open discussion.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Sure. You were kind of annoying, though.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hehehe...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ahaha!”[%p]
Are these two still fighting?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By the way, it may shock you to learn that I am the poster known as Hououin Kyou--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu & Suzuha[line][center]”I know.”[%p]
Gh, the same reaction again![%p]
Why do they only agree when it’s at my expense!?[%p]
I clear my throat and change the subject.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, what did you want to talk about? The Time Leap Machine?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I think you probably forgot, so I wanted to make sure just in case.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Have you been looking for the lifter? You haven’t, have you?”[%p]
Oh, right. We hadn’t discovered what it was at this point in time.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I already know. It’s the 42-inch CRT downstairs.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“R-really? What’s your proof?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve been here before, remember?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I see...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Sorry for sticking you with this job.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What? Don’t apologize. It’s creepy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know you’re not a fan of time travel research. But here you are building a time machine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I was just worried that maybe you were feeling conflicted.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“How rude.”[%p]
Kurisu’s scowls.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m sure I’ve said this before, but I’ve always accepted time travel as a theory.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I just don’t trust people who claim it can be done despite how unrealistic it is.”[%p]
She sighs, then looks me over from head to toe.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Besides, I can hardly deny it with evidence staring me in the face.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Though I still don’t like the idea of being called the mother of the time machine.”[%p]
Suzuha shrugs at this.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway. If you’re apologizing, that must mean you helped out the first time.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The first time?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Before you started time leaping. You helped me build the machine, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. Daru and I helped.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then don’t worry about it. I wouldn’t want you to have to do it all over again.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And right now, it’s more important to repair Amane-san’s time machine and search for her father.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Sorry.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t you apologize now. It’s weird.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Welp, back to work. I should be able to get a lot done now that I know about the lifter.”[%p]
Kurisu waves and vanishes into the development room.[%p]
I’d better not disturb her.[%p]
The time limit is approaching.[%p]
What else can I do?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Hoihoi.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. Report.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“You know, it’s distracting as hell when you talk like that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Enough about you. Report the status of the repairs.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“I’m turning into a prune here!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Hey, at least give me some reaction.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Anyway, I think I figured out what it needs.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Really!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Pretty much.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Should I bring reinforcements?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Mm, yeah, I guess. Bring Amane-shi with you if you can.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Alone in the heat of the vacant Radi-Kan rooftop, the two of us can forget our shame and take off our clothes. Haah haah...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I hope we find your dried-up bones.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Gonna have to disappoint you there. How about you? Did you find out anything about the pin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No. It’s an uphill battle.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Not even a clue?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Damn, that sucks.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m going to hit up a few more places. I’ll head over there in the evening.”[%p]
That gives me two more hours today to search for the pin. If that fails, tomorrow morning will be our last chance.[%p]
These two extra days have gone by faster than expected.[%p]
We decide to try Ikebukuro as our last stop for today.[%p]
It would be nice to visit home, but I don’t have the time, and besides, Suzuha’s with me.[%p]
...Our search turns up nothing.[%p]
As the evening wears on without a single lead, Suzuha and I grow quieter and quieter.[%p]
We’re exhausted from walking, and we can’t shake the feeling that all our efforts are futile.[%p]
This isn’t good.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By the way...”[%p]
I try stirring up conversation.[%p]
I should get her to talk about the future.[%p]
After all, she is a time traveler. This is a once in a lifetime chance.[%p]
I remember how shocked Kurisu was to learn that she only lives to be 44.[%p]
And I was told... that I become a terrorist.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Am I really famous in 2036?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“As a terrorist.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So what did I do to be called a terrorist?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You rebelled against SERN. You’re actually one of the founding members of the Resistance. Just like my dad.”[%p]
I help found the Resistance...[%p]
I guess it makes sense, given what we’re going through now.[%p]
Suzuha is from the future of this timeline, where Mayuri is doomed to die, and where SERN forces Kurisu to build a time machine.[%p]
In such a future, how could I not rebel against SERN?[%p]
Rebellion against the system. Destruction of order. A new age of chaos.[%p]
Weren’t those my ambitions as a mad scientist?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How stupid...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Stupid?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How can I still be chasing some chuunibyou fantasy... when I couldn’t even save Mayuri?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’re fighting to free humanity. I think it’s a noble cause.”[%p]
Suzuha is part of the Resistance I form. Does that mean she’s my subordinate in the future?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What sort of man am I?”[%p]
Suzuha’s expression darkens.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...I said we never met, remember?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Never?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Never. You were... killed by SERN. In 2025.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I was killed... by the same people who killed Mayuri.[%p]
They had no reservations about murdering an innocent girl. I doubt they would hesitate to kill a terrorist.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Maybe I should have told you sooner.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Understand? If you don’t change the future, you’re going to die in 15 years.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Shiina Mayuri will die. You will die. Makise Kurisu will be a slave to SERN. It ends badly for every lab mem.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What about Daru?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Umm, I don’t remember hearing about him. I have heard legends of a ’wizard-class hacker,’ though.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Though I don’t understand what ’wizard-class’ means in the first place.”[%p]
Wizard-class. I coined that term.[%p]
I can imagine Daru slowly insinuating himself into every corner of the internet, until he becomes a godlike virtual presence that not even SERN can comprehend.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Anyway, I don’t want that to happen to you guys.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s one more reason I need to find an IBN 5100 and change the future.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Until I came to this time, you guys were just stories, history. But now... you’re my friends.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I want to save you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Appreciated.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You are a lab mem, now and forevermore.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ahaha! Thanks.”[%p]
I already told Kurisu that I was confident in her ability to complete the machine on time.[%p]
But it occurs to me that I forgot to tell her about the 42-inch CRT.[%p]
There, that should do it.[%p]
I send a reply and decide to keep searching for the pin with Suzuha just a bit longer.[%p]
Time is quickly running out.[%p]
Is there anything more that we can do?[%p]
