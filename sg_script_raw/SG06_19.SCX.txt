It’s early evening, but the roof of Radi-Kan is still hotter than hell.[%p]
When I provide Daru with the refreshing gift of Dr P, a frown appears on his sweaty face.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’re supposed to give me an ice cold zero calorie cola. Common sense, man...”[%p]
I forgot he’s a cola guy.[%p]
No sense letting it go to waste. I drink the Dr P myself.[%p]
Daru and Suzuha start discussing the time machine. Mayuri and I watch from a short distance away.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, Okarin. Isn’t it amazing that the satellite was a time machine?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, I guess so.”[%p]
I thought that Titor’s time machine was a car -- a 1970s Chevy. It never even occurred to me to suspect the satellite.[%p]
I should know better than to take anything for granted.[%p]
In retrospect, the satellite was suspicious from the start. Not only had it appeared out of nowhere, but Titor only starting posting afterwards. [%p]
I’m disappointed in myself for not realizing the connection.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m glad Suzu-san wasn’t hurt in the crash.”[%p]
I doubt it was anything like a crash.[%p]
It probably just appeared there, displacing the wall, which then collapsed around it.[%p]
After all, the time machine isn’t self-propelled. It doesn’t fly.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I heard it’s really hard to drive.”[%p]
I guess she heard that from Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“If the gravitational whatchamacallit coordinates are just a teensy bit off, the whole time machine becomes a jellyman and goes ploop.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And she even said her time machine’s unstable, since it’s not a SERN model.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m worried about her trip to 1975...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Do you think I should go with her? I wonder if I’d fit.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What would you do in 1975?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’d cheer Suzu-san on, of course! I’d hold her hand super tight, and tell her that everything’s going to be okay!”[%p]
Something tells me that won’t be much help.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, Okarin, do you think the time machine has a name?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A name...”[%p]
That’s the least of what I want to know about the time machine.[%p]
Time permitting, I’d like to spend a whole day picking Suzuha’s brain.[%p]
I’m pretty sure John Titor’s time machine had a model number.[%p]
But the John Titor from 2000 might not have been Suzuha.[%p]
There was no John Titor in 2000 on this worldline, after all.[%p]
Although... I suppose it’s possible that Suzuha will drop by 2000 after traveling to 1975.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you want to know, just ask Titor.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, yeah! Mayushii didn’t think of that. Ehehe!”[%p]
Mayuri giggles, then runs off to talk to Suzuha.[%p]
She comes back quickly.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup. It has a name.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What is it?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“FG204 something something, she said.”[%p]
Something something?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Anyway, don’t you think Daru-kun and Suzu-san are a good match?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Mayuri’s jumping all over the place today.[%p]
I look at Daru and Suzuha again.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How do you figure? Daru’s all about Faris, you know.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh... really?”[%p]
She tilts her head to the side.[%p]
Good grief...[%p]
Mayuri and I aren’t of any use. I would prefer to leave Daru and Suzuha to it and resume the search for Suzuha’s father, but Mayuri seems happy just sitting here.[%p]
We don’t have any leads on the pin or its owner.[%p]
Maybe two days just aren’t enough.[%p]
No, that’s quitter’s talk. Like I told Suzuha, I don’t want to give up.[%p]
Besides, even if we don’t get the information we need this time, I can use the Time Leap Machine to repeat these two days until we do.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh yeah, Mayuri. What happened to your costumes?”[%p]
There’s only a few more days until ComiMa. I remember Mayuri pulling all-nighters to get her costume done. Has that changed?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hm? I already made two costumes. One for Kaede-chan and one for Fubuki-chan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Weren’t you making a third one for Lukako?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah, I was. But I couldn’t convince her, so I gave up this time.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, can Mayushii take a closer look at the time machine?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just don’t get in their way.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okeydokey♪”[%p]
Mayuri beams happily, then runs over to the time machine.[%p]
She’s acting like this is a field trip...[%p]
Behind her, the sun glows dark and orange on the horizon. It’s quite a view from up here.[%p]
After a few minutes watching the sunset in silence, I realize that Suzuha is standing beside me. She must have come over as Mayuri left. Our shadows are long and murky.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hashida Itaru’s amazing. He said if things go well, he could have the time machine fixed by tomorrow.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“He’s a man who gets things done.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And he looks so unhealthy and slow.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t judge a book by its cover.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yeah. I have a better impression of him now.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Umm... hey.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“There’s something I want to say, and I feel like I’ll never get another chance.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why so melodramatic?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m really grateful to you. All of you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“When I came to this time, I didn’t know anyone. I was all alone in a world completely different from my own.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“This era is so peaceful. That’s a wonderful thing... but it scared me. All I knew was the fight against SERN.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But now I have friends... real friends, who I can share my secrets with.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“All these people who lived before I was born are working so hard for my sake.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s a strange feeling... but a happy one, too.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I wanted you to know that.”[%p]
Suzuha’s tone is wistful. Why?[%p]
I try to speak, but she continues before I can.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Living with you guys in this time... it’s been really fun.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“When I met you, you were all so strange and unique and over the top... I was kind of shocked at first, actually.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But before I knew it, I started to enjoy spending time with you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“2036 is peaceful too. People don’t even fight anymore. Did you know that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How could I? I’m not even alive in 2036, right?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh... right. Sorry.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Anyway, people don’t fight. Ever. About anything. All forms of conflict, war included, have vanished -- poof -- without a trace.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Instead, everyone has dead eyes, like fish.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No one has ambition. Nobody dreams. They just trudge through their lives without a single complaint.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh sure, people smile. But they never get angry or sad.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“There’s no individuality. Everyone’s a robot.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You got really mad at me before, remember?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I was really surprised. But at the same time... I was really happy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re a strange girl.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ahaha. I guess so.”[%p]
Suzuha looks at the time machine. Daru and Mayuri are standing next to it, talking cheerfully about something or another.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’re all so bright and full of life. I envy you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Shiina Mayuri, Hashida Itaru... even Makise Kurisu. And of course, you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Don’t be ridiculous.”[%p]
There’s nothing enviable about me.[%p]
I’m worthless. I can’t even save Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I want to be more like you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you ask me, you’re the amazing one.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m... happy to hear you say that.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s thanks to all of you that I’m still going strong.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Being a lab mem, even for just a little while... was great.”[%p]
She smiles then -- a soft, sad smile that tears at my heart.[%p]
What does it mean?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Being with you guys, even for just a little while... was great.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Suzuha?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Change the future, Okabe Rintaro. Make it a world like this one, where people can be free.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, come on. Why are you being so sentimental?”[%p]
Does she not want to go to 1975?[%p]
But I mean, she’s got a time machine, so can’t she just come back afterwards?[%p]
Even as I think it, I realize how wrong I am.[%p]
...Of course.[%p]
When Suzuha completes her mission and brings us the IBN 5100, the worldline will change.[%p]
The future will be rewritten, and the 2036 she knows will cease to exist.[%p]
To hear her describe it, the future is an awful place. But even so, it was her home.[%p]
She has friends there, I’m sure, comrades-in-arms, and memories of her father, Barrel Titor.[%p]
All of that will be lost to her forever.[%p]
No wonder she’s getting sentimental.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“After we fix the time machine, let’s have a party.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Thanks.”[%p]
And yet, she’s still smiling that sorrowful smile.[%p]
