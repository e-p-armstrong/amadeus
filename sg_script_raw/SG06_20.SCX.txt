Afterwards, I hit the streets again in search of the pin.[%p]
But the day ended without a single lead, so I reluctantly returned to the lab and tried searching the internet.[%p]
A couple of hours later, and still no luck.[%p]
So far, I’ve accomplished absolutely nothing. My frustration is mounting.[%p]
I can time leap again, but will that really help us find Suzuha’s father?[%p]
An unfamiliar number.[%p]
Who is it?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me.”[%p]
[name]???[line][color index="8A0000"]“Hi, Mistah Okabe Rintaro?”[%p]
The voice is heavily accented. I can barely make it out.[%p]
Who is this guy?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“SERN!?”[%p]
I jump to my feet and scan the room, then run to the window and check the road below.[%p]
No suspicious figures in sight.[%p]
Kurisu comes out of the development room and gives me a questioning look, but I wave her back inside.[%p]
[name]???[line][color index="8A0000"]“SERN? What is dat?”[%p]
I gulp and carefully choose my words.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Identify yourself.”[%p]
[name]???[line][color index="8A0000"]“You, one more afternoon, came to our factory make inquiry and told me your telephone number you know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you saying?”[%p]
No, wait.[%p]
I’ve heard this broken Japanese before.[%p]
The strange Japanese filters through my brain, connecting synapses.[%p]
That’s right! It’s that foreign street vendor I met this afternoon in Akiba![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Identified. NICE TO MEET YOU.”[%p]
[name]Master[line][color index="8A0000"]“Oh! You’re welcome.”[%p]
[name]Master[line][color index="8A0000"]“I do custom work. Yesterday night, a guest come here I remembered!”[%p]
[name]Master[line][color index="8A0000"]“That guest was please make pin badge same one you had!”[%p]
I don’t quite get what he’s saying, but he seems really excited about it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll head there right now!”[%p]
I go to the same spot as before. Although his stand has already closed, the westerner is waiting for me.[%p]
[name]Master[line]“Oh! Okaabee! Hello!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where did that guest of yours go!?”[%p]
[name]Master[line]“Client come here was yesterday time.”[%p]
The blue-eyed white man shrugs his shoulders.[%p]
So it was yesterday...[%p]
He contacted me because he remembered.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s his contact info? His name and address!?”[%p]
[name]Master[line]“Poison. Guest just for simulation. Private information have nothing.”[%p]
Uh...[%p]
So last night, someone came by wanting to make metal pins with the same design as Suzuha’s.[%p]
But he died of poisoning?[%p]
Er, the guest was just a simulation, so there’s no private information?[%p]
I’m not following...[%p]
[name]Master[line]“Japanese, very studious and awarding private information, become nervous and serious, yes?”[%p]
That doesn’t help...[%p]
[name]Master[line]“If guest had gave name or telephone number however, no leak. That is business.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Fatigue suddenly weighs down my shoulders.[%p]
I don’t understand a word he’s saying anymore.[%p]
My head is full of question marks.[%p]
In hindsight, I should have brought Kurisu to speak English for me.[%p]
I guess I’ll just have to wing it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What did your customer look like? Man? Woman?”[%p]
[name]Master[line]“Well... So young. Or so middle. Japanese have young face. Just by look no understand.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anything else?”[%p]
[name]Master[line]“Um?”[%p]
[name]Master[line]“Maybe a judo fighter? Or, pro wrestler?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? Judo? Pro wrestler? What do you mean by that?”[%p]
[name]Master[line]“YES!”[%p]
That wasn’t a yes/no question. What the hell do you mean!?[%p]
[name]Master[line]“Ahh, balloon. Was balloon!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Balloon? Judo? Pro wrestling?”[%p]
[name]Master[line]“Good!”[%p]
No! Not good![%p]
Are you trying to confuse me!?[%p]
I want to ask more questions, but the foreigner suddenly sees a policeman walking by and runs off.[%p]
I consider chasing him, but decide against it to avoid police attention.[%p]
I give up...[%p]
The search has hit a dead end, and we have barely any time left to find Barrel Titor.[%p]
I can time leap again starting at 2 PM tomorrow.[%p]
Looks like all I can do is wait until Christina’s done working, and then leap to the time this suspicious character appears at the stand.[%p]
Kurisu carefully connects the two cords she’s holding.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Done.”[%p]
The Time Leap Machine is complete.[%p]
It’s 2:30 PM on the 13th, about 20 minutes later than before.[%p]
Kurisu walks into the lounge with a satisfied look on her face.[%p]
It’s just her, me, and Suzuha in the lab. I had Daru and Mayuri head to Radi-Kan, ostensibly to work on the time machine.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So that’s the Time Leap Machine...”[%p]
Suzuha gazes at the now-complete machine in awe.[%p]
I’ve already explained to her how time leaping works.[%p]
It’s as different as can be from Suzuha’s time machine, which can physically displace actual bodies.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It makes you remember the future, right? That’s pretty interesting.”[%p]
Suzuha crosses her hands behind her head and looks up at the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Intuition... sixth sense... deja vu...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I wonder if those things are actually you recalling future memories.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Some of SERN’s researchers in my time came up with the theory that memories are a way of sharing information across worldlines.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Maybe it’s similar to that.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I just wish we knew more about Okabe’s Reading Steiner thing.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Is it unique to Okabe? Or does everyone have the potential for it, and Okabe’s is just stronger by coincidence?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“One thing’s for certain. My consciousness leaps to the past along with my memories.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I still don’t understand why that is. It would make more sense if you experienced a change in the present, like you do when we send a D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Does your consciousness depend on your memories?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The problem is that consciousness doesn’t have a form that we can see.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Same goes for the soul. Those things are still in the realm of religion.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Even in 2036, the existence of the soul hasn’t been proven, and nobody’s proven what forms consciousness, either.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I see... that’s a little disappointing.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sending my consciousness back has let me change some future events with more precision than D-Mail, but other events are locked in by convergence.”[%p]
I can change the method of Mayuri’s death, but never the fact that she dies.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s not how it works.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The future is always determined.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then why does the path there change?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Because the worldline changes.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“When you leap into the past and take different actions from before, divergence changes, if only a little bit.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“In most cases, that fluctuation won’t amount to more than 0.000001% on the divergence meter.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Small changes might not register at all.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“When you change the cause, the effect merely shifts to a separate, already-existing worldline.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Since those two worldlines are almost exactly the same, you barely feel any difference.”[%p]
So is that why Reading Steiner didn’t react?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s not like the previous worldline disappears. It keeps existing as another possible worldline.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s the many-worlds interpretation, right?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“In any case, they’re not parallel worlds.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So is the future reconstructed?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I guess you could say that.”[%p]
I’m confused again. Maybe it’s impossible for me to fully understand the structure of the universe.[%p]
Anyway, that’s enough discussion.[%p]
It’s time for me to leap again.[%p]
I explain the situation to Kurisu and have her activate the Time Leap Machine immediately.[%p]
It’s the night of the 11th. I went back about 40 hours.[%p]
My objective is to keep watch on the street vendor’s stand in the hope that Suzuha’s father might appear.[%p]
I sent Suzuha elsewhere. I don’t want her to be disappointed if I come up empty-handed.[%p]
I’m standing out of sight a short distance away from the stand, munching on energy bars and soy milk to appease my growling stomach.[%p]
I’ve already been here for two hours.[%p]
I forgot to ask for the exact time the suspicious character appeared, so I had to begin my stakeout before sunset.[%p]
Now it’s 8 PM and the stand looks like it’s about to close.[%p]
Is this another waste of time?[%p]
Did that foreigner give me false information?[%p]
But just as I’m finishing my milk...[%p]
Someone approaches the stand.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is that...!?”[%p]
I jump out of cover.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin!?”[%p]
Daru jumps in surprise.[%p]
But I’m the one who’s really shocked here.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing here!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I was gonna ask the same question.”[%p]
The storekeeper is looking at us funny, so we decide to change locations.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alright, Daru. What were you doing at that street stand? Don’t tell me you were trying to counterfeit duplicates of Titor’s pin.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...F-fine. I won’t tell you then.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
So that’s what happened.[%p]
Daru was the suspicious character the foreigner told me about.[%p]
So all that stuff about judo, pro wrestling, and balloons was referring to Daru’s size?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Could he have been more confusing!?”[%p]
Damn! It was all for nothing![%p]
Good thing I didn’t bring Suzuha along.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So why were you trying to make counterfeit versions of the pin?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uh, I wasn’t trying to [color index="A0140000"]counterfeit[color index="800000"] it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Close enough.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well... I meant it as a backup plan, I guess.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Amane-shi’s gonna be sad if we don’t find her old man, right?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So if that happens, I’ll show her the badges I made and, well, lie that her dad was here...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So you’ll give her false hope.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You don’t have to put it like that. Remember, there are good lies and bad lies: bad lies hurt people, good lies save them!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What eroge did you get that from?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“CLADDAN... and it’s not an eroge, it’s a visual novel that teaches you the meaning of life, so shut up!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So... should I call off Operation Fake Titor?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you really think that will make Suzuha happy?”[%p]
Daru’s expression suddenly turns sad.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Amane-shi told me not to tell anyone, but...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I guess I’d better tell you.”[%p]
He’s got a big mouth, as usual.[%p]
Still, he seems dead serious, so I’d better hear him out.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I heard this from Amane-shi when we were discussing the repairs.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Her time machine... can only leap to the past.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What?”[%p]
At first, I don’t understand what he means.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nonsense. Titor’s time machine could travel both ways.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Did you actually see it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, no...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Besides, when you say Titor, you mean the one who appeared in 2000, don’t you? I don’t know anything about that Titor.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
That’s right. The Titor I know and Suzuha aren’t necessarily the same person.[%p]
Although their time machines are similar, there are significant differences. For example, one looks like a Chevy, and the other looks like a satellite.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So... wait.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Once she leaves, she can’t come back.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re saying that if she goes to 1975, she can’t return to 2010?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Not without living 35 years in real time.”[%p]
Is he serious?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Does that mean Suzuha’s time machine can never return to 2036?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Didn’t I just say that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then it’s defective!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Right. She said the time machine was incomplete.”[%p]
Incomplete? Incomplete!?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“According to Amane-shi, her old man built it in secret by reverse-engineering SERN technology.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But SERN killed him before he could complete it. Amane-shi insists that it’s fine as long as she can leap to the past, but...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you sure about this?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“She said so herself. I don’t think she was lying.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So if she doesn’t meet her old man before the time machine is repaired...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“She might never get another chance.”[%p]
So that’s why he was trying to make a copy of that pin. As evidence that Suzuha’s father was here.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But making a fake version of her father’s pin isn’t going to solve anything. A lie is a lie.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But if we don’t get caught...”[%p]
I wave Daru silent and massage my temples. Need to think.[%p]
...What difference does it make?[%p]
True, Suzuha might be sad about missing her father, but that’s none of my business. My top priority is Mayuri’s safety.[%p]
That’s right.[%p]
I mustn’t let my emotions control me.[%p]
I need to be more rational, more logical.[%p]
There’s a Japanese proverb: He who pursues two hares will catch neither.[%p]
However...[%p]
That sad smile on Suzuha’s face...[%p]
Now I understand what it meant.[%p]
I feel something tighten deep within my chest.[%p]
