The next day, as night falls, I summon all lab mems except Kurisu to Radi-Kan.[%p]
It’s boiling hot on the rooftop, even in the evening.[%p]
When I provide Daru with the refreshing gift of cola, his sweaty face lightens up.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wow, Okarin! An ice cold zero calorie cola! How thoughtful of you!”[%p]
Daru happily takes the cola and chugs it straight from the bottle.[%p]
Afterwards, Daru and Suzuha start discussing the time machine. Mayuri and I watch from a short distance away.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, Okarin. Isn’t it amazing that the satellite was a time machine?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, I guess so.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m glad Suzu-san wasn’t hurt in the crash.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I heard it’s really hard to drive.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“If the gravitational whatchamacallit coordinates are just a teensy bit off, the whole time machine becomes a jellyman and goes ploop.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And she even said her time machine’s unstable, since it’s not a SERN model.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m worried about her trip to 1975...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Do you think I should go with her? I wonder if I’d fit.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What would you do in 1975?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’d cheer Suzu-san on, of course! I’d hold her hand super tight, and tell her that everything’s going to be okay!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, Okarin, do you think the time machine has a name?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you want to know, just ask Titor.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, yeah! Mayushii didn’t think of that. Ehehe!”[%p]
Mayuri giggles, then runs off to talk to Suzuha. She returns a few seconds later.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup. It has a name.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“FG204 something something, she said.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Anyway, don’t you think Daru-kun and Suzu-san are a good match?”[%p]
I look at Daru and Suzuha again.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru’s all about Faris.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh... really?”[%p]
She tilts her head to the side.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, can Mayushii take a closer look at the time machine?”[%p]
I nod, and Mayuri runs over to the time machine again.[%p]
Behind her, the sun glows dark and orange on the horizon.[%p]
As Mayuri leaves, Suzuha comes over to stand beside me. Our shadows are long and murky in the fading light.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hashida Itaru’s amazing. He said if things go well, he could have the time machine fixed by tomorrow.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And he looks so unhealthy and slow.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
A refreshing breeze blows by.[%p]
It was quite hot a few minutes ago, but the temperature’s finally starting to drop.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Umm... hey.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“There’s something I want to say, and I feel like I’ll never get another chance.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Are you listening?”[%p]
After a moment’s hesitation, I give a little nod.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m really grateful to you. All of you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“When I came to this time, I didn’t know anyone. I was all alone in a world completely different from my own.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“This era is so peaceful. That’s a wonderful thing... but it scared me. All I knew was the fight against SERN.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But now I have friends... real friends, who I can share my secrets with.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“All these people who lived before I was born are working so hard for my sake.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s a strange feeling... but a happy one, too.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I wanted you to know that.”[%p]
I’ve heard these words before. Just like last time, her tone is wistful.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Her time machine can only leap to the past.”[%p]
The truth I heard from Daru plays in my head in an endless refrain.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Living with you guys in this time... it’s been really fun.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“When I met you, you were all so strange and unique and over the top... I was kind of shocked at first, actually.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But before I knew it, I started to enjoy spending time with you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“2036 is peaceful too. People don’t even fight anymore. Did you know that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I shake my head.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Anyway, people don’t fight. Ever. About anything. All forms of conflict, war included, have vanished -- poof -- without a trace.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Instead, everyone has dead eyes, like fish.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No one has ambition. Nobody dreams. They just trudge through their lives without a single complaint.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh sure, people smile. But they never get angry or sad.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“There’s no individuality. Everyone’s a robot.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You got really mad at me before, remember?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I was really surprised. But at the same time... I was really happy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha looks at the time machine. Daru and Mayuri are standing next to it, talking cheerfully about something or another.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’re all so bright and full of life. I envy you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Shiina Mayuri, Hashida Itaru... even Makise Kurisu. And of course, you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I want to be more like you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s thanks to all of you that I’m still going strong.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Being a lab mem, even for just a little while... was great.”[%p]
She smiles then -- a soft, sad smile that tears at my heart.[%p]
This time, I know what that smile means.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Being with you guys, even for just a little while... was great.”[%p]
Suzuha obviously knew from the beginning that if she traveled to 1975, she could never return.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Change the future, Okabe Rintaro. Make it a world like this one, where people can be free.”[%p]
The first time I heard her speak these words, I thought she was sentimental because she couldn’t return to her original 2036.[%p]
I was wrong.[%p]
Forget about 2036. She can’t even return here, to 2010. Not without living 35 years.[%p]
She’ll be 54 when 2010 comes around. The “present” us and the “present” Suzuha can never meet again.[%p]
Suzuha chose this mission.[%p]
To change the future. To save Mayuri.[%p]
Unless Suzuha travels to 1975, Mayuri will die.[%p]
But then, what about Suzuha herself?[%p]
When she leaves for 1975, she’ll have to sacrifice everything she has here.[%p]
How does she feel about that?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hm?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you regret spending time with us?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you regret making new friends here? New memories? Do you wish you had kept your distance?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’ve already abandoned one life. Now you have to abandon another.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In a sense... it’s like you’re killing yourself.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Did Hashida Itaru tell you?”[%p]
Suzuha frowns.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“He’s worried about you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Geez. I told him not to tell anybody.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well? How do you feel about going to 1975?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...It doesn’t matter how I feel.”[%p]
Suzuha’s expression suddenly hardens.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I have to go. It’s the path I chose, and it’s what my dad wanted.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What if we ask you to stay?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ll go anyway.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“One of those guys on @channel asked what right I have to change the future and decide the fate of the human race. He had a point.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But still... I don’t want the future to turn out like that.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I want the people in my time to be free like you. Free to laugh and play, fight and argue, get sad and cry.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If I change the future, then no one will die. Not you, not Shiina Mayuri, and not my dad.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Maybe I don’t have the right... but I’m going anyway.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Even if you can never return?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Aw, come on! The 70s aren’t a bad time, you know? I’ll find friends there just like you guys. We’ll have a blast!”[%p]
Just like that, Suzuha is back to her usual self.[%p]
But despite her cheerful smile, I am certain that her resolve was forged from fear and doubt the likes of which few can imagine.[%p]
I was a fool to think that my words could sway her.[%p]
