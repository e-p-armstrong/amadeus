Beneath the clear blue sky, the time machine comes to life.[%p]
Daru’s repairs are complete. Mayuri and I help drain the last of the water out of the cockpit.[%p]
The machine is still stuck in Radi-Kan’s wall, but that’s a small matter.[%p]
Daru gazes at the time machine with a satisfied expression.[%p]
Mayuri is jumping for joy, and Kurisu, who ran over as soon as she completed the Time Leap Machine, is visibly relieved.[%p]
Meanwhile, Suzuha is struggling to attach her mountain bike to the time machine’s exterior. She likes it so much, she wants to bring it with her to 1975.[%p]
Kurisu was worried that it might cause a time paradox.[%p]
My heart is still heavy.[%p]
Should I let Suzuha leave like this?[%p]
I chide myself for the thought. It’s not my choice to make.[%p]
Suzuha isn’t from this time. If she doesn’t want to stay, then I have no reason to keep her from leaving.[%p]
Suzuha finishes securing her bicycle and turns to us with a soft smile.[%p]
It’s not the painful, forced smile I saw yesterday.[%p]
We don’t perform a startup test. Activating the time machine would draw too much attention.[%p]
So we’re just going to wing it. Fortunately, we have the Time Leap Machine for insurance.[%p]
My only regret... is that we couldn’t find her father.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Thanks, guys... really. I can’t thank you enough.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Don’t forget about us!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“If you want to thank me, then let’s make out.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Control yourself, perv.”[%p]
The lab mems pat Suzuha on the shoulder and offer words of encouragement, each in his or her own way.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh right. Take this.”[%p]
Suzuha offers me her father’s pin.[%p]
“OSHM***A 7010”. In the end, we couldn’t decipher the inscription.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“This is for you, Okabe Rintaro. Keep it in the lab, will you? Somewhere out of sight is fine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha...”[%p]
Is she regretting her decision to leave?[%p]
Is this pin meant to be proof that Amane Suzuha was here, with us, in this time?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Um... about the pin.”[%p]
Daru hesitates for a moment, then steps forward.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Why don’t we make duplicates for all the lab mems? Make it our symbol, I guess.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow! That’s a great idea!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“How unusually thoughtful of you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ahaha. I... I don’t know what to say.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We already took a picture of it, so keep your pin, Amane-shi. It belonged to your dad, right?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yeah... okay.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I stay silent. There’s nothing I can say.[%p]
I could stop Suzuha from leaving, if I tried.[%p]
But unless she goes, I can’t save Mayuri.[%p]
I...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay everyone! Dahdahdahdah! Mayushii has an important announcement to make!”[%p]
Mayuri suddenly raises her hands and calls for attention.[%p]
As usual, she completely fails to sense the gravity of the situation, though I suppose it’s our fault for not telling her the truth about Suzuha’s time machine. In any case, she has my attention.[%p]
What could her announcement be?[%p]
Could Mayuri have found out that she’s fated to die?[%p]
I quickly glance at Kurisu, but she seems just as confused as I am.[%p]
Then what is it?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Actually... Mayushii found Suzu-san’s dad!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Really!?”[%p]
Mayuri puffs out her chest proudly.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wanna meet him? You do, dontcha? Well, he’s here with us today!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“W-where?”[%p]
Everyone, including me, starts looking around. Mayuri has us hook, line, and sinker.[%p]
I scan the empty event hall, but there’s no one else here.[%p]
Where could he be?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Allow me to introduce you! Suzu-san’s dad is...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Drrrrrrrrrrrr...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Is that a drum roll!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tada! Suzu-san’s dad is...”[%p]
Mayuri flashes Suzuha a grin.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Daru-kun!”[%p]
She thrusts her finger at Daru.[%p]
Our mouths drop.[%p]
After awkward silence comes awkward laughter.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That joke’s not even logical. It’s impossible for this perv to get married in the first place.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hey... that kind of hurts.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I completely agree with Christina. Daru is fated to become a wizard when he turns thirty.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You could be nicer about it, guys... but it’s the truth, so I can’t object.”[%p]
Daru falls to his hands and knees, devastated.[%p]
As for Suzuha herself... she clearly doesn’t know how to react.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Um... you know... my dad wasn’t fat.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Geez. You’re all so mean to Daru-kun.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Mayu-shi’s the only one to stand up for me. You’re an angel, Mayu-shi. Do you love me?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Nope.”[%p]
Harsh.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Mayushii’s one hundred [color index="A0140000"]million[color index="800000"] percent sure that Daru-kun is Suzuha’s dad.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okay. What’s your proof?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, I was thinking about the letters on Suzu-san’s pin...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“After staring at it really hard, I noticed the 7 in ’7010’ looked a little weird.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s not a 7, it’s a 2. The line fell off the bottom.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“R-really?”[%p]
Suzuha stares at the inscription on the pin again.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s so small, I can’t tell...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s easy to see on the picture we took!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“2010? But that’s this year!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then what do the letters mean?”[%p]
“OSHM***A 7010”[%p]
That’s what’s inscribed on the pin.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s easy!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okabe, Shiina, Hashida, Makise. And finally, Amane.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wha...”[%p]
It was right in front of us all along. We just didn’t know where to look.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s our initials!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So I was thinking, why 2010? And then I remembered it’s the year of the lab mems.”[%p]
The year of the lab mems?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The Future Gadget Laboratory was founded this year.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So that’s what it is...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And you know, Suzu-san has lots of stories about future Okarin and future Chris-chan, but not a single story about Daru-kun, right?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“There weren’t any about Mayu-shi either.”[%p]
Daru’s observation startles me. It’s an obvious thing to wonder about, but it strikes too close to home.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Well, Mayushii’s a lab mem, but I can’t make time machines, and I don’t like fighting. Of course I’m not famous!”[%p]
...No. The reason there aren’t any stories about Mayuri is because she dies in a few hours. Only Kurisu, Suzuha, and I know that, and we say nothing.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But Daru-kun’s a super hacka and Okarin’s right arm. He even helped Okarin make PhoneWave-chan. So I thought it was strange Suzu-san didn’t know him.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So you’re saying he used a different name?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Barrel Titor-san helped Okarin found the Resistance, right?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And he was in Akiba in 2010.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And he was able to build his own time machine.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And he knew about Okarin’s Reading Spaghetti--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Reading Steiner.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“He knew about it.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Doesn’t that fit Daru-kun perfectly?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“She’s right.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Do you remember the day Suzu-san went to meet her father?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“She thought he would be at the time machine offline meet.”[%p]
We know that because we tailed her.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Daru-kun was supposed to be there too, right?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That meet was seriously important to the history of Japanese SciFi. At least I got to sneak in while tailing Amane-shi.”[%p]
I don’t remember that. It must have happened because of the D-Mail I sent.[%p]
This is the curse of Reading Steiner. Although I keep my memories from previous worldlines, I don’t acquire memories of events on new worldlines.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Dad told me about that meet when I was little. I don’t remember what he said exactly, but I thought I might be able to meet him there.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So if I’d been at the meet, everything would’ve been okay?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hmm, I don’t know. I don’t think I’d have picked you out as my dad.”[%p]
Still, the evidence keeps piling up.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And then there’s the time machine’s name, FG204 something something... umm, what was it?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“FG204 2nd EDITION ver. 2.31.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Th-that naming sense... it’s got to be Daru!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And FG probably stands for Future Gadget.”[%p]
So Suzuha’s time machine... is Future Gadget No. 204!?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Finally, his name. Barrel Titor has to be Daru-kun!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Come to think of it, last night, Mayuri asked how to say ’barrel’ in Japanese.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Barrel is ’taru’ in Japanese. Right, Chris-chan?”[%p]
Kurisu nods.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Taru... Taru... Daru!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s a pun!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay, Suzu-san! Say ’Hashida Itaru’ ten times fast!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Wh-why?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Just say it and find out! Ehehe!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“HashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaru[linebreak]HashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaru”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Just now, didn’t it sound like ’Ditor’?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It did.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hashidaitaru. Hashi-daita-ru. Hashi-Ditor-ru. Hashi-Titor-ru.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...For reals?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“For super reals♪”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I can’t believe it.[%p]
But with all this evidence laid out in front of me, I can’t deny it either.[%p]
Everyone’s jaw drops again, only this time we’re staring at Daru and Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I think she looks just like her father♪”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That could just be the [color index="820000"]placebo effect[color index="800000"]... but now that you mention it, they kinda do look alike.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nice work, Mayuri! You’ll make a great detective one day.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“A d-detective? Ehehe! That’s the first time anyone’s said that.”[%p]
She’s such a ditz most of the time, but maybe she’s more perceptive than anyone knows.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“My... d-daughter? Amane-shi is my daughter?”[%p]
Daru, wide-eyed, points at Suzuha while flapping his lips like a fish out of water.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Dad...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uh... c-c-could you call me Papa instead?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“For once in your life, don’t be a perv...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Dad...!”[%p]
Suzuha tries to hold back her tears, but can’t. [%p]
They fall from her eyes and roll down her cheeks.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...”[%p]
Seeing this, Daru stops his joking and lets Suzuha speak.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I came, Dad. I came to see you... in the time machine you built.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m going to finish what you started. I promise.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Watch over me. Okay?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m watching. Of course I am!”[%p]
Suzuha walks up to Daru and hugs him gently.[%p]
Daru awkwardly, but firmly, hugs her back.[%p]
Father and daughter, reunited across time.[%p]
I’m truly glad we could bring them together.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“B-by the way, was your mother cute? Request petite girl with cute face and big boobs.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ahaha. That’s a secret.”[%p]
When Suzuha finally steps away from Daru, she’s smiling once again.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Well! That takes care of everything I wanted to do on this worldline.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Guess I should be going.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-wait! You’re going already? Don’t you have more to say to your father?”[%p]
What am I doing?[%p]
Suzuha’s mind is set. I know that nothing I can say will convince her to stay.[%p]
It’s madness to even try. If she stays, Mayuri dies. I know that![%p]
So why am I trying to stop her?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No, I’m fine now. I’m going to get an IBN 5100, just like I promised.”[%p]
She looks at us with the face of a warrior.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ll bring it to you here in Akihabara. That’s my duty, and I’ll see it through. The rest is up to you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Change the future. Please.”[%p]
Nobody speaks. Nobody nods. [%p]
We don’t have the words.[%p]
But she sees it in our faces.[%p]
Resolve.[%p]
Suzuha has entrusted us with her will and her mission. We meet her gaze, each of us, and silently swear to protect them to the end.[%p]
The future Suzuha came from is not the future we desire.[%p]
In Suzuha’s time, Daru and I fought to change it.[%p]
This time, we’ll make sure it never happens.[%p]
Mayuri will live. Kurisu will be free.[%p]
Suzuha will grow up knowing her father.[%p]
We must change the future, that all these things may come to pass.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Well, see you in 35 years... though I guess it’ll only be a few hours for you guys. Ahaha!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, I almost forgot. The time machine gives off terrific ultraviolet rays when it jumps, so make sure not to look directly at it.”[%p]
With that final warning, Suzuha boards the time machine. She waves once, and then the hatch closes behind her.[%p]
Moments later, the machine comes to life.[%p]
A shrill alarm starts ringing.[%p]
There are no other sounds. It makes less noise than I’d expect.[%p]
People on the street below start shouting and cheering at the satellite’s sudden activity. They all look up and point.[%p]
My phone vibrates. I quickly take it out and open it. The mail is from Suzuha.[%p]
Goodbye...[%p]
When I failed to stop her on a previous worldline, she sent me the exact same message before leaving.[%p]
But this time, the word holds a completely different meaning.[%p]
I lift my eyes from the message to see the space around the time machine begin to warp.[%p]
A cocoon of light appears and envelops the fuselage.[%p]
I squint my eyes against the brilliance.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha...”[%p]
We will never see her again. Not this Suzuha.[%p]
Yes, we can seek her out in our time. I know that I will make the effort.[%p]
But the next time we meet, an immense gulf of time will have divided us.[%p]
No matter how hard we wish it were different, she will not be the girl we knew.[%p]
All of a sudden, Daru takes a step into the light.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“S-Suzuha!!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’m sure we’ll meet again!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ll do my best until then! I hate myself for not knowing any other way to say it, but I’ll do my best!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ll do my best, I promise! So Suzuha, do your best too!”[%p]
His words probably can’t reach her anymore.[%p]
As the light grows more intense, I raise my hand to shield my eyes.[%p]
Bathed in radiant particles, the cocoon slowly, slowly unfurls.[%p]
The next thing I know, Suzuha’s time machine has vanished into thin air, leaving a hole the size of a dump truck in Radi-Kan’s wall.[%p]
The air is thick with the smell of ozone, and seems to pulse softly where the machine stood.[%p]
We stand there for a while, staring silently at the empty spot while the summer breeze blows gently past.[%p]
As if the wind were fate itself.[%p]
