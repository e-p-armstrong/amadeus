Unfortunately, we don’t have time to mourn her departure.[%p]
In about an hour and a half, Moeka’s group will attack the lab.[%p]
Before that happens, we need to acquire the IBN 5100 that Suzuha went to 1975 to obtain.[%p]
The time machine’s sudden disappearance has thrown the area into chaos, which makes it easy for us to slip out unnoticed.[%p]
“See you in 35 years,” Suzuha said.[%p]
54-year-old Suzuha should be here in Akiba. Before she left, we decided that the time machine’s disappearance would be her cue to bring the IBN 5100 to the lab.[%p]
But when we return to the lab, there’s no 54-year-old woman waiting for us.[%p]
It seems Suzuha hasn’t come yet.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Haah, whew... whew... no more... running...”[%p]
Kurisu gasps for breath while Mayuri calmly munches on a banana.[%p]
As I check the lab for any sign of Suzuha, a line of red numbers catches my eye.[%p]
The meter reads 0.337187%.[%p]
...Divergence hasn’t changed.[%p]
Reading Steiner didn’t activate this time, so I suspected that might be the case.[%p]
Let’s think this through.[%p]
I thought that divergence would change the instant Suzuha obtained an IBN 5100 in 1975.[%p]
But maybe there’s something else that needs to happen.[%p]
Will it change the instant Suzuha hands me the IBN 5100?[%p]
Or will it change when we use the IBN 5100 to delete my email from SERN’s database?[%p]
At any rate, all we can do now is wait for Suzuha to arrive.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Suzuha’s 54 by now, right?”[%p]
After catching his breath, Daru speaks.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“My daughter is 30 years older than me. I don’t know if I want to see that. Feels weird, man.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You know, it wouldn’t be unusual for her to have grandchildren by that age.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Y-you mean I could have great-grandkids? I don’t know if I’m ready for that, man...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Just be super nice to them! That’s what grandpas do!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Please, don’t call me grandpa...”[%p]
A knock on the door interrupts their idle chatter.[%p]
It must be Suzuha![%p]
Everyone looks at me. With a strange mixture of anticipation and anxiety, I slowly open the door.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Okabe!”[%p]
Instead of an old woman, we get a wall of muscle.[%p]
Our disappointment is palpable.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, it’s you...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Hey, have you seen my part-timer?”[%p]
Mister Braun peeks into the lab.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“If you’re looking for Suzu-san, she went 35 years--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Shaddup, Mayuri!”[%p]
Kurisu covers Mayuri’s mouth.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“You know something? Where’d that girl run off to?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“She took the last couple days off and I don’t know when she’s coming next. She won’t even answer her phone.”[%p]
We don’t have time for this, but I can’t just order him to leave. Not unless I want another cracked skull.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She said she went back to her hometown. She’s probably gone for good.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“What!? You sure?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“That brat. She didn’t say a word to me.”[%p]
The future is changing.[%p]
Isn’t this proof?[%p]
On my previous leaps, Mister Braun never came by the lab.[%p]
This must be related to Suzuha’s trip to 1975. Surely it’s a good sign.[%p]
Now, as long as the attractor field doesn’t amend history again...[%p]
Mister Braun sighs, then turns to me with a serious expression.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Well, whatever. I’ve got something for you, Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...For me?”[%p]
He hands me an envelope.[%p]
It’s addressed to Okabe Rintaro, but there’s no stamp or postmark.[%p]
The name Hashida Suzu is written on the back.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What is this?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“It’s from the lady who used to own this building. She asked me to give it to you on this day.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Uh... who?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“How did you know Suzu-san anyway?”[%p]
Suzu-san?[%p]
Suzu-san... Of course![%p]
The name on the back reads Hashida Suzu. Hashida is Daru’s surname![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where is she now!?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Huh? Uh, she passed away ten years ago.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Passed away!?”[%p]
She’s dead!?[%p]
A wave of dizziness nearly sweeps me off my feet.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...How old was she?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Mid-forties, I think.”[%p]
The age fits.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thank you for taking care of this letter, Mister Braun.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Eh? Eh? Is it from Suzu-san?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Seriously? Why did he have it?”[%p]
Mister Braun clearly doesn’t understand our reaction, and we’re not about to explain.[%p]
I thank him again. He grumbles a bit and leaves.[%p]
As soon as he’s gone, I break the seal and open the envelope.[%p]
Inside is a handwritten letter. The characters are slightly messy, as if her hand was shaking as she wrote it.[%p]
Our eyes, transfixed, begin to read.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]Dear Okabe Rintaro,[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]It’s me, Amane Suzuha. Hashida Titor’s daughter. It’s been a long time.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]Though for you, I’m sure only a few hours have passed.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]The date is June 13th, the year 2000.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]Meaning I’m writing this ten years before you will read it.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I’ll get right to the point.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed[%p]
I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed[%p]
I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed [%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed[%p]
I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed [%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]The date is June 14th, the year 2000.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]About nine or ten years before you will read this.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I failed.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I only remembered who I was one year ago today.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]The day Nostradamus said the King of Terror would come.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]Stupid, stupid, King of Terror. He should have come and burned us all away.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]For 24 years, I forgot who I was.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]All I could remember was my name.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I finally remembered one year ago.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]The day the King of Terror was supposed to come but didn’t.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]There’s no King of Terror, but I want to die.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]The repairs were incomplete. The time machine malfunctioned. When I arrived in 1975, I couldn’t remember anything.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]They found me lying in the street like a broken doll and took me to a hospital.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]Now I’ve been living on my own for years, but that’s as Hashida Suzu, a normal person who forgot the duty and mission of Amane Suzuha I only remembered last year.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed[%p]
I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I failed I’m a failure[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]Something went wrong! I don’t know what. The repairs were incomplete. But it’s not Dad’s fault, it’s mine.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I should have gone straight to 1975. I shouldn’t have stopped in 2010, but I was selfish and now the future is doomed.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]There’s no IBN 5100.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I’m sorry.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I’m so sorry.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]For what purpose have I lived to this age?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I forgot my duty and lived a carefree life instead.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]Now my life has no meaning at all.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]It’s worthless. Worthless. Worthless.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I wish I hadn’t remembered.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I’m glad I finally remembered.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I’m glad I had this chance to say sorry.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me, forgive me, [color index="A0140000"]forgive me, forgive me![color index="800000"][%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]My plan failed.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I spent this whole year asking myself why.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I finally figured it out.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]If I hadn’t postponed my leap to 1975, this wouldn’t have happened.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]Okabe Rintaro.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]After the offline meet, you stopped me from going to 1975.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I was really happy, but that’s where it all went wrong.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I should have left. I shouldn’t have waited. That was my last chance.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]That night, there was a thunderstorm. My time machine was flooded.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]If you can go back to that day, please, please, let me leave.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]Then, I can bring you the IBN 5100.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I can fulfill my mission.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]Please. That’s all I want.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I promised Dad.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]This was his dream.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I want to change the future.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I’m sorry.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I’m sorry.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]I’m sorry.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]My life was meaningless.[%p]
My hands curl, crumpling the page. I realize that I am crying.[%p]
Suzuha failed?[%p]
She lost her memory?[%p]
Her life... was [color index="A0140000"]meaningless[color index="800000"]?[%p]
This can’t be happening.[%p]
Nobody says a word. Their faces, like mine, are frozen in disbelief.[%p]
I turn to Daru. He’s whiter than a sheet.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru... didn’t you fix the time machine?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I... I did... I thought I did... but I mean, that was my first time repairing a time machine. I might have missed something.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Missed something!? Whatever you missed cost your daughter 24 years of her life!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I didn’t do it on purpose!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Calm down, both of you. Hashida did everything he could. He doesn’t deserve your anger, Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How can you be so calm!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s how I am. Sorry. Now calm down.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gh...”[%p]
It’s not Daru’s fault. I know that.[%p]
But it can’t end like this. It can’t![%p]
What was Suzuha feeling as she wrote this letter?[%p]
I look again at the words scrawled upon the page, every character resonant with despair.[%p]
I wanted to welcome her back with a smile.[%p]
Instead... [color index="A0140000"]this[color index="800000"].[%p]
Suzuha is dead, ten years gone.[%p]
...Wait. How did she die?[%p]
Don’t tell me...[%p]
Mister Braun must know what happened.[%p]
I run to the window and check the street.[%p]
Mister Braun is outside, closing up shop.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mister Braun!”[%p]
I run downstairs.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Okabe! Did you hear? That satellite up and disappeared. Everyone’s talking about it.”[%p]
I guess it’s already made the news.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please... I need to know.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Huh? Know what?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hashida Suzu-san... how did she die?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“...Why do you wanna know that?”[%p]
He looks at me hard. I meet his stare unflinching.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I... don’t know anything about how she died.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I need to know what her last moments were like. I feel... that it’s my duty to know. To engrave her memory into my heart.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“...Sounds like you’ve got a reason.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“What I want to know is how you knew her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She was... an old acquaintance.”[%p]
That’s all I can say.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A very old acquaintance... but I still remember the time I spent with her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So please... tell me.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“I don’t like to talk about it... but alright. Listen good, Okabe.”[%p]
I slowly nod.[%p]
And then I get my answer.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“It was suicide.”[%p]
The word drops on my heart like an anvil.[%p]
My knees give out. I collapse to the pavement.[%p]
Suicide.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“She hung herself at home. I was the one who found her.”[%p]
[color index="A0140000"]My life was meaningless.[color index="800000"][%p]
I recall the last words she wrote in her letter. Words of unimaginable despair.[%p]
She didn’t deserve so bleak an end.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“She became unstable about a year before it happened. Before that, she was a nice, cheerful lady.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“This building was hers. She gave me a place to stay.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“She had no relatives, you know. Almost no one came to her funeral. It was a sad thing to see.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“She handed me that letter a week before it happened. Told me to give it to a young man named Okabe Rintaro on this exact date.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“When you moved in upstairs, I thought Suzu-san must’ve seen the future or something.”[%p]
Enough.[%p]
I can’t take it anymore.[%p]
I try to stand, but my legs betray me.[%p]
I stumble, but before I fall, a small body supports my shoulder.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin, are you okay?”[%p]
Mayuri.[%p]
It must be taking all her strength to hold me up.[%p]
Did Mayuri hear how Suzuha died?[%p]
Her eyes are wet. Her lips are trembling.[%p]
Still, she’s the one supporting me.[%p]
Mayuri and I bow deeply to Mister Braun and return to the lab.[%p]
When we get back, Daru is seated at his computer, head on the table.[%p]
Kurisu is standing in front of the TV, watching an excited reporter talk about Radi-Kan.[%p]
The disappearance of the satellite is huge news, obviously.[%p]
The lounge is silent, save for the TV.[%p]
I look at the table.[%p]
The divergence meter still reads 0.337187%. It hasn’t changed since before Suzuha left.[%p]
What went wrong?[%p]
I can’t go back 10 years with the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
I can’t do anything about Suzuha’s death.[%p]
Should I have stopped her from leaving after all?[%p]
Maybe then this tragedy wouldn’t have happened.[%p]
No. What choice did I have?[%p]
I can’t save Mayuri without the IBN 5100. Suzuha had to travel to 1975.[%p]
I consider my options.[%p]
What if I redo these two days again? Could Daru fix the time machine so this doesn’t happen?[%p]
Is fixing the time machine even possible?[%p]
Daru’s skills are second to none, and the time machine was built by his own hand, 26 years in the future.[%p]
It seems logical that he would be able to fix it.[%p]
But look at it another way.[%p]
It took Daru [color index="A0140000"]twenty-six years[color index="800000"] to learn enough to build the time machine, and he had to reverse-engineer SERN’s to do it.[%p]
Maybe it’s unreasonable to expect our Daru to perform flawless repairs in only two days.[%p]
In that case, can I have Daru use the Time Leap Machine and repeat these two days until he repairs it?[%p]
No. He’ll have to start from scratch each time. Two days just aren’t enough.[%p]
I collapse onto the sofa and bury my face in my hands.[%p]
Mayuri sits next to me and gently rubs my back.[%p]
I’m grateful for her kindness.[%p]
I recall what Suzuha wrote.[%p]
“If you can go back to that day, please, please let me leave.”[%p]
...The D-Mail I sent.[%p]
Could that be the cause?[%p]
On the original worldline, Suzuha leapt to 1975 after failing to meet her father.[%p]
Unsatisfied with that outcome, I sent a D-Mail to convince myself to follow Suzuha and prevent her from leaving.[%p]
As a result, she remained in 2010 for an additional four days.[%p]
But that night, the time machine was damaged by a thunderstorm.[%p]
If I hadn’t followed Suzuha that day...[%p]
If I hadn’t sent that D-Mail to myself...[%p]
Her time machine would not have malfunctioned.[%p]
She would have arrived safely in 1975.[%p]
The solution is obvious. I need to cancel that D-Mail.[%p]
But can I really do that?[%p]
If I change the past so that Suzuha leaves, won’t that [color index="A0140000"]undo[color index="800000"] the four days we spent together?[%p]
Our frantic search through the streets of Akiba.[%p]
Her heartfelt confession on the roof of Radi-Kan.[%p]
Her tearful reunion with her father, Daru.[%p]
All of it will be undone.[%p]
What do I do?[%p]
An urgent bulletin pops up on the TV.[%p]
I look up in surprise.[%p]
“Bomb threat suspends Yamanote, Sobu, Keihin-Tohoku Lines.”[%p]
Damn. Moeka’s men will be here any minute.[%p]
There’s no time to think. No time to hesitate.[%p]
I run downstairs, break into the Braun Tube Workshop, and turn on the 42-inch CRT.[%p]
Then I return to the lab and activate the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What are you doing, Okabe!?”[%p]
Kurisu demands answers. I can see the fear in her eyes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We can’t just leave it like this! I have to do something!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But Okarin, are you sure?”[%p]
Don’t try to stop me, Mayuri.[%p]
I can’t let this stand.[%p]
There are two options.[%p]
I can cancel the D-Mail that convinced me to pursue Suzuha. Sending a contradictory D-Mail should do the trick.[%p]
Or I can time leap again and prevent Suzuha from leaving.[%p]
Two options... but really, just [color index="A0140000"]one[color index="800000"].[%p]
Do not hesitate, Okabe Rintaro.[%p]
Hesitation is unforgivable.[%p]
You already know what you must do.[%p]
“Stop pursuit”[%p]
“last mail”[%p]
“is SERN trap”[%p]
That should be enough to convince me to let Suzuha go.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu. You’re good at remembering dates, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Huh? Well, sure...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When did we throw that party for Suzuha?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Four days ago. August 9th.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’re sending a D-Mail, Okarin? But won’t that make everything disappear?”[%p]
Four days.[%p]
It may not sound like much, but in that time, we forged a definite bond with Suzuha.[%p]
To send this D-Mail is to sever that bond.[%p]
I know that. I know that![%p]
But this is the only choice I have.[%p]
I set the PhoneWave to 97 hours ago. This D-Mail should arrive a few hours after the first.[%p]
Now I just need to send it.[%p]
Save Mayuri -- [color index="A0140000"]that[color index="800000"] is my purpose.[%p]
That is what drove me to leap through time.[%p]
I’ll do whatever it takes to save her.[%p]
This is just one more sacrifice.[%p]
Erase the time you spent with Suzuha! Destroy whatever bond you had![%p]
Send the D-Mail![%p]
Push the button![%p]
Isn’t that what Suzuha wants? You’ll be saving her from twenty-five years of loneliness, from ending her life in utter despair.[%p]
Save Suzuha. Save Mayuri.[%p]
This is the right thing to do.[%p]
This...[%p]
Is right![%p]
...But is it really?[%p]
Is erasing those memories really the right thing to do?[%p]
Isn’t that just running away from reality?[%p]
Shouldn’t I try time leaping first? Maybe there’s another way.[%p]
What should I do?[%p]
What’s the right choice?[%p]
Stop. You’re starting to doubt.[%p]
Never doubt![%p]
I don’t know the answer.[%p]
But I need to reach a conclusion, or else.[%p]
I...[%p]
I start up the microwave.[%p]
The discharge begins immediately.[%p]
I place my thumb on the send button.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Are you sure!?”[%p]
Mayuri’s voice is choked with tears.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Our memories with Suzu-san will disappear! Is that really okay?”[%p]
Memories flash through my head.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Being with you guys, even for just a little while... was great.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m going to finish what you started, Dad. I promise.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Well, see you in 35 years... though I guess it’ll only be a few hours for you guys. Ahaha!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Change the future. Please.”[%p]
Suzuha, I’ve made my choice.[%p]
I won’t ask for your forgiveness.[%p]
Ultimately, I’m doing this to save Mayuri.[%p]
But at the same time, the words you spoke on that rooftop are still strong in my heart.[%p]
You entrusted to me your hope for the future.[%p]
If I am to honor that wish, and fulfill mine, then the time we spent together... can never have happened.[%p]
I can’t.[%p]
I can’t do it.[%p]
I can’t send this D-Mail.[%p]
Acting on impulse, I don the headgear and punch in a 48-hour time leap.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Do you have a plan?”[%p]
I ignore her and bite down hard on my lip.[%p]
As the taste of blood fills my mouth, I press the button.[%p]
