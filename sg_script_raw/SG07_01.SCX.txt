The world shatters into geometric shapes that expand and contract like rubber toys.[%p]
Light gathers between my eyes.[%p]
Stars explode behind my eyelids.[%p]
Gradually, color returns to the world.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah!”[%p]
I wait for the vertigo to pass.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Cold sweat oozes from my temples.[%p]
Pressing my fists against them, I slowly force the air out of my lungs.[%p]
Has the worldline changed?[%p]
I head to the lounge in order to check the divergence meter.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s gone...”[%p]
I checked the meter a few minutes ago, just before the worldline changed. Now it’s nowhere to be found.[%p]
I quickly realize what has happened.[%p]
Suzuha gave me the meter after we stopped her from leaving. My D-Mail undid those events.[%p]
Of course the meter isn’t here.[%p]
A surge of regret seizes my heart. I clench my teeth and endure it as best I can.[%p]
If nobody else remembers, then I alone will keep these memories of Suzuha alive.[%p]
I look around the room.[%p]
Mayuri and Kurisu are on the sofa, dozing on each other’s shoulders.[%p]
Daru, oblivious to the vulnerable high school girls behind him, is playing an eroge on his computer.[%p]
I take a deep breath and turn on the TV.[%p]
I flip to a news channel.[%p]
The worldline should have changed.[%p]
I erased the time we spent with Suzuha.[%p]
That should have allowed her to leap to 1975 without losing her memories, and the IBN 5100 should be in our hands now.[%p]
We can use it to hack into SERN and erase the data they intercepted from us.[%p]
Without that information, Moeka’s men won’t attack the lab. Mayuri won’t have to die.[%p]
That’s how it should be.[%p]
That’s how it has to be.[%p]
Otherwise, why did I sacrifice Suzuha’s dream?[%p]
The quickest way to confirm the change would be to check for any delays at Akihabara Station.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, is the Yamanote Line stopped?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? Uh... I don’t think so?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Check online.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait, I’m at the best part.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please.”[%p]
Daru sighs and calls up train information.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm, doesn’t look stopped.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thanks.”[%p]
The worldline has changed.[%p]
Which means that our IBN 5100 should be in the development room.[%p]
I head back there to search for it.[%p]
But contrary to my expectations, I can’t find it anywhere.[%p]
What’s going on?[%p]
I look at my watch. It’s 7:43 PM.[%p]
Moeka’s men attack at... what time again?[%p]
My heart is pounding like a drum.[%p]
That D-Mail was supposed to fix everything. The trains are moving as scheduled, which means that Moeka’s men aren’t about to attack.[%p]
So why does it feel like nothing’s fixed at all?[%p]
The IBN 5100’s absence is extremely disturbing.[%p]
I want to sit down and think about where it could have gone, but a voice in my head is screaming that there’s no time.[%p]
I need to calm down.[%p]
It’s hard to think straight after everything that’s happened.[%p]
I check my watch again. 7:46 PM.[%p]
Images from the assault flash through my mind.[%p]
Mayuri bleeding to death on the floor.[%p]
The smell of gunpowder in the air.[%p]
I frantically shake the visions out of my head.[%p]
I look towards the lab entrance.[%p]
The door has yet to be kicked in by a team of hitmen.[%p]
I swallow hard, petrified with terror.[%p]
Please, don’t let anything happen.[%p]
...It’s past 9.[%p]
I peek at the street through the window.[%p]
Nobody’s there.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Are you waiting for someone? You keep looking out the window.”[%p]
Daru’s right. I’ve probably looked out the window 20 times in the past hour.[%p]
And not a suspicious figure in sight.[%p]
Moeka’s men still haven’t appeared.[%p]
The raid was before 8, if I remember correctly.[%p]
I think it’s safe to say that my changes to the past have prevented it from occurring.[%p]
Suzuha’s sacrifice was not in vain.[%p]
I let out a deep breath.[%p]
I’m sweaty and disgusting. It’s like my anxiety has pushed all the sweat out of my body.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri. Kurisu.”[%p]
The two girls woke up from their nap about half an hour ago.[%p]
Now they’re eating cup noodles.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wait... did you just say my name correctly?”[%p]
Kurisu looks at me in astonishment, like she can’t believe her ears.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When you’re done eating, go home. It’s late, so I’ll go with you.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okeydokey!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t need an escort from you. I can get back by myself.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just listen. Daru, you too.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? Me too?”[%p]
The train lines running through Akihabara are operating normally. There’s no bomb scare, and no sign of Moeka or her men.[%p]
Kurisu’s taking the Sobu Line to the next station, Ochanomizu, while Daru’s going the opposite way to Shin-Koiwa.[%p]
Mayuri and I are taking the Yamanote Line to Ikebukuro, so we part at the station’s ticket gate.[%p]
There are surprisingly few passengers on the train. I guess most of the salarymen are off for the Obon holiday.[%p]
Mayuri is playing a handheld game - the RaiNet Kakeru action RPG. On the screen, her character is battling a gigantic Upa.[%p]
I stand beside her and gaze at her profile, lost in thought.[%p]
It’s the night of the 13th, and Mayuri’s still alive.[%p]
How many times have I watched her die? How many times have I tasted that despair?[%p]
No matter what I did, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t save this ditzy childhood friend of mine from death.[%p]
She died again and again, right before my eyes.[%p]
But now, she’s alive.[%p]
Standing beside me, playing a game.[%p]
This is why I sacrificed our memories with Suzuha. It was the only way.[%p]
I’m sorry, Suzuha.[%p]
And thank you.[%p]
Suzuha no longer exists in this time, but I hope my feelings will reach her all the same.[%p]
...Actually, come to think of it, why can’t I tell her in person?[%p]
Where in Akiba could the 54-year-old Suzuha be?[%p]
I’ll try asking Tennouji tomorrow. He probably knows Suzuha on this worldline too.[%p]
I wonder if Suzuha remembers me.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...Hey, Okarin?”[%p]
Mayuri suddenly lifts her head.[%p]
She looks at me hesitantly. Her cheeks are slightly pink.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Come on, Okarin... Mayushii gets nervous when you stare at her like that...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did I make you get a game over?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry about that.”[%p]
I apologize, but keep looking at her.[%p]
Instead of starting a new game, Mayuri looks at me with concern.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“There’s something different about you today, Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“R-really?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah. What’s wrong?”[%p]
I remind myself that Mayuri is more perceptive than she seems.[%p]
She proved that when she figured out that Daru was Suzuha’s father.[%p]
I don’t want to worry her too much.[%p]
I want Mayuri to smile her usual ditzy smile without a care in the world.[%p]
After all, it’s over now. She’s safe.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh. Nothing’s wrong! And I wasn’t looking at you just now. I was devising new ways to bring chaos to the world. Muhahaha!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really? You seem kind of tired.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A mad scientist is never tired. The mighty gray cells of my 170-IQ brain are always performing calculations, day and night!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh... but you should still take a break every now and then. Please, Okarin. For me?”[%p]
Having said that, Mayuri returns to her game.[%p]
I feel cold stares all around me, but I don’t care at all.[%p]
Mayuri is here with me, doing everyday Mayuri things. Ordinary things.[%p]
Everything is going back to normal.[%p]
