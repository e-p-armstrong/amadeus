Yesterday was my first time home in a while, so I slept like a log in my comfortable bed.[%p]
It could be because of my mental exhaustion, but that was my best night’s sleep in a while.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Before heading up to the lab, I stop and stare at the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
The familiar mountain bike is gone.[%p]
Suzuha liked it so much, she insisted on bringing it with her to 1975.[%p]
The workshop door opens and out comes Mister Braun, rubbing his eyes sleepily.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Okabe! You’ve got free time. How about a job? As a special offer, I’ll hire you for one CRT a month.”[%p]
One CRT a month?[%p]
So for one month’s work, I get an old television?[%p]
Hell no.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When did Suzuha quit, again?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Suzuha? Who the hell’s that?”[%p]
What!?[%p]
Was her existence erased completely?[%p]
But that’s impossible.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“I ain’t got time to remember the name of some lazy part-timer who quit after just ten days.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn you and your misleading words...”[%p]
So Suzuha did work here. That fact -- the evidence of Suzuha’s sojourn in 2010 -- still remains on this worldline.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“And I thought I finally had some help for a change. That’s what I hate about you damn kids. No dedication.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“I bet she lied about liking CRTs, too. Got me good.”[%p]
Tennouji shrugs his shoulders, annoyed.[%p]
Naturally, he doesn’t know about Suzuha’s true identity.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Does the name Hashida Suzu ring a bell?”[%p]
At this, Tennouji’s eyes go wide.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Haven’t heard that name in a long time. Ya knew her?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Eh...?”[%p]
[color index="A0140000"]Knew[color index="800000"] her?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So now, she’s...?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“It’s been ten years already, huh.”[%p]
10 years? 10 years since what?[%p]
No...[%p]
I don’t want to know the answer.[%p]
Tennouji has a faraway look in his eyes, as if he’s gazing into the past.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“She really helped me out.”[%p]
Why are you talking about her in past tense!?[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“She didn’t have any relatives, not that I knew of. I wish I could’ve been with her at the end.”[%p]
At the end...[%p]
There’s only one thing that can mean.[%p]
Even though the worldline changed, Suzuha didn’t survive to the year 2010.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“To tell you the truth, though... she looked peaceful when I found her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Peaceful? She... didn’t commit suicide?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Suicide? Who the hell told you that? Suzu-san was sick. Don’t believe any old thing you hear.”[%p]
She was sick...[%p]
Sickness killed her?[%p]
I shouldn’t feel good about that.[%p]
But I guess you could say it’s better than what happened before the worldline changed.[%p]
That’s what I tell myself, anyway.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“So how did you know Suzu-san?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...She helped me out too, a long time ago. I was hoping to see her again.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Yeah?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“I’m living in her old house now. Wanna come pay your respects at the altar?”[%p]
I nod without a moment’s hesitation.[%p]
Tennouji closes up shop and we head off towards his house.[%p]
From Chuo-dori, we head towards the station.[%p]
I scan the Akiba scenery as we walk.[%p]
Moe stores are still nowhere to be found on this worldline.[%p]
After a little hesitation, I look up at Radi-Kan.[%p]
It’s gone.[%p]
The satellite has vanished.[%p]
All that’s left is the hole it made when it arrived in this time.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When did the satellite disappear?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Uh... about five days ago? You never know what’s gonna happen, huh.”[%p]
Which means Suzuha left before it rained.[%p]
Like Tennouji said, his house is closer than expected.[%p]
We take the train to the next station, Okachimachi, and then walk for about five minutes to a quiet residential area.[%p]
This old one-story house is where Suzuha once lived.[%p]
I walk up to the front of the house, and there I see a familiar sight.[%p]
Suzuha’s bicycle![%p]
For a moment, I can see her there, squatting beside the bicycle.[%p]
But the mountain bike Suzuha rode to the Braun Tube Workshop was shiny and new. Now it’s old and covered in rust.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Suzu-san loved that old thing.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Even when she couldn’t ride it anymore, she’d still polish it every week.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“It’s been sitting there for ten years. Couldn’t throw it away. I’ve maintained it best I could, but I guess nothing lasts forever.”[%p]
I gently put my hand on the seat.[%p]
It’s warm from sitting out in the sun.[%p]
I suppose that, for the few days Suzuha was in Akiba, this bicycle existed in two places at the same time.[%p]
The house isn’t as messy inside as I expected, considering the state of the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
I guess that chipmunk keeps the place clean.[%p]
A wave of nausea hits me as I recall what Nae did at Ochanomizu Station.[%p]
But I tell myself that was just an accident.[%p]
Besides, that incident has already been undone.[%p]
Tennouji Nae has done nothing wrong.[%p]
Next to the living room is a child’s room.[%p]
There’s a child’s study desk and a red backpack on the floor.[%p]
Nae isn’t here.[%p]
Which reminds me. Tennouji’s daughter visits the workshop often, but not once have I seen his wife.[%p]
He couldn’t have married Suzuha, could he?[%p]
I mean, she should have been a lot older than him when they met.[%p]
...But as they say, love knows no bounds.[%p]
Hmmmm... I wonder what really happened.[%p]
I don’t know how I’d feel if those two were married.[%p]
That would make Daru Tennouji’s father-in-law.[%p]
...Actually, that would be kind of interesting.[%p]
I turn to the Buddhist altar to pay my respects to Suzuha.[%p]
There’s no picture of her, so there’s no way to know what Hashida Suzu looked like at the age of 44.[%p]
I make an offering of incense to her, then look around the house again.[%p]
This is the house Suzuha lived in after leaping to 1975...[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“When Suzu-san and I first met, we were neighbors.”[%p]
For some reason, Tennouji offers me a beer.[%p]
When I decline, he shakes his head and starts drinking it himself.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“I was born and raised in Europe, you know.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hah? Is that a joke?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Got a problem? I’ll have you know my English and French are perfect!”[%p]
He... really doesn’t look like someone who lived abroad.[%p]
I guess you can’t judge a book by its cover.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“My parents died ’bout 15 years ago. That’s when I came back to Japan. Or, I guess I should say I came to Japan for the first time.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Suzu-san was living alone next door. She looked after me when I had nowhere else to turn.”[%p]
Alright, now’s my chance. If I’m gonna ask, it’s now or never.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...And you got married?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Huh? Married?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“To Suzu-san.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“You high?”[%p]
Phew.[%p]
I knew she’d never marry a guy like him.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]”She was a pretty stoic lady. Didn’t have much of a social life.” [%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“But she treated me well.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“My house burned down ’bout one year after I moved here. It was my smoking that caused the fire, so I deserved it, but still.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“After I had lost everything, she let me come live here with her.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“That’s not all. The Ohiyama Building, where the workshop’s at? That was originally Suzu-san’s property.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Eh!?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“She sold it to me for cheap. It’s thanks to her the Braun Tube Workshop exists.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“You could say she saved my life.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Once, I asked her why she treated me so well. It wasn’t like we were related or anything.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“But she just smiled and said...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“We all depend on someone’s kindness at some point in our lives. When the time comes, you pass the gift along.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“She was kinda mysterious. She seemed to know exactly how things were gonna happen, like a prophet.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha...[%p]
That was probably her way of repaying Tennouji for looking after her, even if it was just for ten days.[%p]
And so, it came full circle.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“It’s a small world, huh? Never thought I’d meet someone else who knew her.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Oh, right! Wait here a sec.”[%p]
Tennouji goes into the child’s room next door, then returns and places an object on the table.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah!”[%p]
It’s Suzuha’s divergence meter![%p]
Before the worldline changed, it was in the lab.[%p]
But on this worldline, Suzuha brought the meter with her to 1975.[%p]
It’s been in this house for 35 years.[%p]
The tubes read “0.409431%”.[%p]
Divergence has changed, just like Suzuha said.[%p]
This proves that my magic eye, Reading Steiner, does indeed allow me to perceive changes to the worldline.[%p]
But what does 0.409431% mean?[%p]
I recall what Suzuha said.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“When the meter reads over 1%, you’ve made it to the Beta worldline.”[%p]
Does that mean I’m still on the Alpha worldline?[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Do you know what that number means?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“’Cause I sure don’t. All I know is it hasn’t changed a bit these ten years.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“But you know...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“When Suzu-san was on her deathbed, she used to stare at that meter for hours.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Eh...?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“She used to stare at that meter, talking to herself.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Is this the old number? The new number? Did it work? Did it change?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Stuff like that, day in and day out. It hurt to watch.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I touch the device.[%p]
Suzuha.[%p]
In my heart, I reach out to the girl who died ten years ago. To the girl who will be born seven years from now. To the girl who crossed time to save the future.[%p]
Suzuha.[%p]
Thanks to you, Mayuri is safe.[%p]
Divergence has changed.[%p]
But we haven’t yet reached your ultimate goal.[%p]
One percent divergence.[%p]
Once that is achieved, the future you dreamed of will become a reality.[%p]
I will carry on your fight, Suzuha.[%p]
I promise.[%p]
I realize that I am crying.[%p]
Tennouji stares at me for a moment, then puts his giant hand on my shoulder.[%p]
