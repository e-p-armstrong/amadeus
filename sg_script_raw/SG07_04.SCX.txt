The door slams open.[%p]
Five men burst into the lab.[%p]
I recognize them -- the Rounders.[%p]
They aim their guns at us. I freeze.[%p]
Despair seizes my heart. My worst fears have come true.[%p]
It’s happening exactly the same as before.[%p]
Only this time, Suzuha isn’t here to save us.[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“Hands in the air. Nobody move.”[%p]
Even the dark-skinned man’s words are the same.[%p]
Eventually, the unpleasant clack of heels echoes down the hallway.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um... Moeka-san?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“We’re taking the time machine.”[%p]
I suppress my terror and grab Mayuri’s arm.[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“Don’t move!”[%p]
The crew cut man says something he hasn’t before.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Makise Kurisu, Okabe Rintaro, Hashida Itaru. The three of you will come with us.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You cannot resist.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Come with us.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You have nowhere to run.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“We have men stationed throughout Akihabara.”[%p]
What do I do?[%p]
Should I use my concealed Moad Snake right now?[%p]
Use it and then time leap?[%p]
But Mayuri hasn’t been killed yet.[%p]
There’s a chance she might not be killed on this worldline.[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“Hey, you!”[%p]
The crew cut man points his gun at me.[%p]
My heartbeat jumps up. Cold sweat breaks out all over my body.[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“I said hands in the air.”[%p]
I’ve only raised my left.[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“What are you hiding!?”[%p]
I have to use it![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“!!”[%p]
I swallow my fear and activate Moad Snake.[%p]
White smoke instantly fills the room, rendering it impossible to see.[%p]
The Rounders won’t be able to aim through this.[%p]
I have to time leap while it lasts![%p]
I grab Mayuri’s hand and fumble through the smoke towards the development room.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Shoot them!”[%p]
I hear the sound of guns firing wildly behind me.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Augh!”[%p]
Suddenly, Mayuri’s arm gets heavy.[%p]
I trip forward and land on my face.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayu--”[%p]
Our hands were separated in the fall.[%p]
I grope around and soon find her slender hand.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“O...kari...”[%p]
Mayuri’s feeble whisper reaches my ears.[%p]
Was she hit!?[%p]
The Rounder’s blind shot hit Mayuri!?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It... hurts...”[%p]
Mayuri’s voice quickly fades away.[%p]
Strength drains from her fingers.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri! Come on! Get up!”[%p]
But Mayuri doesn’t answer.[%p]
...I’m sorry, Mayuri.[%p]
Once again, I’ve failed to save you.[%p]
I thought I’d succeeded, but I was wrong.[%p]
I hear my teeth grinding in my head.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Stop! Stop!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Don’t shoot meeeee!”[%p]
I hear Kurisu and Daru screaming as the gunfire continues.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Guh!”[%p]
A sharp pain flares at the top of my head.[%p]
I press down with my hand. It comes away soaked with blood.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah, aahhh...”[%p]
It hurts it hurts it hurts![%p]
It feels like someone took a saw to my skull.[%p]
My ears are ringing.[%p]
I stumble. I can’t stand up straight.[%p]
I need to get to the Time Leap Machine![%p]
I squeeze Mayuri’s limp hand one last time, then crawl to the development room, fumble for the headgear, and put it on.[%p]
I point the remote at the hole and press the power button.[%p]
The TV turns on downstairs. I can hear people laughing on the screen.[%p]
[name]Attacker A[line]“Target A, Target C secured.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Run, Okabe! Run!”[%p]
Shit![%p]
I clench my fists in frustration.[%p]
The Time Leap Machine is already activated.[%p]
The discharge phenomenon is starting.[%p]
The floor begins to shake.[%p]
Once again...[%p]
I leap to the past.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah!”[%p]
The world collapses, then reforms.[%p]
Once again, I feel that odd numbness behind my eyes.[%p]
The pain at the top of my head is gone.[%p]
I wipe the sweat off my brow and look around.[%p]
I can’t see Moad Snake’s vapor any more. The air is clear.[%p]
Kurisu is reading a western book like usual.[%p]
Mayuri is playing a handheld game while eating a banana.[%p]
Daru isn’t here. I recall he said he was going out somewhere.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayu--”[%p]
I quickly swallow my words.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin? You want a banana too?”[%p]
When I wave my hand no, Mayuri tilts her head quizzically, then goes back to her game.[%p]
I sink into the sofa and close my eyes.[%p]
Somehow, I resist the urge to scream in frustration.[%p]
I have to think.[%p]
I erased our memories with Suzuha. I changed the worldline. But it wasn’t enough.[%p]
The divergence meter still reads 0.4%.[%p]
How do I get that above 1%?[%p]
Wait. If I try to solve the problem alone, it’ll just end the same way.[%p]
I need to consult Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu, come with me a second.”[%p]
I lead her out of the lab.[%p]
