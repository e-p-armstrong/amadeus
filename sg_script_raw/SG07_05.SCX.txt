We sit on the bench in front of the building. Suzuha’s bicycle is still absent.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What is it? You don’t normally say my name normally.”[%p]
Kurisu frowns at her own words.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That came out weird.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please... help me.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Now this is a shock.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I never thought I’d hear those words from you. Do you have a fever?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No jokes. I seriously need your help.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You time leaped, didn’t you?”[%p]
I nod.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How much do you know?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“How much do I know about what?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How about Suzuha being John Titor?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh!?”[%p]
Kurisu gives me a blank stare.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It never even occurred to me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
When we prevented Suzuha from leaving on August 9th, she ended up staying until August 13th.[%p]
But that outcome was changed by my last D-Mail.[%p]
What happened during those four days on this worldline?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you finished the Time Leap Machine?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What are you talking about? I finished it yesterday after an all-nighter, remember?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“When did you leap from?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“8 PM tonight.”[%p]
It looks like I’ll have to explain everything all over again.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hmmm...”[%p]
I told her about Mayuri’s many deaths, and about what happened with Suzuha and Moeka. I also gave a summary of what Suzuha told me about the structure of the universe.[%p]
Kurisu does not appear to doubt my story.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So basically, you win if you get the IBN 5100 back.”[%p]
Kurisu sums up what I told her.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This is just a guess...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But maybe you should look at what Amane-san said from the opposite angle.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I think the critical change takes place when you get the IBN 5100 and erase the data in SERN’s database.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That instant is most likely when you’ll achieve divergence over 1%.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The problem is where the IBN 5100 is now.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’ve already found it once. That is, if your memories are real.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you can get back to the worldline where you first obtained it, then isn’t it bound to return to you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see... You’re right.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The IBN 5100 was at the lab, and then it suddenly disappeared.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You threw a fit about that earlier. I remember thinking, ’Oh god, Okabe’s finally lost his ability to distinguish fantasy from reality.’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re such a wannabe American. What do you mean, ’oh god’? Oh, I get it. Chris-chan is a Chris-tian.”[%p]
Kurisu looks at me in disdain as soon as those words leave my lips.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s terrible.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I regret it too.”[%p]
This is no time for puns.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, Christina... let me see if I understand what you’re saying.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The changes we made to the worldline -- namely, all of the D-Mails we’ve sent -- must be reversed.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That will return us to the worldline where I found the IBN 5100 at Yanabayashi Shrine.”[%p]
From what I’ve experienced so far, I’m confident that the IBN 5100’s disappearance from the lab wasn’t due to theft.[%p]
After all, I was sleeping at the lab. And whenever I wasn’t around, another lab mem was. The lab was occupied every hour of the day.[%p]
It would have been impossible for someone to steal that heavy computer without anyone noticing.[%p]
It makes more sense to assume that a D-Mail caused us to diverge from the worldline where I found the IBN 5100 at Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s still a hypothesis. I only came to that conclusion based on your explanation.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you’re mistaking your facts, deceiving me, or shooting off delusions, then this hypothesis will fail.”[%p]
This assistant of mine has no confidence in me at all.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You can’t just blindly follow this hypothesis either.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You may have a safety net, but if you get careless and leave yourself without a way out...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then you’ll never get another chance to save Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I know that.[%p]
I’d ask for Suzuha’s opinion too, if she were here, but on this worldline, she traveled to 1975 on the night of August 9th. There’s no way I can speak to her now.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why did the IBN 5100 disappear? Which of the D-Mails caused its disappearance?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Figure that out, and you’re well on your way to finding the solution.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What I don’t understand is how we delayed the timing of Mayuri’s death exactly 24 hours.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“True, that is interesting. Maybe it’s related to the change in divergence.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It could be the Butterfly Effect. If that’s the case, any trivial change could produce a significantly deviant result.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]”Anyway, it’s important to act with discretion. Don’t do anything careless.” [%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Your death, Okabe, is the worst thing that could possibly happen.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re probably the only person who can remember previous worldlines. If you die, then consider Mayuri dead for good.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Don’t die. Okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...You’re not [color index="A0140000"]worried[color index="800000"] about me, are you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“W-what!? Don’t be ridiculous! Why should I care!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m not worried about you, okay? Don’t get the wrong idea.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I just don’t want to lose a valuable test subject, that’s all. Yeah!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That brain of yours has accumulated memories spanning worldlines and time leaps. It’s a precious sample that can rewrite the history of neuroscience!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I want to map your brain and find out just what’s going on in there.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In other words, your time leaping helps me, too! After all, the Time Leap Machine is the fruit of my research, so to speak, and I--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Calm down.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu turns away with a sour expression.[%p]
This assistant of mine can be difficult sometimes.[%p]
Anyway.[%p]
I consider her hypothesis. In order to return to the worldline where I found the IBN 5100 at Yanabayashi Shrine, we need to cancel all the D-Mails we sent so far.[%p]
The theory is sound, and I’ve got nothing else to go on.[%p]
I check the clock. It’s 6:42 PM.[%p]
Only one hour until Moeka’s raid.[%p]
I decide to time leap once more, to the afternoon of the 13th, just before the Time Leap Machine is completed.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina. I’m going to give this plan of yours a shot.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh. G-great.”[%p]
I take Kurisu’s hand and grasp it firmly.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ah...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’ve been a great help. Sorry for the trouble.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“D-don’t apologize, dummy. It’s confusing...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And besides, I don’t even remember helping you before! How are you going to take responsibility for this!?”[%p]
Why is she getting mad at me? I just don’t understand her.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I wish I could remember too...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then I’d always have something to rub your nose in!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You really have an awful personality.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re one to talk.”[%p]
With that, I leap 28 hours into the past.[%p]
