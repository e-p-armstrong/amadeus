Time leap complete.[%p]
I’m standing in the lab, as usual.[%p]
My brain feels like it’s been pinched.[%p]
I endure the pain as I check my watch.[%p]
It’s 1:47 PM.[%p]
Kurisu’s almost done with the Time Leap Machine, and Mayuri’s almost done with Lukako’s costume. They should both be done in about 10 minutes.[%p]
I leave the lab and sit on the bench in front of the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
Let’s go over the plan.[%p]
Cancel all the D-Mails that have changed the past so far.[%p]
Of course, that includes D-Mails sent by people other than me.[%p]
Specifically, I’m only concerned with the D-Mails that triggered Reading Steiner.[%p]
We sent several of them as experiments.[%p]
For example, Operation Urd Stage Two, the LOTO SIX experiment, involved one such D-Mail.[%p]
But the real problem is what other people sent.[%p]
Mayuri and Kurisu haven’t sent any D-Mails.[%p]
Daru sent his past self a strategy to win the Faris Cup, but Reading Steiner didn’t activate, so divergence must not have changed.[%p]
That leaves three D-Mails to deal with -- those sent by Moeka, Lukako, and Faris.[%p]
The most problematic is the one Faris sent, which is also the most recent. I have no idea what it said, so I don’t know how to cancel it.[%p]
Faris’s D-Mail caused a dramatic change to Akiba.[%p]
All of the moe stores disappeared.[%p]
That’s my only hint.[%p]
I’m the only one who remembers how things were before the change, so I won’t get an answer from Faris, even if I ask her directly.[%p]
But still, I have to at least try.[%p]
I should get in touch with her.[%p]
First, let’s try contacting her by phone or mail.[%p]
Meeting face-to-face would be best, but MayQueen doesn’t exist on this worldline. Meaning I’d have to go to that high-class apartment complex.[%p]
I should try contacting Faris first.[%p]
I decide to call her.[%p]
The ring tone echoes in my ears.[%p]
It’s not connecting.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn!”[%p]
I stab the End button and open up my mailbox.[%p]
I’ll write Faris a mail.[%p]
Just give it to her straight.[%p]
I send it.[%p]
Afterwards, I sit and stare at the screen, waiting.[%p]
I’ve already tried sending three mails and calling four or five times, but 30 minutes pass without a single response.[%p]
Unable to hide my frustration, I storm off towards Faris’s apartment.[%p]
I arrive at the tall apartment building soaked in sweat.[%p]
I’ve been running an awful lot lately. It’s made me realize how out of shape I am.[%p]
I wish I worked out more.[%p]
This complex has an automatic lock, so I have to call up from the lobby intercom.[%p]
I enter the number for Faris’s apartment, and a man’s calm voice soon replies.[%p]
[name]Butler[line]“May I ask who’s calling?”[%p]
Judging by the voice, it’s not Faris’s dad, but her butler.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Um, my name’s Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’d like to speak with Fari... I mean Rumiho-san.”[%p]
[name]Butler[line]“I regret to inform you that the young mistress is currently out.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then where is she now?”[%p]
[name]Butler[line]“I’m afraid I cannot answer that. You may be someone with whom she does not wish to interact.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve been here before, remember!?”[%p]
[name]Butler[line]“Of course, sir. However, I still cannot disclose the location of the young mistress. Please contact her directly.”[%p]
He’s obviously trying to end the conversation, so I panic to get the last word in.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“P-please wait! I’ve been trying to get in touch with Faris, but she’s not returning my calls or emails!”[%p]
[name]Butler[line]“Then please try again some other time.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Guh!”[%p]
Frustrated by this new turn of events, my anger threatens to boil over.[%p]
Damn inflexible geezer![%p]
I leave the lobby.[%p]
MayQueen+Nyan² doesn’t exist on this worldline.[%p]
Faris isn’t responding to my calls or emails either.[%p]
Where could she be?[%p]
Underneath the incandescent heat of the sun, I suddenly get an idea.[%p]
Daru. If anyone knows where Faris is, it’ll be that stalker of hers.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Yeah? Okarin?”[%p]
Hm? It’s awfully noisy on the other end of the phone.[%p]
But I don’t care about that.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, do you happen to know where Faris is right now?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Faris-tan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I need to talk to her right now!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Right now? That’s not gonna happen.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just tell me where she is! You keep tabs on her at all times, don’t you!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“I know where she is, sure.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where!? Where is she!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“In the UPX assembly hall.”[%p]
UPX...[%p]
I look up.[%p]
I’m standing right in front of UPX.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why the assembly hall?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Today’s the finals of the RaiNet AB GC.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“RaiNet AB GC?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Short for RaiNet AccessBattlers Grand Championship, duh.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“It’s the finals, man. Faris is participating.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Faris-tan was the winner of this year’s winter GC, so she’s the defending champion. Just so you know.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She’s... in the finals?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“I’m here too, spectating. The match has already started, man.”[%p]
So that’s why![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m headed there now. What floor!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Do you have a ticket?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, but I’ll manage!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“I don’t know, man. Security’s pretty tight. Someone posted threats on @channel.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Pretty sure you’re not getting in.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then you come out. I’m in front of UPX. Can you lend me your ticket?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“No way.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“It’ll end at four, so can’t you just wait until then?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“H-hey! Daru! Daru!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gh...!”[%p]
That inflexible bastard![%p]
Looks like I don’t have a choice.[%p]
All I can do is wait like Daru suggested.[%p]
At 4:00, tons of people spew out of the building.[%p]
They’re mostly parents with children, but there are also men and women in their 20s and 30s.[%p]
Seems like a wide customer base.[%p]
Some people are dressed in cosplay, and others are carrying RaiNet goods and paper bags. They’re the ones you’d expect to be here.[%p]
Maybe I should try calling Faris again.[%p]
The match should be over.[%p]
Why won’t she pick up!?[%p]
My frustration peaks.[%p]
I tell myself to calm down, but it doesn’t work.[%p]
One obstacle after another! I’m on the verge of losing it![%p]
I pace back and forth as I watch the exiting crowd.[%p]
I try calling Daru again, but now even he’s not answering.[%p]
Looks like I don’t have a choice.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Excuse me.”[%p]
I approach several men gathered near the UPX entrance.[%p]
They’ve got tattered leather jackets and excessive silver accessories. Not the sort of people I usually hang out with.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you know where RaiNet Champion Faris-san is?”[%p]
[name]???[line]“What!?”[%p]
They suddenly give me dangerous looks.[%p]
[name]???[line]“RaiNet Champion Faris-san?”[%p]
[name]???[line]“Pff, you guys hear that?”[%p]
The man tosses a grin to the other members of his posse.[%p]
Snobby, unpleasant laughter resounds.[%p]
I struggle to suppress my anger.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you know, then please tell me.”[%p]
Now the man directs his grin towards me.[%p]
[name]Man Who Seems to Whisper to Gaia to Shine More[line]“What, you’re a friend of the former champ?”[%p]
Former champ?[%p]
While I’m puzzling this out, the man suddenly steps right up in my face.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“!?”[%p]
Something smashes into my forehead. Stars explode behind my eyes.[%p]
I fall onto my back.[%p]
It’s hot above my brow, as if a branding iron was pressed to it.[%p]
But that quickly fades to a dull throbbing.[%p]
I finally realize that the nutcase headbutted me.[%p]
What the hell!?[%p]
Why would he do that?[%p]
Did I do something to this guy?[%p]
Or is he a Faris [color index="820000"]hater[color index="800000"]?[%p]
I stagger to my feet.[%p]
The man stoops to pick up his hat, which fell off when he headbutted me.[%p]
That’s when I see it.[%p]
Right on top of his head, there’s a small space devoid of hair. There’s no way I could miss it.[%p]
A bald spot.[%p]
[name]Man with a Bald Spot Who Seems to Whisper to Gaia to Shine More[line]“Sorry, but you asked for it.”[%p]
[name]Man with a Bald Spot Who Seems to Whisper to Gaia to Shine More[line]“It made my dirty heart ache to hear you call that pussy a champion.”[%p]
[name]Man with a Bald Spot Who Seems to Whisper to Gaia to Shine More[line]“Get it? Don’t you ever call that disgusting catgirl a champion to my face again.”[%p]
[name]Man with a Bald Spot Who Seems to Whisper to Gaia to Shine More[line]“Not unless you want your body and soul frozen by yours truly, the king of the streets, the one and only Black Absolute Zero, 4℃.”[%p]
What the hell is this guy talking about?[%p]
He’s obviously living in his own stupid world.[%p]
[name]Man with a Bald Spot Who Seems to Whisper to Gaia to Shine More[line]“The name’s 4℃. That’s Shido, you get me? I’m the strongest and coolest RaiNetter to ever rule the streets of Akiba. Nobody comes close. Nobody.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Did you know? Dry ice is so cold, it burns.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s not a burn. It’s frostbite.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“What!?”[%p]
When I point out the scientific truth, the man with a bald spot and his lackeys get pissed.[%p]
This doesn’t look good. I don’t have time to get into a fight.[%p]
I decide to stage a tactical retreat.[%p]
Afterwards, I go to the assembly hall and ask the staff about Faris. No luck.[%p]
When I try calling Daru again, he says “Maybe she went home already?” in a bummed-out voice.[%p]
I return to Faris’s apartment building and ring the intercom again. The butler responds once more.[%p]
[name]Butler[line]“May I ask who’s calling?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s Okabe. Has Fari... has Rumiho-san returned?”[%p]
[name]Butler[line]“...Just a moment.”[%p]
It sounds like she’s home.[%p]
The intercom goes silent for a while.[%p]
And then, the door’s automatic lock opens, allowing me inside the elevator hall.[%p]
[name]Butler[line]“Please come up, sir. The young mistress will see you.”[%p]
I give him my thanks and hurry into the elevator.[%p]
