The butler guides me into the bedroom, where Faris is sitting on the sofa, hugging her knees.[%p]
She doesn’t look up, even when I approach.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris! Finally. There’s something I need to ask you.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hmmya...”[%p]
She looks exhausted, like all the life has been drained out of her.[%p]
I’ve never seen Faris like this.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What happened? You look down.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“This can’t be happening, nya. Why did Faris have to lose, nyan?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If only those guys hadn’t used underhanded tricks on me, nya... They ganged up on Faris...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I even promised Papa I’d win... he’s probably disappointed in me, nya... I’m too ashamed to show my face, nya...”[%p]
What is she saying?[%p]
No, wait.[%p]
I think I get it.[%p]
I recall what happened after Faris’s final match in the RaiNet championship.[%p]
That leather-clad asshole called her the former champ.[%p]
I guess that means she lost. And that’s why she’s depressed.[%p]
I feel bad for Faris, but I don’t have time to deal with this.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Listen, Faris!”[%p]
Faris blinks her eyes repeatedly when I grab her by the shoulders.[%p]
But her eyes are glazed and empty of light.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A couple of days ago, you used the time machine we invented to send a D-Mail. Do you remember that?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hanya?”[%p]
I knew it was useless, but I had to ask.[%p]
Faris doesn’t remember.[%p]
In fact, from her perspective, it never happened.[%p]
How do I explain?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s say, for example, that there used to be tons of stores for anime otaku here in Akiba.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And let’s say you used a time machine, and changed that Akiba into the electric town it is today. How would you do it?”[%p]
I know it’s a really cryptic question.[%p]
But I can’t think of a better way.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Time... machine...”[%p]
Faris murmurs with a blank expression on her face.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Time machine...”[%p]
She repeats the same phrase.[%p]
Faris’s eyes gradually regain their brightness.[%p]
And then, all at once...[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma...”[%p]
She presses up against me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-whoa! What!?”[%p]
She smells good.[%p]
Faris’s cat ears tickle my nose.[%p]
I go stiff, not knowing what to do about this sudden turn of events.[%p]
Faris looks up at me.[%p]
She looks so desperate. I feel my heart pound faster.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Is it a real time machine, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yeah. It’s real.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...”[%p]
Faris stares at me even more intensely, like she’s trying to see inside my soul.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I believe you, nyan.”[%p]
Just when I get the feeling she believed me way too easily, she suddenly starts clutching her head.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Ugh... ugh... I’m about to remember, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris remembers using the time machine, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha... Really!?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Umm, Faris got on the time machine and it went zoom and...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? But you didn’t ride anything, you sent a D-Mail to the past.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyanya! That’s it, nya, I’m starting to remember more and more, nya.”[%p]
Faris then holds her head and looks at me with tears in her eyes.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“My head... hurts, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s going on here?”[%p]
Does Faris have Reading Steiner too?[%p]
I don’t know. I need to find out, but how?[%p]
Calm down. I need to think.[%p]
Should I contact Kurisu?[%p]
Or should I...[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma... Faris is... Faris is...”[%p]
Faris continues to cling to me.[%p]
And all I can do is hold her warm, soft, slender body in my arms.[%p]
I need to make her remember somehow.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“My brains are turning to mush, nya...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hang in there!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is there anything I can do?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If I win...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If I win, I might remember, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Win? Win what?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Today’s match, nyan. Against the Viral Attackers, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I only lost because of their underhanded tricks, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“And now my head is all mushy, so I can’t remember anything, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Please, Kyouma... I think that if I win the match, I’ll remember everything, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So please, nyan, let me use the time machine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By the way, this isn’t an act, right?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“A-an act? What do you mean, nya?”[%p]
Don’t tell me she just wants to use the time machine to win her RaiNet match?[%p]
Considering her personality, that’s actually pretty likely.[%p]
After all, this is a girl who twists men around her finger.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You’re awful, nya.”[%p]
And then Faris starts crying into my chest.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Even though Faris is trying her bestest to remember for you...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You called me a liar... it hurts, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah, no, I’m sorry.”[%p]
Tears emerge from the corners of her eyes.[%p]
I have no idea what to do in this situation.[%p]
Judging by her tears, I don’t think she’s lying.[%p]
But there’s really no basis to the theory that she’ll remember if she wins the RaiNet tournament.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Please, nya...”[%p]
Faris whispers into my ear.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Help Faris win, nyan...”[%p]
Immediately afterward, I feel something warm and wet on my earlobe.[%p]
Faris brushes her teeth against my ear, sending electricity through my entire body.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-wait! I get it! I get it, okay!?”[%p]
I quickly pull away from Faris.[%p]
That was dangerous. I almost exploded.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“O-okay, Faris. We’ll do it your way.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Fur real, nyan!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. I need you to remember, whatever it takes.”[%p]
Faris tries to throw her arms around me, but I quickly evade.[%p]
She face dives into the sofa awkwardly.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hnnya... why’d you dodge, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Um... You’re being way too familiar.”[%p]
I’m not good at dealing with Faris. She’s using me here, I’m sure.[%p]
...I’m being tricked, aren’t I?[%p]
I shake my head. Even so, I have no choice but to help her win the tournament.[%p]
I’ll try anything that could possibly yield results.[%p]
As long as I keep doing that, I’ll find a solution eventually.[%p]
I have to believe that.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m going to leap to this morning and give you some advice that will allow you to win. How’s that?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“We’re not sending a mail, nyan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Our lab has developed a device for time leaping, or sending your consciousness to the past.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Awesome! So it’s like New Game+, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Umm, yeah, that’s it.”[%p]
Don’t play along. Whatever you do, don’t play along.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So if Faris uses it to go back to this morning, it’ll solve everything, nya!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can’t!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nya!? Why not, nyan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t let anyone else use the Time Leap Machine.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“No fair, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not something to be used lightly. It’s dangerous.”[%p]
It has yet to fail once so far, but my luck might not last forever.[%p]
Suzuha lost her memory after traveling in a broken time machine.[%p]
Her time machine was different, of course, but something similar could happen with the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
Considering the Time Leap Machine’s low budget and rushed schedule, it wouldn’t be surprising if it broke somehow.[%p]
And there’s one more thing.[%p]
I shouldn’t allow anyone else to change the past.[%p]
My goal is to return to the worldline with the IBN 5100, then use it to escape from the Alpha Attractor Field.[%p]
The fewer changes made, the better.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll be the one responsible for changing the past.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Trust me, Faris.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...Okay, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Guh...”[%p]
I brace my wobbling feet.[%p]
As my vision recovers, I check the clock.[%p]
It’s 10:38 AM. The time leap was successful.[%p]
According to Faris, she lost the match due to cleverly-concealed interference from the opposing team.[%p]
Faris told me how to counter that. Her plan...[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Bring Faris sunglasses and earplugs before the match, nyan!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Then I can ignore the distractions and win fur sure, nya.”[%p]
I wonder if she’s right...[%p]
No, now’s not the time to doubt.[%p]
Faris said she would arrive at the assembly hall around 12.[%p]
I head to UPX, making sure to buy sunglasses and earplugs on the way.[%p]
