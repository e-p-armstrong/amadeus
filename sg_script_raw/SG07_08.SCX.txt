There’s still half an hour before the tournament begins, but there’s already a line outside of UPX.[%p]
I didn’t think there would be many participants since it’s already the finals, but it turns out there’s another tournament for the general public at the same time.[%p]
The opening act, so to speak.[%p]
The participants enter the hall through a different entrance than the spectators.[%p]
I’m at the participant entrance, waiting for Faris to make her appearance.[%p]
After about 15 minutes, Faris appears.[%p]
She lives right next door to UPX, so she’s got a lot of leeway time-wise.[%p]
She’s got her cat ears and her maid uniform on.[%p]
It feels strange to see her wearing that uniform despite MayQueen not existing on this worldline.[%p]
Faris’s eyes open wide when she sees me.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma, what are you doing here, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I waited here because I wanted to see you.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hanya!? A-are you confessing your love for me? I don’t know what to do if you confess right before such an important match, nyan!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“D-don’t be ridiculous! Why would I confess to you?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...You’re awfully serious today, nya. Usually you play along more, nya.”[%p]
I don’t have time to be Hououin Kyouma now.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’m nervous about the finals, so I want to lift my spirits, nyan.”[%p]
She doesn’t look nervous.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please just listen to me, Faris! This is important for your victory.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Important? But you don’t even know the rules of RaiNet, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not about the rules or anything like that.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Then what is it, nya?”[%p]
She peers at me with questioning eyes.[%p]
I’d better give her the goods before I screw this up.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Take these with you.”[%p]
I try handing over the sunglasses and earplugs I bought on the way here.[%p]
But Faris pulls back, as if on guard.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma... that’s lame, nya...”[%p]
How rude![%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You’re supposed to bring nicer presents, like--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not a present. These are countermeasures!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Listen good. I came from the future.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I know, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What!?”[%p]
She knows? How!?[%p]
Why!?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“And Faris came from space, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Don’t forget, this is Faris NyanNyan we’re dealing with.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not joking around here! I seriously leapt here from six this evening!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know the outcome of today’s RaiNet GC final.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Don’t tell me. Overwhelming victory for Faris--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You lose.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyau...”[%p]
Faris frowns.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But that’s only because of the opposing team’s interference. So to protect you, I brought you these sunglasses and earplugs.”[%p]
I desperately try to convince her, but Faris just hangs her head, making it hard to read her expression.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you listening!?”[%p]
I grab Faris’s slender shoulders. She’s shaking.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Unyaaaaa!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma, you meanie!”[%p]
And then she suddenly explodes![%p]
[name]Faris[line]“This is a very important match for Faris, nya! How dare you say I’ll lose nya! You’re being mean! Are you a Viral Attackers spy, nya!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“N-no, look, it wasn’t your fault you lost. It’s--”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hmya! Not listenyan!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hgg...!”[%p]
After a swift kick to my shin, Faris turns her back to me in a huff.[%p]
Damn you, catgirl! For once in your life, listen to me![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-wait! I said wait!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I need you to win, no matter what!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Like I said, there’s no way I can lose, nya!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“And I don’t wannya wear those ugly glasses, nya! Faris needs to be cute at every moment! My fans are counting on me, nya!”[%p]
Crap, she’s getting angry at me now.[%p]
Faris shakes me off and runs to the participant entrance.[%p]
I’m not a participant, so if she makes it inside, that’s the end of it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please hear me out!”[%p]
Bearing the pain in my shin, I force my way in front of Faris and stand in her way.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris, please. Mayuri’s life depends on it!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Someone! Someone come here, nya! Help me, nyan!”[%p]
Faris suddenly starts shouting.[%p]
She grabs the attention of the surrounding participants and spectators. Even staff members are gathering.[%p]
Crap, I can’t talk about time machines or Mayuri’s life with this much attention around us.[%p]
But unless I can get Faris to listen to me, there’s no way I can undo her D-Mail.[%p]
What should I do?[%p]
[name]???[line]“You seem to have an awful lot of time on your hands. Eh, Champion?”[%p]
That smug voice.[%p]
A tall man dressed entirely in black walks up to us with a grin on his face. Whenever he takes a step, all of his silver accessories jingle.[%p]
He dramatically takes off his sunglasses, revealing the face of that guy who gave me trouble before. If I’m not mistaken, he called himself 4℃ or something like that.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Heh. Swooping down unto the street, I am the black peacock of the RaiNetter realm.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“The name’s 4℃. That’s Shido, you get me? I’m the leader of the Viral Attackers.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“The Viral Attackers...”[%p]
Hm? The Viral Attackers. I think I’ve heard that name somewhere before...[%p]
That’s right! They’re Faris’s opponents this match![%p]
They’re trying to start a fight now.[%p]
This is a guy who headbutts people out of nowhere.[%p]
And he seems to hate Faris, for some reason.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Seriously, you disappoint me, Champion.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“You flirt with the system, but that’s just noise to my heart. And yet here you are, before the match, soaking in the corrupted love of that worthless man.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“You put on the airs of a siamese cat, but with this duel today, I’ll dye that white fur of yours jet black. Gaia has thus whispered.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“The black cat is the sign of disaster. My black radiance shall outshine your shadow, ushering in a new generation of RaiNet. Women are already slaves to the living Rock Mind that is myself.”[%p]
Damn, this guy can talk. Though I have no idea what he’s saying.[%p]
Faris seems to be thinking the same thing.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Why is everyone getting in Faris’s way, nya? I can’t hear myself think, nya!”[%p]
With that said, she quickly tries to enter the hall.[%p]
But I grab her hand to detain her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris, I told you to wait!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Paws off!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m begging you, please listen to what I’m saying!”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Hey! Don’t you dare disregard the man closest to the truth of RaiNet.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is none of your business. Go away.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“The hell you say! Don’t you know I’m the black nobleman of the RaiNet realm!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Weren’t you the black peacock of the RaiNet realm? Get your story straight.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“I’m the black peacock nobleman. ’Cause black is the symbol of RaiNet.”[%p]
The promotional posters all have a blue and white motif. It doesn’t look like black is the image color to me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, I get it. You just like to say ’black.’”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“You think you’re so smart. I’m gonna dye that pussy black before the duel even starts.”[%p]
4℃ approaches with an angry look on his face.[%p]
But I’m the one who should be angry. Mayuri’s life hangs in the balance.[%p]
Faris isn’t cooperating either.[%p]
I can’t believe this is happening.[%p]
How can I get this guy to go away?[%p]
After a moment’s consideration, I decide to face him as Hououin Kyouma.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“You know what’ll happen if you touch me? Dry ice burns!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s frostbite, you idiot.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Wha!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m telling you to stop messing with Faris!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Save your bullshit for someone who cares!”[%p]
I hear giggles from all around.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Heh! They’re laughing at you, you corrupt pussy l’amant!”[%p]
What the hell is a l’amant?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I think not! They’re laughing at you, you pathetic peacock with a bald spot on your head.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“What!? How do you know about my untouchable black spot!? I’ve never told anyone about it!”[%p]
4℃’s face turns red.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Elementary, 4℃ (YondoC). I am an insane mad scientist and traveler through time! Nothing escapes the sight of Hououin Kyouma.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“The name’s Shido!”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Now you’ve gone too far! For the sin of insulting my ultra-cool badass name, I’ll summon you to my garden, the black HELL! Just you wait!”[%p]
He puts on his sunglasses and leaves.[%p]
Consider this payback for the headbutt.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“How did you know about 4℃’s weak point, nyan? Nobody’s ever seen it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Haven’t you been listening? I came from the future.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Ah...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So please, Faris, take this stuff. Just hold on to it, okay?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“B-but... there’s no way Faris can lose, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re stronger than them, no question. But you heard him just now. They’re obviously not gonna play fair.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They’ll do anything it takes to win, even if it breaks the RaiNetter code.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If you say so...”[%p]
Looks like my desperation paid off.[%p]
Faris reluctantly accepts the two items I present to her.[%p]
Of course, she doesn’t take them out of the bag.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’m just going to hold onto them. Is that okay, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. Just make sure you have them with you on the stage. I promise you’ll need them.”[%p]
Sooner or later, she won’t have a choice.[%p]
