The theme song to RaiNet Kakeru plays through the hall, signaling the start of the finals.[%p]
There’s a kind of majesty to the scene.[%p]
The tension of the crowd peaks as its voltage reaches a climax.[%p]
[name]Announcer[line]“Thanks for waiting, everybody! The finals are about to begin, and we’ll see once and for all who is the RaiNet AccessBattlers Grand Champion!”[%p]
[name]Announcer[line]“These two teams are about to clash!”[%p]
[name]Announcer[line]“First up, the defending champion! Our queen! The Moe Maid Cat!”[%p]
[name]Announcer[line]“Fariiiiis! NyaaanNyaaaaaaaaaan!”[%p]
Faris makes her entrance to thunderous cheering.[%p]
She smiles brightly and waves to the audience. She really is like a queen.[%p]
I notice she’s not wearing the sunglasses I gave her.[%p]
[name]Announcer[line]“And now, the challengers! Like a comet they suddenly appeared, blazing across the starry sky! The dark horse -- nay, dark peacock of the RaiNet world!”[%p]
[name]Announcer[line]“This is their very first tournament, but despite various troubles including no-show opponents, they have made it to the finals! They are the Black Absolute Zero!”[%p]
[name]Announcer[line]“The Viraaaaal! Attackeeeeers!”[%p]
The Viral Attackers consist of 4℃ and some short guy with the same black leather fetish.[%p]
They look like a couple of punks straight out of Ikebukuro.[%p]
I sit in stupefied awe as the excitement around me builds.[%p]
Daru taps me on the shoulder.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You gotta cheer for Faris-tan too!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
Oblivious to my anxiety, Daru starts jumping and waving his hands in the air.[%p]
[name]Spectator A[line]“Faris-tan!”[%p]
[name]Spectator B[line]“I love you, Faris!”[%p]
[name]Spectator C[line]“Moe moe!!”[%p]
Cameras flash as everyone tries to get a picture of the catgirl.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’m gonna give it my best, everyone! So cheer for me, nyan♪”[%p]
The speakers carry her cute, cheerful voice to every corner of the hall.[%p]
Apparently, they gave microphones to both teams so that they could talk to the audience.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Ehehehe. Service shot, nyan♪”[%p]
Faris puts on an impish smile and turns to the audience in a sexy pose.[%p]
Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooah![%p]
The entire hall shakes with the audience’s roar.[%p]
Faris’s popularity is overwhelming.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“There it is! Yes! Faris! It’s me! Marry me!”[%p]
Daru has totally lost it.[%p]
I wonder if Faris will be alright.[%p]
Judging from her enthusiasm, it certainly looks like she’ll be fine.[%p]
Once the cheering dies down, I speak to Daru.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How come there are two Viral Attackers, but Faris is all alone?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What? You don’t even know about that?”[%p]
I’m not familiar with the rules of RaiNet AccessBattlers. I had Daru explain them before the finals started, but he only covered the basics.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“In this tournament, duels take place between two-man teams. But since there’s nobody strong enough to be Faris-tan’s duel partner, she goes alone.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Two heads are obviously better than one, but Faris can win despite her handicap! That’s why I love her!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“These Viral Attackers... what sort of team are they?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hmm. I don’t know all the details, but apparently they’re a pretty aggressive team.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But other than that, there’s a bunch of suspicious rumors about them.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“They’ve got a lot of followers, you see. And apparently, they don’t mind using those followers to interfere with their opponents during duels.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“About half the teams they faced in the championships were no-shows.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And that’s not all. Apparently, they even go around beating up otaku in Akiba and Ikebukuro.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Long story short, RaiNetters really hate them.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then why haven’t they been disqualified?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Cause there’s no evidence. RaiNetters are mostly kids and otaku. Just a little intimidation from some guys in black, and they clam up.”[%p]
The Viral Attackers...[%p]
Faris told me that their interference cost her the game.[%p]
But as long as she’s got the sunglasses and earplugs I gave her, she should be able to win.[%p]
And if she wins, she might be able to recall the contents of the D-Mail she sent. At least, that’s what she said.[%p]
I need Faris to win.[%p]
Mayuri’s life depends on it.[%p]
I’m counting on you, Faris![%p]
Faris rises to the stage, heralded by thunderous cheers.[%p]
And naturally, on the other side is 4℃.[%p]
They face off across the Circuit Mat.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How do teams work exactly?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You can discuss with your partner what moves to make. It’s harder for the opponent to predict what you’re going to do.”[%p]
So basically, the partner just plays a support role.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, there’s nothing to worry about. Faris-tan can beat the daylights outta these punks in the blink of an eye.”[%p]
[name]Announcer[line]“Are both teams ready?”[%p]
The referee gathers Faris and the two Virals for a coin toss to decide who takes the first turn.[%p]
[name]Announcer[line]“And now, for the RaiNet AccessBattlers Grand Championship Finals--”[%p]
Instantly, silence falls on the assembly hall.[%p]
Everyone holds their breath in anticipation.[%p]
[name]Announcer[line]“Duel Access!”[%p]
The referee’s shout signals the start of the game.[%p]
The room erupts in cheers.[%p]
First up is Faris.[%p]
The huge monitor hanging from the ceiling displays the Circuit Mat -- the thing that looks like a chessboard.[%p]
The cards glitter and sparkle in the stage lights.[%p]
All cards on the board are face down, but each player is allowed to peek at his or her own cards.[%p]
The cameras are oriented in a way that the audience can’t see what cards they have.[%p]
According to Daru, RaiNet AccessBattlers is a game of psychological warfare. It’s all about figuring out where your opponent has placed his cards.[%p]
Each player starts with four Link Cards and four Virus Cards, for a total of eight cards face down on the board.[%p]
The victory conditions are a little complex, but in short, you win if you take four of your opponent’s Link Cards or if you make your opponent take four of your Virus Cards.[%p]
The game starts with each player trying to figure out how the other has placed his or her cards.[%p]
Knowing your opponent’s layout lets you shift the game to your advantage.[%p]
That’s why it’s important to be careful what moves you make, whether you’re attacking or defending.[%p]
Your Duel Partner’s there to make it harder for your opponent to read your thoughts.[%p]
I watch as the duel between Faris and the Viral Attackers unfolds before my eyes. Every time a Link Card or Virus Card is revealed, waves of excitement ripple through the audience.[%p]
I’m starting to understand just how amazing Faris must be to become champion all by herself.[%p]
The audience is on the edge of their seats.[%p]
As best as I can tell, it looks like the Viral Attackers are, true to their name, on the attack.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What sort of strategy does Faris use?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I guess you could say she’s a slow starter. She spends the first half focusing on reading her opponent’s cards. She plays it safe.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And instead, she waits until the endgame for a sudden reversal.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That’s probably how she’ll play it this time, too.”[%p]
But contrary to Daru’s expectations, Faris charges into enemy territory with a card equipped with a skill called Line Boost.[%p]
Undaunted, the Virals meet her attack head-on, countering with their own Line Boost-equipped card.[%p]
Oddly enough, Faris makes the first move.[%p]
She waits for the Virals to overextend themselves, then snatches one of their cards using her Line Boost-equipped card.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Now, what’s it gonna be?”[%p]
We won’t know if the card she took was a Link Card or a Virus Card until she opens it.[%p]
The card Faris snatched is...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“No way!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What happened!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I can’t believe it. She took a Virus Card...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“She almost never goes on the offensive. Maybe the Virals are enough of a threat to warrant a change of strategy.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Pff, looks like our pussy champ here is frightened by the heavy rock wings of the black peacock. Your fear is showing.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“I can see your cowardly pussy-shivering with these fallen angel eyes of mine.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“This little ’strategy change’ of yours? It’s an obvious fake. My elegant evil heart whispers so.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“I’ve done my research. You never go on the offensive. You’re the cautious, thinking-type.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“I know all about your little mind tricks. You can’t fool me.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“That card you attacked with just now is a Virus Card, no doubt. You think I’ll take the bait, don’t you?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“This black nobleman set off a red alarm in your heart, awakening your wild survival instincts. And that’s why you suddenly changed your strategy.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“But it’s too late for that now. Such inelegant tricks as that have not a chance to stain our blackness.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“For we are the Viral Attackers, the Black Justice. The usurpers of RaiNet. The rebellion against this fickle Sanctuary.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“He sure can talk...”[%p]
And I still have no idea what he’s saying.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I hate those guys.”[%p]
Faris was radiant when she greeted the audience, but now her cheer and luster have evaporated in the face of 4℃’s taunts.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Well, you gotta admit. Pressuring your opponent is an important part of RaiNet.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“If you shake your opponent up, their reaction might help you figure out their card layout.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...This game sounds pretty hardcore.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“To tell you the truth, RaiNet’s more popular with adults than with kids. Even the anime’s like that. It’s marketed towards kids, but the story’s going down a pretty hard route.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That, and Kirari-chan’s sexy!”[%p]
Like I care, perv.[%p]
Only three minutes have passed since the start of the duel, and Faris is already frowning.[%p]
She’s also fidgeting in her seat, as if there’s something bothering her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A laser!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Eh? What?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Look! Near her eyes! There’s a red dot!”[%p]
It appears in short intervals, so it’s difficult to spot, but there’s definitely a laser shining in Faris’s eyes.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...Seriously?”[%p]
Daru stares at her eyes for a few seconds, then shakes his head.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I can’t tell. But if you’re right, Okarin, then someone in the audience is trying to sabotage her! Damn those Virals!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why doesn’t the referee stop them!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“They must be timing it so that the referee doesn’t see.”[%p]
The audience is huge. It’s impossible to tell where the beam is coming from. There could be multiple lasers, for all I know.[%p]
Now I get it. This is why Faris asked me to bring her sunglasses before I time leaped![%p]
Put on the damn sunglasses, Faris![%p]
Alas, my telepathic message doesn’t reach her.[%p]
I clench my teeth and stand up.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hey, where are you going!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m going to find whoever’s doing this and stop them!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But how are you gonna find them in this crowd!?”[%p]
I ignore Daru and begin wading through the sea of spectators in search of my target.[%p]
Meanwhile, the game is still proceeding.[%p]
Faris takes the card she used for her first attack, and instead of sending it into enemy territory for another attack, pulls it back to fortify her defenses.[%p]
The Virals respond by unleashing a massive assault on her line.[%p]
They equip a card with Line Boost -- which allows it to move twice -- move it twice, and then unequip it. Then they equip Line Boost to another card and move that.[%p]
It looks like their strategy is to attack in waves. They even seem willing to make sacrifices, to a certain extent.[%p]
And of course, the Virals are most likely attacking with a mix of both Link Cards and Virus Cards.[%p]
In order to survive the onslaught, Faris is forced to capture some of their cards in retaliation. But each Virus Card she’s tricked into taking puts her at even more of a disadvantage.[%p]
Faris looks very unsettled by 4℃’s unpleasant smile. The laser attacks must really be getting to her as well.[%p]
And finally, she makes a careless move that truly seems desperate.[%p]
Disbelief spreads through the hall.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Hey hey hey!”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Looks like this fucking cat got scared of my elegant evil charisma aura, and lost her cool heart.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Who would’ve thought the champion would make such an amateurish move?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...”[%p]
Amateurish?[%p]
I was too busy searching for the Viral underlings in the audience to pay attention to the match, but this new turn of events causes me to look up to the monitor.[%p]
Faris has moved one of her pieces to the other side of the board, the entrance to the Viral Attackers’ server.[%p]
But the Virals must have used their Virus Checker card, because Faris’s card is face up. It’s a Virus Card.[%p]
Every card you send into the enemy Server is added to your total. Normally, you try to get Link Cards through, as that brings you closer to victory.[%p]
However, you’re not required to reveal any cards you successfully send into your enemy’s Server. So although it hurts your point total, you technically can send Virus Cards into your enemy’s Server.[%p]
But for some strange reason, Faris is trying to send a [color index="A0140000"]revealed[color index="800000"] Virus Card into her enemy’s server.[%p]
Even if it gets through, she won’t be fooling anyone.[%p]
Moreover, Faris has already taken three Virus Cards. One more, and she’ll lose. So she can’t send that card through even if she wants to.[%p]
So what exactly was she trying to accomplish?[%p]
Is she really that distracted by the laser beam?[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Allow this elegant evil storyteller, 4℃, to make a jet black proclamation.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“In just a few minutes, you’ll be demoted to [color index="A0140000"]Former[color index="800000"] Champion!”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Hahahaha!”[%p]
Someone in the audience echoes 4℃’s vulgar laughter.[%p]
So that’s where his underlings are![%p]
I push my way through the audience in the direction of the laughter.[%p]
The rest of the audience starts booing.[%p]
I guess most RaiNetters really do hate the Virals.[%p]
But Faris herself doesn’t respond to 4℃’s taunts.[%p]
She just bites her lip and closes her eyes.[%p]
Come on! Just put on the sunglasses![%p]
This cute-things-only policy of hers is going to cost her the match.[%p]
Or maybe...[%p]
Maybe it’s impossible to prevent Faris from losing.[%p]
Maybe convergence will bring about the same result, just as Mayuri is doomed to die no matter what I change.[%p]
The audience gasps.[%p]
The Virals have snatched a Link Card from Faris.[%p]
Now they have a total of two Link Cards.[%p]
I can feel it. Faris is losing.[%p]
But just then, I catch sight of a few guys dressed in all black.[%p]
One of them is surreptitiously aiming a pen-shaped object at the stage.[%p]
It’s him![%p]
I grab his wrist.[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker C[line]“Wh-who are you!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s as far as you go. I won’t let you interfere with Faris’s match!”[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker C[line]“Why you!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Move and I shoot!”[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker C[line]“...!?”[%p]
I thrust something into his side. It’s Future Gadget No. 1, the Bit Particle Gun.[%p]
I remembered how this bluff worked with Moeka on a previous worldline, so I brought it just in case.[%p]
The man freezes. I guess he didn’t expect to be held at gunpoint at a children’s card game event.[%p]
Taking advantage of his surprise, I snatch the laser pointer out of his hand, then disappear back into the crowd.[%p]
The punk starts shouting, but gives up when he can’t find me.[%p]
Good. That takes care of the laser.[%p]
Now Faris can focus on the game![%p]
A scream goes up from the audience.[%p]
4℃ has snatched another one of Faris’s Link Cards.[%p]
That’s the third one. The Virals need just one more to win.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Too weak, Pussy. But it’s your fault for flirting with the system in that getup of yours. Save that vomit-inducing fashion sense for your bedroom mirror.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“All of your fans are just otakus who wanna do you. Does it really make you that happy to to have a fanbase filled with people like that?”[%p]
Faris still doesn’t respond.[%p]
She hasn’t said a word since the match started.[%p]
But I got rid of the interference, so Faris should come up with a reversal any second now.[%p]
I stare at her, praying for a miracle.[%p]
And when I do, Faris once again turns her face away, as if trying to avoid something.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What!?”[%p]
Is it another laser!?[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Hey, Champion. They say your eyes can see into a man’s soul.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“They say you have the power to read minds, which makes you a cheater even my pure black evil heart can’t abide.”[%p]
What? She does?[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Basically, ya ain’t human. You’re an ugly angel. ’Cause you peek into the heart of any poor sap who talks to you.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Everyone, beware! Keep your distance! Or this pussy will steal your every secret by reading your thoughts!”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“And then she’ll blackmail you. Hand over your money? Throw your RaiNet match? What will you demand next!?”[%p]
The audience begins to murmur.[%p]
If Faris does have that kind of power, then it’s no wonder she’s so good at RaiNet.[%p]
My chuunibyou imagination starts to run wild, but I try my best to keep it suppressed.[%p]
If Faris really can see through lies, it would explain why she hated the laser beam attacks so much.[%p]
It would also explain why her moves made so little sense this match.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...ctory”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Ah? What was that?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...I use Change Directory. Nya.”[%p]
Change Directory is a special type of card called a “Terminal Card”.[%p]
Once per game, it allows you to switch the placement of two of your own pieces. Of course, you may also [color index="A0140000"]pretend[color index="800000"] to switch them.[%p]
Additionally, if either of the two cards was exposed by Virus Checker, it gets flipped back face down.[%p]
I get it![%p]
With Change Directory, she can switch out that Virus Card she placed near the enemy’s Server![%p]
And just as expected, Faris exchanges the Virus Card with a card that 4℃ has surrounded with his cards. Or maybe she just [color index="A0140000"]pretended[color index="800000"] to.[%p]
Either way, nobody knows which card is the Link Card and which is the Virus Card. Nobody except for Faris, that is.[%p]
A pretty interesting ploy.[%p]
But will it work?[%p]
The Viral Attackers whisper to each other. Once they’re finished, 4℃ returns to the Circuit Mat with a shit-eating grin on his face.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“You can’t touch my heartstrings with a boring move like that. Is this your huge reversal plan?”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Sorry, but I am the black peacock no woman can resist. The elegant evil New Generation of the RaiNetter realm.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“My cool black brain easily sees through your trick.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“No, that wasn’t even a trick. That was a complete blunder, Champion.”[%p]
Without a moment’s hesitation, 4℃ captures the piece Faris placed next to his server.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Heh! I still only have two Virus Cards. One card ain’t enough to clip these jet black wings of mine.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“But if I take just one more Link Card, then it’s the ’End of Grand Cross’ for you!”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“By the way, that card you’re protecting way back in your territory...”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“That’s the card you used in the opening. The one you equipped with Line Boost and used to attack me, as if inviting me to take it.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“I said it before, but there’s no way a scaredy-cat like you would send a Link Card out where it could be captured.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“In other words, Champion, according to my elegant evil skills of deduction, your last Link Card isn’t the one you’re guarding. It’s one of the two you switched! Heh!”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“So I don’t even have to check. This black peacock’s sexual eyes can already see my elegant victory. They can see the contents of your crazy cards!”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“You exchanged one Virus and one Link.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“So all I’ve gotta do is take both, and victory belongs to us black noblemen.”[%p]
Wait... is that right!?[%p]
If the card 4℃ takes now is a Link Card, then he wins.[%p]
But even if it’s a Virus Card, it’ll still be match point. And then he’ll know which card to take for sure.[%p]
It’s going to end without Faris demonstrating any of her power.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Card Open!”[%p]
And the card displayed on the monitor is...[%p]
[name]Announcer[line]“A Virus Card!”[%p]
Is it over?[%p]
The Virals have taken three Link Cards and three Virus Cards. Match point.[%p]
But 4℃’s right. That doesn’t even matter.[%p]
Faris only has two cards left.[%p]
And 4℃ already knows which is the Link Card and which is the Virus Card.[%p]
Faris’s Link Card is surrounded by the Virals’ cards.[%p]
There’s nowhere to run.[%p]
Does this mean Faris is going to lose?[%p]
No way.[%p]
There’s gotta be some advice I can give her![%p]
Gh, can’t think of anything.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“The End. The world has dyed black the closing of this RaiNet century.”[%p]
4℃ poses as if in ecstasy, with both hands stretched wide and his chin cocked up.[%p]
His attitude disgusts me.[%p]
I clench my fists.[%p]
It looks like I’ll have no choice but to time leap again and force Faris to wear the sunglasses.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“The Black Revelations have been fulfilled. The Pussy Champ has fallen from grace to Former Champ. We, the Viral Attackers, now raise the curtain to the highest, grandest, sexiest New Genera--”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“What are you talking about, nya?”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Ah...?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“This match isn’t over yet, nyan!”[%p]
Faris is back to her usual speech patterns![%p]
She’s even got a fearless smile on her face.[%p]
That’s not the look of a RaiNetter facing certain defeat.[%p]
And then, Faris pulls something out of her ears.[%p]
Wait, earplugs!?[%p]
Those are the ones I gave her this morning![%p]
She wore the earplugs, but not the sunglasses?[%p]
Why? To catch the opponent unprepared?[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Wh-what dreamy nonsense are you spewing? The match is already won. You’re just pawing at the ground.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Why don’t you check the card you just took from Faris, nya?”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“...What?”[%p]
No way![%p]
The card he just took wasn’t a Link Card!?[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“N-no freaking way! In the name of all that is elegant and evil, that’s just impossible! That’s bullshit!”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“There’s no way you’d shoot yourself in the foot by wasting Change Directory to switch two Virus Cards--”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Just turn over the card and see for yourself already, nya♪”[%p]
4℃ slowly flips over the card he took from Faris.[%p]
The entire audience waits for the card to be revealed...[%p]
And then, displayed on the monitor--[%p]
[name]Announcer[line]“What!? Just when we all thought the card was a Link Card!”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“A V-v-virus Card!!?”[%p]
[name]Announcer[line]“A HUGE! TURN! A! ROUUUUUUUUUUUUND!!”[%p]
She did it![%p]
She... really turned defeat into victory![%p]
It’s like she knew exactly what was going to happen.[%p]
She was in control of the battle all along.[%p]
The audience goes wild.[%p]
Their cheers shake the hall.[%p]
[name]Announcer[line]“We have our winner! Fariiiis NyaaanNyan! Two time undefeated champion! Congratulatioooons!”[%p]
As the hall rocks with the jubilation of the crown, Daru and I clasp hands and share in the excitement of Faris’s victory.[%p]
