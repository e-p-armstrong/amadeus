With the tournament over, I wait for Faris outside the hall.[%p]
I sent Daru home already. I’ll have to tell Faris about Mayuri soon, and I don’t want him to hear it.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma!”[%p]
Suddenly, Faris runs up to me, paying no heed to the curious stares of the crowd.[%p]
She’s still in her maid clothes, and she’s carrying two bouquets of flowers, which she received from her adoring fans.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Congratulations on your victory, Fa--”[%p]
Faris jumps at me before I can finish.[%p]
She jumps into my arms, embracing me, and there’s a warm feeling against my cheek.[%p]
A k-kiss? Was that a kiss?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Thanks for everything, nyan!”[%p]
Faris smiles innocently. It’s like her entire body is glowing with pure joy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“N-no... I can’t have you thanking me like this. I need something else from you.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“What’s that, nya? You mean a kiss isn’t enough, so you want to go on a date, nyan? Aww, Kyouma, you’re so greedy, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But you know, Faris doesn’t mind, nya♪”[%p]
Faris puts on an impish smile.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m glad those earplugs I gave you did the trick. So get off, it’s too hot.”[%p]
I forcefully pry Faris’s body off me.[%p]
Everyone is staring at us.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’m sorry for doubting you, nya. It wouldn’t have been such a close game if I just believed you to begin with, nya.”[%p]
Faris bashfully paws at her head.[%p]
I take that paw of hers and leave the scene.[%p]
We get to the overpass, and finally lose sight of all the tournament spectators.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris. Now you’ll listen to what I have to say, right?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I brought you sunglasses and earplugs. But I didn’t come up with the idea.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Really, nya? Then who--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You did.”[%p]
Faris looks at me in confusion.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“To be precise, the you two hours from now. The first time, you lost to the Viral Attackers’ underhanded tactics.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And then you asked me to use my time machine to stop them.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Your time machine...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This was a contract, so to speak. You almost remembered the D-Mail you sent to change the past, even though you should’ve forgotten.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You said that you’d remember if you won the RaiNet tournament.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“???”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well? Do you remember? It’s very important, so I need you to try.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hm...”[%p]
Faris stares into my eyes, as if she’s looking for something.[%p]
Then she puts a finger against her lips in thought.[%p]
Finally, she smiles.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris was probably pulling your tail, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“That Faris was depressed she lost to the Virals, nya? So when she heard about the time machine, she wanted to use it to win, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Because if she didn’t, she’d be too ashamed to see Papa, nya...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’m sure she just played along with Kyouma, and said she remembered... that’s what I think, nya... That’s probably what Faris would do, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No way...”[%p]
Damn! I was a fool to trust this catgirl![%p]
I should’ve expected this from how she normally acts![%p]
I breathe a deep sigh and lean on the overpass’s guardrail.[%p]
So in the end, all that work was for nothing.[%p]
I still need to fix the warped timeline, but I don’t know the contents of Faris’s D-Mail.[%p]
Faris forgot it ever happened, and it isn’t in her send history.[%p]
What should I do?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma.”[%p]
And suddenly, Faris whispers into my ear.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Look into Faris’s eyes, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Just look, nya.”[%p]
Faris’s face is right beside mine. Her breath tickles my ear.[%p]
We’re awfully close.[%p]
Does she plan to kiss me on the lips this time?[%p]
But her expression is uncharacteristically serious, so I gulp and do as I’m told.[%p]
I turn to Faris and stare down into her eyes.[%p]
Faris looks up at me too.[%p]
If an outsider were to see us, they’d think we were a couple lost in our own world.[%p]
This is the closest I’ve ever been to Faris. I’m captivated by the beauty of her features.[%p]
Wow... her eyelashes are really long.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nervous, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“O-of course not. I’m busy solving [color index="820000"]Fermat’s Last Theorem[color index="800000"] in my head.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“In other words, you’re nervous, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“The truth is, Faris has only one power, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your power? Do you mean...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It’s a secret, but I’ll make an exception for Kyouma. Truth is, Faris can read people’s minds, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I call my power [color index="820000"]Cheshire[color index="800000"] Break.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Whatcha think, nya? Awesome, nyan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I’m an exception? But the Virals knew about it too, didn’t they?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I had no idea the cat was out of the bag, nya.”[%p]
I won’t deny the existence of supernatural powers. After all, I have one of my own, called Reading Steiner.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Ever since I was small, I could tell what Papa’s business partners were thinking from the looks on their faces, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It’s more like intuition or a sixth sense, nya. Based on eye movements, facial expressions, and gestures, I can tell when someone’s lying, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Wait, so you’ve been using that power at RaiNet tournaments?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Of course, nya♪ Faris is an entertainer, nyan. It’s my style to get into a tight spot on purpose so I can make a huge turnaround, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Besides, if I wear sunglasses, I can’t read my opponent’s thoughts, nyan.”[%p]
Is that why she didn’t put them on?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It’s because of this power that I knew you weren’t lying.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But you wouldn’t go along with me at all in the beginning, though.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You just rubbed my fur the wrong way, nya.”[%p]
It feels like she’s tricking me again.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“And I can tell you’re not lying now either, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris used that ’D-Mail’ thing to change the past, nya? I believe you, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I wish I could remember... but I’m sorry, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I can’t remember, nyan...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see...”[%p]
We’ve reached an impasse.[%p]
I have no choice but to look for some other way.[%p]
