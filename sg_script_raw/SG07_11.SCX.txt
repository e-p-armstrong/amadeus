[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
I suddenly feel intense stares on us.[%p]
I realize that we’re surrounded by people.[%p]
Are they jealous Faris fans who think I’m her boyfriend!?[%p]
I shudder at the thought, but I don’t think that’s the case.[%p]
Then who are they?[%p]
Moeka’s Rounders!?[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Yo.”[%p]
A man clad in black steps forward.[%p]
Oh, it’s the bald spot guy again.[%p]
What does he want now?[%p]
I realize that the men surrounding us are all dressed like 4℃. So are all of these guys Viral Attacker underlings?[%p]
4℃’s gaudy white teeth shine.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“I’ve got a word with you, champion. Gaia whispered for me to register an objection.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“An objection?”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“You damn pussy. The power to read the minds of your opponents? That’s bullshit! I know you were cheating!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She wasn’t cheating! You’re the ones who were cheating!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris doesn’t use underhanded tricks like you guys, nya.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“The hell you say? I, the black nobleman, swear to the god of the elegant evil realm, that I never cheat! Though sometimes I do other things.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Okay, you corrupt white Siamese cat? I ain’t gonna accept that defeat. That last Change Directory was a fraud.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You don’t have any proof.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Heh! You seem clueless, so I’ll tell ya. If I say it’s black, it’s black. That’s the truth of RaiNet.”[%p]
These guys came here to make completely false accusations.[%p]
It doesn’t look like they’ll take no for an answer.[%p]
And they’ve surrounded us so we can’t escape.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“By the way, your old man’s some kind of big shot in Akihabara, isn’t he?”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“I bet he pulled strings so they’d let you win. That’s what all the hip RaiNetters are saying, you know?”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“You’re such a scoundrel. Ya ain’t got a bit of elegant evility. Ya ain’t even a white Siamese cat.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“You’re a fatass pig, crawling in the mud.”[%p]
The crowd grows louder.[%p]
Beyond the wall of Viral henchment, there are some homebound RaiNet spectators watching from a distance.[%p]
The Virals start jeering loudly.[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker A[line]“Seriously? I thought it went way too well, but you’re telling me it was rigged?”[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker B[line]“This catgirl’s the worst!”[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker C[line]“So that’s the kind of person Faris is. A filthy cheater!”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“That’s how it is, Champion -- no, SHAMpion.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“On your knees. Bow before me, the Black Lucifer, 4℃. Rub your head on the ground, and beg for mercy.”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“And then forfeit your throne. Do all that, and I swear to Lucifer to forgive you for your deeds.”[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker D[line]“That’s right! Turn down your victory!”[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker E[line]“And never come back to RaiNet AccessBattlers again!”[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker F[line]“Quit RaiNet, you bitch!”[%p]
Jeers fly from the surrounding Virals.[%p]
None of the onlookers approach. I guess they don’t want to get involved.[%p]
What a farce.[%p]
How long do we have to listen to this?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s go, Faris.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nya...?”[%p]
I grab Faris’s wrist and force our way through the surrounding Virals.[%p]
As we run from the place, I look back and see--[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Hold it right there!”[%p]
4℃ and his group are chasing after us.[%p]
All we can do is run.[%p]
A phone call? Now!?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hello!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“It’s me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What!? I’m! Busy! Now!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“You still at the hall?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“You haven’t seen Faris-tan, have you? Actually, everything’s on fire--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“On fire!? What is!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Her blogs and fan sites!”[%p]
Damn! The Viral Attackers must be flooding the net with false accusations.[%p]
Those scumbags![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m hanging up!”[%p]
I press the End Call button and run even faster.[%p]
There’s no way I can pick up now![%p]
I ignore the call and run even faster.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma! Those guys! Are still tailing us, nyan!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Tch...!”[%p]
Keep running. Just keep running![%p]
While gasping for oxygen, I pull Faris by the hand and run faster.[%p]
We zigzag through the streets of Akiba until we loop back to UPX.[%p]
Faris’s home is right next door.[%p]
We should have gone there first.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Haah, haah, whew!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Haahaah, whew, whewww...”[%p]
My lungs are on fire.[%p]
My legs are aching.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma! Look, nya!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
Faris tugs at my sleeve, stopping me.[%p]
I look at where she’s pointing, and there I see...[%p]
Several unsavory-looking young men clad in black leather loitering near the apartment building’s entrance.[%p]
Damn! They got here first![%p]
[name]Faris[line]“We can’t get in like this, nya...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s get out of here!”[%p]
We try to cut through Yodobashi and head to Showa-dori, but get caught en route.[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker A[line]“There they are!”[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker B[line]“Text the location!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Damn! How many of them are there!?[%p]
All we can do is turn back.[%p]
We won’t make any progress if we keep running like this.[%p]
We need to find somewhere we can rest.[%p]
The lab. We can manage something if we escape there.[%p]
We need to get there somehow.[%p]
But there are Virals loitering around the lab.[%p]
There’s no way we can get past them.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wheww, whew, haahaahaah...”[%p]
We end up seeking refuge in the ramen shop behind the lab.[%p]
The ramen shop behind the lab.[%p]
On another worldline, this was MayQueen+Nyan², where Faris and Mayuri worked as maids.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Why are we stopping here, nya? We need to run!”[%p]
MayQueen’s second floor now seems to be the storehouse for the ramen shop downstairs.[%p]
...Actually, that might be the perfect place to hide.[%p]
I take Faris’s hand and run up the stairs.[%p]
In the empty room are piles of what seem to be bags of flour.[%p]
Faris and I hide behind one such pile.[%p]
I just hope nobody saw us come in.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s wait here until those assholes give up.”[%p]
I take out my phone and open the compose mail screen.[%p]
I send Daru an SOS.[%p]
“Faris and I are hiding above ’Ramen Tasaburou.’”[%p]
“It’s mostly empty with some sacks of wheat flour.”[%p]
“Nothing that looks useful as a weapon, and nothing big enough to hide behind.”[%p]
“The Viral Attackers are chasing us, and I don’t think they can be reasoned with.”[%p]
“Normally I’d have no trouble taking on all of them, but I can’t use my full strength with Faris nearby.”[%p]
“Call us a taxi, pronto.”[%p]
I send the email.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“--whew”[%p]
It’s hot as hell in here.[%p]
The running has made me thirsty.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Haah, haah... If this were MayQueen, we’d have air conditioning, and I could get something to drink...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, nothing...”[%p]
I just said the first thing that came to mind, but Faris looks at me strangely.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“How do you know the name of the maid cafe that was supposed to open here, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Eh...?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Oh, I know. We opened up the homepage for a little bit to post maid recruiting information, nyan. Did you see it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...It was supposed to open?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris organyaized the cafe’s plans and passed it through the conference. It was almost a done deal, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But at the last moment, Papa put his paw down, and the plan died, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Papa’s such a blockhead, nya...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If he left the store to me, it would’ve been the best maid cafe in all of Japan, with mmhmm costumes and hnngtastic maids, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It would’ve even pulled customers to Akiba from all the way over in Ueno and Ikebukuro. It’s such a waste, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
The Akihabara I know catered to fans of games, anime, and moe culture.[%p]
The current Akihabara is still the electric town of old.[%p]
This used to be the maid cafe, MayQueen+Nyan².[%p]
But now it’s a ramen shop.[%p]
And if I remember correctly, Faris wasn’t this attached to RaiNet AccessBattlers on the previous worldline.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris... no, Akiha Rumiho.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hanyan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re the Akiha daughter and heir, so you go to the Akihabara city development conferences too, right?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nnya? I don’t attend, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You don’t? But didn’t you say that...”[%p]
Did she say that before the worldline changed?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Papa’s the one who goes to the conferences, nya. Why would Faris have to go nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then, why [color index="A0140000"]did[color index="800000"] you go to the conferences?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Like I said, I don’t, nya.”[%p]
That’s right. It makes no sense for a high school girl to participate in development conferences, much less be the mastermind behind the moefication of Akiba.[%p]
Moe shops began to spring up around 2002, didn’t they?[%p]
Back then, Faris was still 9 years old![%p]
Could this be a clue to the contents of Faris’s D-Mail?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your dad’s into retro PCs, right?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Yeah! By the way, we still haven’t found an IBN 5100, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Has your dad ever sold any or given one away?”[%p]
On another worldline, Faris’s dad donated the IBN 5100 to Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
Or was it Faris who did that?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Never, nya. Papa loves all of the PCs he’s collected, nya. He’d never get rid of one, nya.”[%p]
The why did he donate the IBN 5100?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you have any retro PCs, Faris?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I don’t get Papa’s hobby at all, nya. Faris likes cosplay and anime and cute things, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
The reason the moe shops disappeared was because Faris didn’t participate in the city development conferences.[%p]
I guess that’s what the D-Mail was about.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s say you participated in city development ever since you were a child.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’d put moe shops all over Akiba, nya. Just visit ComiMa and you’ll see the wonder of otaku power, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’m sure more people would visit Akiba then, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That aside, if you no longer wanted to participate after participating for all that time...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How would you stop yourself in the past?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Is this some sorta psychological test, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s just a hypothetical question.”[%p]
Faris ponders this for a while.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hm... a dramatic way would be purrfect.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Like you see on TV, nya. Faris is weak to drama, nya. I probably got that from Papa, nyan.”[%p]
Really?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“For example, if Faris got kidnapped or--”[%p]
Suddenly, Faris falls silent.[%p]
It’s a dark room. I can’t read her expression.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kid...napped?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris?”[%p]
What’s wrong?[%p]
Faris suddenly clutches her head.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Ugh...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“My head hurts, nya...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“H-hey, Kyouma... Faris has been feeling funny since coming to this storehouse, nya... Even though I only came here once, back when I was a little kitten...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It feels really... nyastalgic...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Like I’ve been here... many times, nya...”[%p]
What does this mean?[%p]
Is she messing with me again? No, this feels too real.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Ah...”[%p]
Her face lights up.[%p]
And then she grabs my arm.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I... remember...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Remember what?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I remember, nya!”[%p]
The force of her declaration stifles my response.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“MayQueen+Nyan²!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma and Daru-nyan were regular customers, nya. And Mayushii worked here too, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Really? You really remember that?”[%p]
Faris nods.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“And how Kyouma and Daru talked about the time machine at the store, and how I asked to use it in return for helping find an IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“And how later, I convinced Kyouma and Daru-nyan it was weird to compare time to a river.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“And how I took the blood oath to become a lab mem.”[%p]
I’d almost forgotten those things myself.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And the D-Mail? Do you remember what you sent?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...”[%p]
Faris lets out a sigh.[%p]
Her smile suddenly disappears.[%p]
Don’t tell me that’s all she remembers?[%p]
Or was she tricking me again?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I remember, but... you said you have to cancel it, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes. I need to undo the changes made to the past by your D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You can’t, nya!”[%p]
Faris shakes her head violently and presses her body against me again.[%p]
We’re alone in this dim storehouse.[%p]
I can feel her hot breath against my cheek.[%p]
There’s no one here to see us. We’re safe.[%p]
I feel myself getting excited by her proximity.[%p]
No! I need to keep my cool![%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You can’t undo it, nya...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please listen, Faris! Mayuri’s life depends on it!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Eh... Mayushii’s...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If we don’t return the worldline to normal... if I don’t get that IBN 5100, then Mayuri will die.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know it sounds ridiculous, but it’s the truth.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So please. I need to send another D-Mail and cancel the one you--”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“The wish Faris made with her D-Mail...”[%p]
Faris cuts in, as if to silence me.[%p]
Her eyes are wet, reflecting the dim light.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“The wish Faris made...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...was to save Papa, who died ten years ago, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“--!?”[%p]
What...?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I exchanged the past where Papa died, for a past where he didn’t die, nyan.”[%p]
You mean that kind-looking man, her father... died ten years ago?[%p]
That’s consistent with everything, now that I think about it.[%p]
Faris really has remembered her D-Mail.[%p]
Now that I know the result, all I have to do is send the cancellation D-Mail.[%p]
But it’s not so simple.[%p]
I need to cancel the D-Mail that [color index="A0140000"]prevented her father’s death ten years ago[color index="800000"].[%p]
Isn’t that the same as [color index="A0140000"]killing him again[color index="800000"]?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“!?”[%p]
I hear the door open and quickly cover Faris’s mouth with my hand.[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker A[line]“Is Faris really hiding in here?”[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker B[line]“Someone saw two people who looked like them go inside.”[%p]
Crap![%p]
Someone saw us!?[%p]
We need to do something.[%p]
If they call their friends, we’re done for.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
Shit, not now![%p]
The Virals react to the ringtone.[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker A[line]“Where are you!?”[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker B[line]“So you were here, Faris.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okabe! Can you hear me!? We called a taxi, but it’ll take some time to get there.”[%p]
Kurisu...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You exposed us to the pursuers. They’re right in front of us!”[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker A[line]“Hey, come out!”[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker B[line]“There’s no point in hiding!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“I see. Then I’ll lecture you on how to escape. You’re in the same the place you were before, right?”[%p]
The men are approaching our hiding spot. But because the room is dark, it seems they can’t tell where we are.[%p]
I listen carefully to Kurisu’s voice.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Scatter the flour and make a break for it. OK?”[%p]
Scatter the flour?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Then switch on the light.”[%p]
Now I get it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Roger. Over and out.”[%p]
Then, I see the light reflect off of something.[%p]
One of the men has a butterfly knife. He opens the blade with a flourish.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“!?”[%p]
I quickly rip open a nearby wheat flour sack and toss its contents into the air.[%p]
The scattered white powder shines in the sunlight through the window.[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker A[line]“What the hell!?”[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker B[line]“I can’t see! Cough cough!”[%p]
Slipping past the disoriented men, I carry Faris towards the exit.[%p]
Right next to the exit, I see the light switch.[%p]
I push Faris out first, then flip the switch right before shutting the door.[%p]
Right as we get out--[%p]
A sound like firecrackers resounds from the other side of the door.[%p]
A dust explosion.[%p]
I’ve seen this same trick used by guys like MacDyver and [color index="820000"]Master Cheaton[color index="800000"].[%p]
That should distract them long enough for us to escape![%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Khohkhoh, khohkhohkhoh!”[%p]
Faris coughs, shaking wheat flour off of her clothes and hair.[%p]
But there’s no time to spare.[%p]
The taxi still isn’t here.[%p]
But it’s not like we can wait for it.[%p]
We need to leave here now![%p]
I press the End Call button and shove the phone into my pocket.[%p]
But it’s too late.[%p]
They already heard it.[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker A[line]“Hey, we found you!”[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker B[line]“Hehhehhe! You can’t escape!”[%p]
With brass knuckles in hand, one of the men starts grinning, baring his canines.[%p]
We’re suddenly driven to the wall.[%p]
Dammit! Is this the end!?[%p]
It’s over. We’re done for.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Oh no! 4℃ got run over by a car, nya!”[%p]
Faris shouts and points to the window.[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker A[line]“Wh-what!? 4℃-san!?”[%p]
Faris rushes recklessly at the bewildered men--[%p]
Or so I thought, but she actually just slips between them.[%p]
I follow.[%p]
We race down the stairs at a breakneck pace.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nice feint, Faris!”[%p]
However...[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker C[line]“You’re not getting away!”[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker D[line]“Get them!”[%p]
Crap![%p]
We were headed for the lab, but got ambushed.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Oh no...”[%p]
Soon, Faris and I are surrounded by men with the fires of hatred burning in their eyes.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Yo! We got you now.”[%p]
The crowd parts down the middle, and 4℃ steps forward, wearing a hat.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“I’ll tell ya one thing. You can’t escape my totally bad black aura.”[%p]
I shield Faris with my body.[%p]
4℃ cracks his knuckles and smiles.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“I always fight the system. And once again, my elegant evil story ends in perfect victory.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stop. Don’t you lay a finger on me.”[%p]
The only thing I can do to stop faltering is to go into Hououin Kyouma mode.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you take another step, the power in my right arm... will break free!”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Always at the front line of the scene stands one man. That one man, is the peacock flapping its black wings.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gwaaaaah! Calm down, right arm of mine! No! The seal is... coming undone! Run away, all of you! Your lives are in jeopardy!”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“I’ll elegantly floor you with my crazy dance. The one chosen by the jet black wings is none other than I.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No... my right hand... my right haaaaand! Please, stop! I don’t want to kill any moooore!”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Hey, what the hell is he doing?”[%p]
Something strikes the top of my head.[%p]
One of the Virals threw a can at me.[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker C[line]“Don’t let him trick you! He’s just a textbook chuunibyou case!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, like you guys can talk.”[%p]
[name]Viral Attacker D[line]“Whatever! Just kick his ass!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Very well... then prepare yourselves! Releasing restriction si--”[%p]
Before I can finish, 4℃ kicks me in the solar plexus.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gweh...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma!”[%p]
He grabs the top of my head and knees me repeatedly.[%p]
Finally, he lets go of my hair. I start coughing as soon as I hit the ground.[%p]
Next, 4℃ lays into me with heavy kicks to the head and body. I raise my arms to protect my face.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Heh! I told you, man! The coldest ice burns!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s frostbite, you idiot--”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Why you!”[%p]
He starts stomping on me with his booted heels.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma!”[%p]
All I can feel is pain.[%p]
I abandon all thought and wait for the storm to pass.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Stop it, nya! Don’t hurt Kyouma any more!”[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“Don’t tell me what to do! I only listen to the whispers of Gaia!”[%p]
4℃ grabs my thumb in both hands. Then, he starts to twist.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Stop it! Someone, help!”[%p]
I hear a sound.[%p]
A car’s exhaust.[%p]
The honking of a horn.[%p]
A limousine barrels into the alleyway at terrific speed.[%p]
Everyone screams and scatters to avoid it.[%p]
The smell of burnt rubber.[%p]
Tire tracks on the asphalt. The limousine stops right in front my fallen body.[%p]
The back door opens.[%p]
[name]Faris’s Dad[line]“Get inside!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“P-Papa!”[%p]
But I can’t even stand up.[%p]
There’s no strength in my body left.[%p]
My vision’s blurry, too.[%p]
Slender arms wrap around my body, pulling me towards the car.[%p]
The soft scent of citrus tickles my nose.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hang in there, nya!”[%p]
I let her help me into the limousine.[%p]
[name]4℃[line]“W-wait! You’re not getting away!”[%p]
The door shuts, cutting off his shouting.[%p]
The car speeds off like a bullet.[%p]
