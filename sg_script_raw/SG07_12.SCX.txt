There’s a softness under my head.[%p]
We’re inside the limousine. My head is resting on Faris’s lap.[%p]
Every inch of my body feels like it’s on fire.[%p]
And at the same time, there’s a terrible cold in my bones.[%p]
I can barely hear. My ears are ringing.[%p]
The urge to vomit has receded, at least.[%p]
They really messed me up.[%p]
According to Faris’s dad, he was racing to UPX to congratulate Faris when he saw us.[%p]
A fortunate coincidence, indeed.[%p]
Is this also the choice of Steins Gate?[%p]
[name]Faris’s Dad[line]“I really need to thank you, Okabe-kun. Thank you for protecting my daughter.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“P-protecting...?”[%p]
I’m no hero.[%p]
If I had the strength, I would prostrate myself right now before this man.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I wasn’t able to do anything against those guys. I was pathetic...”[%p]
[name]Faris’s Dad[line]“Absolutely not. You saved my daughter’s life.”[%p]
He shakes my hand firmly in gratitude.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Oh, Papa... I thought I told you not to push yourself since you’ve got important work to do. You should listen to me, nya.”[%p]
Faris looks happy as she says that.[%p]
However...[%p]
I recall what Faris told me in the ramen shop.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“The wish Faris made...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...was to save Papa, who died ten years ago, nya.”[%p]
If that’s true, then to return to the original worldline, I have to erase her father. To kill him, essentially.[%p]
[name]Faris’s Dad[line]“I always keep my promises to you, Rumiho.”[%p]
[name]Faris’s Dad[line]“I made that decision long ago.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Papa... thank you, nya.”[%p]
The limousine soon reaches Faris’s home.[%p]
[name]Faris’s Dad[line]“So you’re looking for an IBN 5100?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s right. I heard you were an enthusiastic retro PC collector. Do you know anything about it?”[%p]
I end up eating dinner at Faris’s apartment.[%p]
Faris’s father was extremely grateful to me and invited me up.[%p]
I would’ve been okay with just borrowing the shower, but he even prepared a change of clothes for me. And he even told me I could stay since it’s still too dangerous to go outside.[%p]
During the meal, I try asking about the IBN 5100, ignoring the pain I still feel throughout my body.[%p]
[name]Faris’s Dad[line]“It’s quite unusual for a man your age to know about the IBN 5100.”[%p]
He smiles when I bring up his hobby of collecting old PCs.[%p]
[name]Faris’s Dad[line]“I did have one. I gave it away, though.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You... gave it away?”[%p]
[name]Faris’s Dad[line]“Yes. I had a compelling reason.”[%p]
He glances at his daughter.[%p]
Faris keeps eating her meal silently.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you donate it to Yanabayashi Shrine?”[%p]
[name]Faris’s Dad[line]“To a shrine? No...”[%p]
No?[%p]
All the strength drains from my body. Were my efforts for nothing?[%p]
[name]Faris’s Dad[line]“I don’t think Hashida-san, who entrusted the IBN 5100 to me, could ever forgive me for what I did...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hashida? As in Hashida Suzu?”[%p]
Faris’s dad nods.[%p]
Suzuha’s pseudonym. My pulse rises instantly upon hearing that name.[%p]
She did it. She found an IBN 5100.[%p]
She brought it to Akiba.[%p]
She completed her mission.[%p]
Tears well up in my eyes. I bite them back.[%p]
[name]Faris’s Dad[line]“This is an old story... a story from before my company got as big as it is.”[%p]
[name]Faris’s Dad[line]“Rumiho was kidnapped. The kidnapper demanded an unthinkable ransom.”[%p]
[name]Faris’s Dad[line]“Maybe I should have mortgaged the company instead.”[%p]
[name]Faris’s Dad[line]“But at that moment, someone appeared, like a godsend, offering a large sum of money to buy my IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Faris’s Dad[line]“I sold it, which gave me enough to prepare Rumiho’s ransom.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Let’s not talk about that, nya...”[%p]
For some reason, Faris’s face turns red with embarrassment.[%p]
If I had to say, her dad seems really happy to tell this story.[%p]
Not something you’d expect from a kidnapping story.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So who was the buyer?”[%p]
[name]Faris’s Dad[line]“Hmm, a French businessman, I believe. I think I still have his contact information. Would you like it?”[%p]
I politely decline the offer.[%p]
There’s no way the IBN 5100 will arrive from France in time. And I doubt we could afford to pay for it anyway.[%p]
Plus, there’s a high possibility the buyer is related to SERN, or to the Rounders.[%p]
I clench my fist, then open it again.[%p]
Why won’t you return to me, IBN 5100!?[%p]
