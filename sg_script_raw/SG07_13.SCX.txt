[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
It’s well past midnight, and I’m still awake.[%p]
My body hurts too much to sleep. And then there’s the question eating at my mind.[%p]
What should I do?[%p]
How can I cancel the D-Mail that saved Faris’s father?[%p]
My encounter with the man himself has given birth to unnecessary internal conflict.[%p]
I’m about to steal Faris’s father away from her.[%p]
I need to do it to save Mayuri.[%p]
But does that give me the right to play God?[%p]
I hear a knock, and then the door opens.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, Faris. Still awake?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“May I come in?”[%p]
Hm?[%p]
Normally, Faris would have added “nya” to the end of that question.[%p]
Without waiting for my answer, Faris steps inside.[%p]
Then she sits next to me on the bed.[%p]
She’s not wearing her cat ears.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...Um. Thanks for earlier.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“When the Viral gang started chasing me, I was really scared.”[%p]
Does she have a fever or something?[%p]
Why is she talking normally?[%p]
She usually pretends to be a catgirl. Does this mean she’s not using her Faris persona right now?[%p]
Is this the real Akiha Rumiho? [%p]
It’s actually refreshing to hear Faris talk normally like this.[%p]
It excites me for some reason. Like she’s showing me a side of herself that no one has ever seen.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“That was the first time I ever felt such black emotion from a huge crowd of people.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Those guys were obsessed with black.”[%p]
She slaps me on the knee lightly.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Come on. I’m trying to be serious.”[%p]
Wh-what? Even her retort is normal.[%p]
The person sitting in front of me isn’t a cat-eared maid, and she isn’t the RaiNet Champion.[%p]
She’s just a normal girl...[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Does it still hurt?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, I’m fine.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma... I mean, Okabe-san. I don’t know what would’ve happened if you hadn’t been there. I shiver just thinking about it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t correct yourself like that. Just call me what you usually do.”[%p]
Faris sighs.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Anyway, Kyouma, I can’t thank you enough. Thank you, honestly...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You know, Kyouma... You’re my prince.”[%p]
Prince? What’s with the fairy tale talk?[%p]
She’s giving me goosebumps.[%p]
T-this calls for Hououin Kyouma![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am not a prince! I am an insane mad scientist and--”[%p]
Before I finish, Faris throws herself on top of me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!?”[%p]
She wraps her arms around me tightly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“F-Faris...?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I want you to call me Rumiho.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, Faris is Faris, remember?”[%p]
T-this is bad.[%p]
What should I do!?[%p]
What does Faris want!?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hey... I think it’s time to end this.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You went back in time, and risked your life to save me.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So, I want to grant your wish too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But...”[%p]
I swallow the rest of my words.[%p]
Granting my wish would mean erasing her father’s existence.[%p]
My heart aches.[%p]
It was like this with Suzuha, too.[%p]
I erased everything that Suzuha had shared with us in 2010, including her memories of meeting her father.[%p]
I did it for the sake of my personal goal, to save Mayuri.[%p]
Must I once again sacrifice someone else’s dream?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It was on my eighth birthday.”[%p]
Still clinging to me, Faris looks down and begins her story.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I wanted Papa to take a break from work so he could spend time with me.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Papa’s company wasn’t as big back then, so he worked every day, from morning to night. I never got to see him.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“The present I wanted most was for him to spend one whole day with me.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“And Papa promised. He promised he’d spend the entire day with me, no matter what.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Something came up, and he had to break his promise the day before.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I was so afraid that Papa didn’t really love me.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So on my birthday, I ran away from home. I wanted to make Papa worry.”[%p]
Faris pauses here for a time.[%p]
Then she looks up at me and continues with tears in her eyes.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...The plane Papa was on made a bad landing.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Only one person died in the accident. Everyone else was unharmed.”[%p]
Don’t tell me...[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“The one casualty... was Papa...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
That was before the worldline changed.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I couldn’t believe the world would be so cruel to me.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“’I hate you, Papa! You should just die!’”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Those were the last words I ever said to him.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...And that’s how our relationship ended, forever.”[%p]
I can hear the tears in her voice.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I loved him... so why? Why did I say those things to him? I always felt guilty because of what I said.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I always wished I could go back in time... change what happened.”[%p]
Then... did fate guide us to each other?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“When I heard you talking about your time machine, I thought I was being given a chance.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris... Rumiho. That’s enough for today. You don’t have to say anything more.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“No. Let me finish.”[%p]
Faris doesn’t let go of me.[%p]
She sniffles and wipes away her tears, putting on a smile.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’m okay now. Papa came to save me... so I know how much he really loves me.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I really enjoyed having this time to spend with him. It was like a gift to us from heaven.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But now you need to change things back to the way they were.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Mayushii’s a very important friend to me. If Mayushii’s in danger, I’ll do anything to save her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I’m sorry.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Weren’t you listening? This current reality isn’t reality at all, but rather, a gift to my father and me.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Or maybe I should call it a dream. Papa doesn’t belong in this time. You’re just turning things back to normal.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Thank you for letting me have this dream, Kyouma.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you... really okay with that?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...”[%p]
Faris buries her face into my chest.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“A-actually... I’m not okay at all...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I remember how things were before the world changed...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But I also remember how everything was after the world changed, you know?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’m actually kind of freaking out right now.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“What happened before the change and after the change are all mixed up inside me. I don’t know which one is real anymore.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But if I try to fight it, it’ll just make you sad, won’t it?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I don’t want to make you sad. You are my prince, after all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We can do something! There might be a world where you don’t lose your dad [color index="A0140000"]and[color index="800000"] Mayuri doesn’t die! If we try--”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It’s okay. I’ve accepted it.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I don’t want to run away anymore.”[%p]
There’s nothing I can say to that.[%p]
So instead, I tightly embrace her slender body.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Thank you.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hey, is it okay if I cry a little? Before we change things back, is it okay... if I cry for Papa?”[%p]
She’s already crying... but I don’t say anything.[%p]
Instead, I silently nod.[%p]
Faris’s body trembles with emotion as I hold her.[%p]
Her father is sleeping in the room next door, so she probably doesn’t want him to hear. She cries into my chest, muffling her sobs.[%p]
It’s almost noon.[%p]
I feel dizzy.[%p]
It’s like my brain is rusty. My whole body is heavy with fatigue.[%p]
The pain from my wounds has subsided, thankfully, but in the end, I couldn’t sleep a wink.[%p]
I promised Faris that we’d commence the operation at noon.[%p]
Until then, we wait at Faris’s apartment.[%p]
I’ve already contacted Daru and the others back at the lab.[%p]
I told them we’d be performing an experiment today.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris...”[%p]
I can see the traces of tears on her face. The sight makes my heart ache.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’ll go say my last goodbyes to Papa now, nyan.”[%p]
Oh?[%p]
Her usual speaking habits returned the second she donned her cat ears.[%p]
What a nifty piece of equipment.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Let me be alone with Papa for a while, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Maybe I should say “Wait.”[%p]
Maybe I should say “Sorry.”[%p]
But I say nothing to Faris’s back as she heads to her father’s study.[%p]
By the time Faris finishes her farewells with her father and comes out of the study, the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s settings are already complete.[%p]
I contact Daru at the lab and make sure the Braun Tube Workshop’s 42-inch CRT is turned on.[%p]
Now all we have to do is send the D-Mail.[%p]
But I hesitate.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...”[%p]
Instead of meeting Faris’s eyes, I look down at my feet.[%p]
Eternal separation from her father...[%p]
I wonder what Faris is thinking now.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Don’t be like that, Kyouma. You’ve done nothing wrong, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“NyanNyan♪ No more talking, nyan!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Okay.”[%p]
I can’t stay sad when Faris is trying to cheer me up.[%p]
I steel myself for what I need to do.[%p]
Yesterday, just before she left the room, Faris told me the contents of the first D-Mail she sent.[%p]
“100 mil for your kid. Take the train”[%p]
That mail stopped her father from getting on the airplane.[%p]
As a result, he didn’t die.[%p]
But that wasn’t the only effect it had on the timeline.[%p]
Her father needed to sell the IBN 5100 to prepare the hundred million yen ransom.[%p]
As a result, Faris never donated the IBN 5100 to Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
With her father alive, Faris didn’t participate in Akihabara’s city development conferences. Otaku-oriented businesses never took root in Akiba.[%p]
MayQueen+Nyan² never opened.[%p]
Faris wasn’t as busy, which allowed her to join the RaiNet tournament circuit.[%p]
In other words, this worldline’s Faris has a normal life.[%p]
On the worldline I came from, Faris was not only a student, but also the heir to her father’s company, an influential member of the Akihabara development board, and a part-time maid waitress.[%p]
Which life is better for her?[%p]
Which will give her greater happiness?[%p]
That’s not my decision. It’s hers.[%p]
And her decision is to return to the way things were.[%p]
I’m just here to help her wake up from this dream.[%p]
Faris has already entered the cancellation D-Mail.[%p]
“JK on ransom”[%p]
“I luv u papa”[%p]
“See you soon”[%p]
These are Faris’s true last words to her father.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Um... when we change things back, will my memories of this world disappear, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Of course not. You’ll remember.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You have memories from both worlds right now, don’t you?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Is that why you were so desperate to help Faris, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s... open to your interpretation.”[%p]
I feel my cheeks get warm, so I hang my head to hide my face.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Doesn’t want to forget her time with Kyouma, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Thank you.”[%p]
I take Faris’s phone.[%p]
I’m sorry, Faris. I lied to you.[%p]
When we change things back to the way they were, your memories of this worldline will almost certainly disappear.[%p]
Perhaps another miracle will happen, and you’ll regain your memories of this worldline, too. But I can’t be sure. There are no guarantees.[%p]
And so, I will engrave these memories onto my heart.[%p]
The memory of Faris, the RaiNet Champion.[%p]
The memory of her father, who gave thanks to a stranger like me for protecting his daughter.[%p]
I will carry them for you. Always.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Bye bye... Papa.”[%p]
It must be done.[%p]
For Mayuri’s sake.[%p]
I must erase Faris’s memories just as I did Suzuha’s.[%p]
There’s... no other way.[%p]
I give Faris back her phone.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma...?”[%p]
No.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I won’t let this dream end yet.”[%p]
Don’t jump to conclusions.[%p]
We should explore other methods.[%p]
After all, her father’s life hangs in the balance.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s try another way.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I... can’t kill your dad.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’m sorry, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris led you astray, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, it’s okay. This is my decision.”[%p]
I don’t have what it takes to be a god.[%p]
That burden is too much for me to bear.[%p]
