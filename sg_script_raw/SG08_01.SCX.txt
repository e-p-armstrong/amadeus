My head spins. I feel faint.[%p]
Slowly, the world reasserts itself.[%p]
I have teleported to the lab development room.[%p]
Faris is standing next to me.[%p]
Reading Steiner is telling me that the worldline has changed.[%p]
Additionally, the injuries the Viral Attackers inflicted on my body have vanished. So has the pain.[%p]
Faris is standing in the center of the room, looking around.[%p]
The tears that were in her eyes just a moment ago are gone.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma? Do you know where Faris’s phone went, nya?”[%p]
Just a moment ago, Faris was fighting to hold back her tears. But that Faris is no more.[%p]
In her place is the usual cute, cheerful Faris, with an impish smile on her face.[%p]
I look at the phone in my hand.[%p]
It’s not my phone, but one with several cute, girly cat doll phone straps attached.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Here’s your phone.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nya?”[%p]
Faris walks up to me with a teasing smile on her face.[%p]
She pokes at my fingers with her index finger.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma... did you see what was inside, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Faris gently takes her phone from my hand.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If you did see it, then please forget about it, nya. Can’t let that cat out of the bag, nya. Or else [color index="A0140000"]they[color index="800000"] will awaken, nya...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Come on, Kyouma! You’re supposed to say something, nya! Like ’who the hell are they!?’ or something, nya!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I’m sorry.”[%p]
Before we sent the D-Mail, Faris said she didn’t want to forget.[%p]
And I lied that she would surely remember.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma’s acting weird, nya. You usually act all pompous and--nya!?”[%p]
I embrace Faris suddenly, pulling her to me as tightly as I can.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry.”[%p]
Faris remembers nothing.[%p]
Nothing about her victory at the RaiNet tournament.[%p]
Nothing about our escape from the Viral Attackers.[%p]
Nothing about her father riding up in his limousine to save her.[%p]
Nothing about how we talked alone in her bedroom.[%p]
Nothing. She remembers nothing.[%p]
Everything that happened on that worldline was undone.[%p]
What happens to that worldline, I don’t know.[%p]
Maybe, like Suzuha said, it still exists as another possible worldline.[%p]
Or maybe it ceased to exist the moment I sent the D-Mail.[%p]
You’d have to be a god to observe each and every worldline, so it’s pointless to worry about it.[%p]
But one thing is clear.[%p]
I can never return to that worldline again.[%p]
Faris can never see her father again.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma? T-this is really bold of you, nya... Mayushii’s in the next room. She’ll find out, you know? Nyahaha...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry...”[%p]
The only thing I can do is apologize.[%p]
On this worldline, Mayuri invited Faris to come hang out at the lab.[%p]
Apparently, she came to see a costume Mayuri had made.[%p]
Faris has work after this, so she soon leaves the lab.[%p]
After seeing Faris off, I head towards Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
On the way, I stop at Chuo-dori and take a look around.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They’re back...”[%p]
The moe stores exist again.[%p]
Animate, Toranoana, Mandarake, Gamers, Lammtarra, Melon Books, Asobit City...[%p]
They’ve all returned to the streets of Akiba.[%p]
There’s a gigantic anime-themed banner hanging from the Sofmap building.[%p]
Maids walk the street, handing out leaflets.[%p]
Cosplaying girls advertise in storefronts.[%p]
But the return of this familiar scenery brings no relief to my heart.[%p]
There is only pain, for everything I see confirms that Faris has lost her father.[%p]
But I can’t stop here.[%p]
I shake my head and hurry to the shrine.[%p]
On the way, I notice that the satellite is missing from Radi-Kan’s rooftop.[%p]
Of course it is. Suzuha is gone.[%p]
The thought brings a new pang of grief to my heart.[%p]
Before this is over, how much more pain will I shoulder?[%p]
