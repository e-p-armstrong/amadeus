I pass beneath the archway and enter the silent courtyard.[%p]
I walk up to the main building and jab the intercom.[%p]
After a few presses, I get a reply.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yes, who is... ah, Okabe-san.”[%p]
Lukako comes out.[%p]
Girly as always, even though he’s a guy.[%p]
No, wait. This Lukako is a genuine girl.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako, someone should have donated an old computer to the shrine several years ago. Can you ask your dad about it for me?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“An... old computer?”[%p]
Hm? I think Lukako went pale when I mentioned the computer.[%p]
She lowers her face immediately, so I can’t be certain.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um, I’ll go call my dad.”[%p]
Lukako hurries inside.[%p]
It looks like she knows something...[%p]
Lukako’s dad soon appears.[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Well, if it isn’t Hououin-kun. Thank you for taking care of my daughter.”[%p]
I rush the greeting and get down to business.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If I’m not mistaken, there was an old computer donated to this shrine about ten years ago. Do you know about it?”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“An old computer... why, yes, I do remember that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Really!?”[%p]
Yes! Finally, I’ve returned to the worldline with the IBN 5100![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please, I need to see it!”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Sure. Please wait here.”[%p]
Luka’s dad heads inside the sanctuary in the back.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Lukako has been silent this whole time.[%p]
She keeps touching her hair and looking around nervously. Something is definitely wrong with her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you afraid of me, Lukako?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I understand. I mean, I uh... touched your, uh, naughty bits, I guess...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
Crap, I just made things more awkward![%p]
I didn’t have to say it like that![%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m not... afraid of you, Okabe-san...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“That was really... embarrassing, though...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okay...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By the way, do you know about the IBN 5100?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“N-no!”[%p]
Lukako shakes her head in an unnatural way.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’ve... never heard of it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But when I called you before, it sounded like you knew about it.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“No, I...”[%p]
Lukako is looking more and more uncomfortable.[%p]
Maybe I’m pushing her too hard. I should back off.[%p]
I did a terrible thing to this girl.[%p]
So it might be best if I stop treating her as my disciple.[%p]
I need to treat her like a lady from now on.[%p]
If I don’t, I could get sued for sexual harassment or charged with attempted rape or indecency or something.[%p]
But how exactly do I treat her like a lady anyway?[%p]
I just treat everyone the same, pretty much.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, uh... you’re not gonna wear the costume Mayuri made?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Oh... no...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Because it’s embarrassing?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yes...”[%p]
Why is this girl so lacking in confidence?[%p]
I guess she can’t help it if it’s in her nature.[%p]
But didn’t she say her reason for becoming a girl was to gain confidence in the first place?[%p]
And yet, she’s a girl now, but she still seems the same inside.[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“That’s strange...”[%p]
Luka’s dad returns.[%p]
His timing is good. My conversation with Lukako wasn’t going anywhere.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you find it?”[%p]
I try asking just in case, but he looks confused. Obviously something unexpected has happened.[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Well... I couldn’t find it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You couldn’t find it?”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“I remember receiving an old computer, but it’s not in the storehouse anymore.”[%p]
The IBN 5100 isn’t here?[%p]
I press my hands to my temples and stifle a groan.[%p]
The worldline is still twisted.[%p]
The IBN 5100 is like a mirage floating in front of me. I can see it but never reach it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Pardon my asking, but the PC was donated by Akiha Rumiho-san, correct?”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Huh, how did you know? Do you know her by chance?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’re friends.”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Rumiho-chan has grown up to be a splendid young lady, hasn’t she?”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“It was when she was still in elementary school. She came to visit with her butler, Kuroki-san.”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“But why did that computer disappear? I thought someone might have stolen it, but everything else is untouched, and the lock wasn’t broken.”[%p]
This contradicts Lukako’s statement.[%p]
Lukako said she didn’t know about the IBN 5100.[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“Luka, do you know anything about it? You’ve been cleaning the sanctuary the past few years, haven’t you?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
Once again, Lukako hangs her head, almost shaking with fear.[%p]
Her hands are trembling.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako, what’s wrong?”[%p]
I try asking again.[%p]
But she doesn’t raise her head.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...I don’t know anything.”[%p]
The look on her face betrays her.[%p]
Lukako is lying.[%p]
But why?[%p]
Remember. She shouldn’t even know about the IBN 5100.[%p]
Why does she know?[%p]
Because the worldline changed. There’s no other answer.[%p]
Her D-Mail must be the cause.[%p]
In Faris’s case, I didn’t know what her D-Mail was about.[%p]
But in Lukako’s case, I already know what it is.[%p]
“I want to be a girl.”[%p]
The D-Mail must have had influence beyond Lukako’s sex. The Butterfly Effect.[%p]
It somehow changed the location of the IBN 5100.[%p]
It was like that with Suzuha, and with Faris.[%p]
I can’t help but think that the universe itself is keeping the IBN 5100 away from me.[%p]
At any rate, when Lukako sent her D-Mail, Reading Steiner activated. Meaning the D-Mail changed the worldline.[%p]
If the IBN 5100 won’t return to me on this worldline, then my next step is to cancel Lukako’s D-Mail.[%p]
In other words, I need to turn Lukako back into a guy.[%p]
Suddenly, I feel dizzy. It’s not heatstroke, and it’s not Reading Steiner.[%p]
How am I going to explain this to Lukako herself?[%p]
Just the other day, when I called Lukako a guy, she cried. Then Kurisu and Mayuri ganged up on me.[%p]
Can I get Lukako to go back to being a guy without stirring up trouble?[%p]
This is going to be tough.[%p]
Maybe I should consult someone about this.[%p]
At first, I consider consulting Kurisu, but I don’t think I should talk to a girl this time.[%p]
Let’s think a little...[%p]
I visit Tennouji’s house.[%p]
The divergence meter is here. I need to know what it says.[%p]
Canceling Faris’s D-Mail appears to have raised the value by about 0.05%.[%p]
Little by little, I’m approaching the goal of 1% divergence.[%p]
The number gives me courage.[%p]
Afterwards, Tennouji recounts his memories of Hashida Suzu, just as he did on a previous worldline. I stay until he’s finished.[%p]
