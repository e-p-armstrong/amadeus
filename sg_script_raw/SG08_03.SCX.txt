It’s past 6 PM when I get back to the lab.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪ Welcome backarin.”[%p]
There are two girls in the lab -- Mayuri and Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who is this ’Karin’?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Well, ’welcome back’ flows so well into ’Okarin,’ doesn’t it? When you put them together, it’s doubly delicious.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not delicious.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s a greeting I can only use for Okarin, so why not? Ehehe!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where’s Daru?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hmm, probably at MayQueen?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“MayQueen...”[%p]
So that’s back too.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So when Faris said she had work, she meant at MayQueen...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What about you, Mayuri? You work there too, don’t you?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“’Course I do! You know that, Okarin. You’re so weird!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s taking a break to prepare for ComiMa tomorrow.”[%p]
The timeline has been corrected, it seems. At least in part.[%p]
I should stop by MayQueen when I have time.[%p]
I’ll visit sometime when Mayuri and Faris are working.[%p]
I didn’t realize it until it was gone, but I think I really like that maid cafe.[%p]
Kurisu’s reading a western book.[%p]
It’s the same book as always. It’s pretty hefty, so it must take a long time to read.[%p]
I walk past her and enter the development room.[%p]
There sits the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
Today is Saturday, the 14th of August.[%p]
The first time Mayuri died, it happened on Friday the 13th.[%p]
After Suzuha’s sacrifice changed the worldline, Mayuri died on the 14th instead. Her death was delayed 24 hours exactly.[%p]
If that pattern continues, her death on this worldline should occur tomorrow, the 15th.[%p]
Just to be safe, I should buy a few days with the Time Leap Machine. I’ll need time to solve the Lukako problem.[%p]
I should time leap right away.[%p]
Just before entering the lab, I peeked into the Braun Tube Workshop. The 42-inch CRT was on, so there’s no problem there.[%p]
Still...[%p]
Will Mayuri really die on the 15th?[%p]
I don’t have solid proof.[%p]
Maybe there is no pattern, and it’s just in my head.[%p]
Maybe Mayuri dies today.[%p]
Maybe she dies tomorrow.[%p]
What I want more than anything is for that never to happen.[%p]
What happens to Mayuri on this worldline?[%p]
I mustn’t let my guard down. Not until the IBN 5100 is back in my possession.[%p]
At the same time, however, I want to know what happens to Mayuri on this worldline.[%p]
There’s still a chance, however small, that she won’t die.[%p]
No, don’t hesitate![%p]
Hesitation could lead to an irreparable mistake.[%p]
I don’t want to see Mayuri die again. To see the light fade from her eyes.[%p]
It’s too painful.[%p]
So I won’t confirm Mayuri’s death. I don’t want to.[%p]
All I can do is assume the worst.[%p]
Retrieving the IBN 5100 is the only sure way to prevent her death.[%p]
I must not rest until then.[%p]
I need to time leap now.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe? What are you doing? I thought we weren’t going to--”[%p]
By the time Kurisu starts talking, the discharge phenomenon has already started.[%p]
An unpleasant sound pierces my ears.[%p]
My vision ripples. My flesh and my soul momentarily feel separate.[%p]
I grab my right wrist. I close my eyes, take deep breaths, and wait for my pulse to return to normal.[%p]
I took two time leaps, traveling a total of 57 hours into the past.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whew...”[%p]
The worst is over. All that’s left is a headache.[%p]
I need to cancel Lukako’s D-Mail on this worldline.[%p]
I sit down in a pipe chair and try to come up with a plan.[%p]
...I can always time leap later.[%p]
I put away my phone and take a deep breath.[%p]
I don’t want to sacrifice anyone else.[%p]
I know it’s unreasonable, but I want to hope that nothing will happen on this worldline.[%p]
A foolish dream, perhaps... but still.[%p]
Nothing happens on the 14th.[%p]
Moeka’s group doesn’t appear at the lab, and Mayuri doesn’t get involved in any accidents.[%p]
So far, so good.[%p]
The problem is tomorrow.[%p]
The time is 7:30 PM.[%p]
My preparations are complete.[%p]
The Time Leap Machine is set, Moad Snake is primed, and the remote control for the TV downstairs is ready.[%p]
It’s all second nature to me now.[%p]
ComiMa started today, so Mayuri’s been in Ariake since this morning.[%p]
I told Daru not to come to the lab today, but to keep an eye on Mayuri instead.[%p]
So even if Moeka’s group shows up here, they have a low chance of killing Mayuri.[%p]
Will the Rounders come on this worldline?[%p]
We’ll soon find out.[%p]
7:35.[%p]
The door isn’t kicked open.[%p]
Instead...[%p]
My phone rings. It’s Daru.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hello? Daru?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“Haa, ugh, gh, haah...”[%p]
Something’s wrong.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, what happened!? Daru!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“I’m sor... some guys... came out of nowhere... they took Mayu-shi...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“I think... they wanted... me...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“I... ran... but Mayu-shi...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line][color index="8A0000"]“What do I do, Okarin!?”[%p]
It’s the Rounders. They kidnapped her.[%p]
And then they probably killed her.[%p]
To them, Mayuri is [color index="A0140000"]expendable[color index="800000"].[%p]
I grind my teeth in frustration.[%p]
It didn’t work. I still haven’t averted Mayuri’s death.[%p]
I toss Moad Snake onto the couch.[%p]
The preparations were a waste. Mayuri died somewhere else.[%p]
I hang up and walk to the development room.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I won’t let you kill Mayuri!”[%p]
And so, once more, I send my memories to the past.[%p]
An unpleasant sound pierces my ears.[%p]
My vision ripples. My flesh and my soul momentarily feel separate.[%p]
I grab my right wrist. I close my eyes, take deep breaths, and wait for my pulse to return to normal.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whew...”[%p]
The worst is over. All that’s left is a headache.[%p]
Now I have my answer.[%p]
Mayuri’s death is still fixed, just as in my heart I knew it would be. The change merely delayed it by another 24 hours.[%p]
I need to cancel Lukako’s D-Mail.[%p]
I sit down in a pipe chair and try to come up with a plan.[%p]
