Nothing.[%p]
I’ve been searching for a way to tell Lukako the truth, but every mental simulation I run ends with her in tears.[%p]
I suppose that’s to be expected.[%p]
After all, I’ve already seen it happen once.[%p]
I mistook Lukako for a guy, and she ended up in tears.[%p]
I mean, Lukako cries at just about anything...[%p]
To broach the topic now would be like poking an open wound.[%p]
Damn. It looks like I have no choice but to ask Kurisu.[%p]
She’s a girl, so she should understand how Lukako feels.[%p]
I call Kurisu out to the bench in front of the Braun Tube Workshop. We’re alone.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This seems serious.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes. I have a difficult problem that requires... delicacy to resolve.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Delicacy? That’s like the exact opposite of what anyone expects from you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s why I want to ask a girl. Plus, you’re my assistant, so I need you to save my [color index="A0140000"]ass[color index="800000"] this [color index="A0140000"]instant[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh, you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why do you need to ask a girl anyway?”[%p]
I give her the rundown -- including how many times I’ve time leaped, and what happened with Suzuha and Faris.[%p]
How many times have I explained this to her now?[%p]
This time, she believes me more readily than I expected.[%p]
The only thing she doesn’t believe is the story about Lukako.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Urushibara-san is actually a guy? That’s totally ridiculous.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But it’s the truth. Was the truth.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So basically, umm...”[%p]
She wrinkles her brow in thought.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“She looked like Hashida?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Crap, I got a mental image there for a second.[%p]
Judging by her expression, so did Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Rintaro & Kurisu[line][center]”Ugh.”[%p]
We grimace.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Unacceptable! There’s no way such a cute girl was a guy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, hold your horses. I never said that Lukako looked like a guy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“He actually looked pretty much the same. He was always androgynous, so much you couldn’t help but think he was secreting excess female hormones or something.”[%p]
As a result, I didn’t even notice when Lukako became a girl at first, and made a fatal mistake.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“He looked like she does now?”[%p]
Kurisu’s gaze wanders for bit...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Acceptable.”[%p]
What?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway. You want to turn her back into a guy?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Unless we do, Mayuri dies.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Mayuri’s life is tied to Urushibara-san’s gender... That’s so crazy it doesn’t seem real at all.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Have you come up with a solution?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course. I’ll have Lukako turn back into a guy.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t know if she’s going to appreciate that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s why I’m consulting you, so I can find a way to do this while hurting her the least.”[%p]
I take a mouthful of Dr P in a vain attempt to quiet my frustration.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...If only I hadn’t been so careless.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I shouldn’t have let so many people send D-Mails.”[%p]
This is my punishment.[%p]
I must shoulder the pain of everyone who used a D-Mail -- Suzuha, Faris, and now Lukako.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Regret won’t change anything.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There’s only one piece of advice I can give.”[%p]
Christina sighs, blowing her bangs.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t say anything to Urushibara-san.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Based on what you’ve told me, you have the advantage this time. You already know the contents of the D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So you don’t have to tell her -- him? Ex-him?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...You don’t have to tell Urushibara-san. Just send the cancellation D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You mean pose as Lukako and send the mail to her mother myself?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If the worldline changes, then that will all be undone.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In which case, ethical concerns don’t really matter.”[%p]
The end justifies the means. A philosophy worthy of a scientist.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just one problem.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t know her mother’s pager number.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What!? Are you an idiot!? Why didn’t you write it down!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I didn’t think I would need it!”[%p]
Kurisu clicks her tongue. She rubs her brow with her fingers while muttering and thinking.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What if you just ask for the pager number directly? Think up a good excuse.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s going to look suspicious...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What are you so scared of? That’s not the vain and arrogant Okabe I know.”[%p]
Vain and arrogant? That was uncalled for.[%p]
I don’t have time to be “Hououin Kyouma” now.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Just make up some nonsense like you always do. I mean, you know how gullible she is, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Wow, I hate myself for saying that. I’m a bad girl.”[%p]
Kurisu hangs her head.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe I should just tell her the truth. Sincerity will work better than underhanded tricks... I think.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“A mad scientist, sincere? That’s a good one.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s more like you to say ’I’ll brainwash her, muhahaha!’.”[%p]
I’m being serious, dammit![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I will shoulder Lukako’s pain. That’s my responsibility.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When I cancel that D-Mail, the fact that she was a girl will be undone.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m the only one who can carry that burden.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So what are you talking to me for? Go to her now, and tell her what you told me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah... you’re right.”[%p]
That’s my only choice.[%p]
As always, there are only a few worshipers at the shrine.[%p]
I guess that’s how it can keep its dignified silence, even though it’s less than a 10 minute walk from Akihabara Station.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ah, Okabe-san...”[%p]
Lukako is sweeping the courtyard.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I-I’m sorry, I left Samidare in my room...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, that’s okay.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“R-really?”[%p]
Well, crap.[%p]
Now that we’re face to face, I can’t bring myself to tell her the truth.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Is... something wrong?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-well...”[%p]
I recall Lukako’s crying face.[%p]
She looked very sad when I called her a guy. If possible, I don’t want to make her cry again.[%p]
No! Why am acting so weak!?[%p]
I can’t stop here.[%p]
I swore I would do anything to save Mayuri.[%p]
And when Lukako said he wanted to be a girl, he probably only said it out of curiosity.[%p]
If I explain everything properly, I doubt she’ll refuse to become a guy again.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Uh, yes!?”[%p]
I grab her by the shoulders and pull her close. Lukako’s cheeks instantly turn bright red.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please listen carefully. The truth is...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You used to be a guy.”[%p]
...[%p]
... ...[%p]
... ... ...[%p]
No reaction.[%p]
Or so I thought. Then tears start welling up in Lukako’s eyes.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“You’re... saying that again? Sniff...”[%p]
Damn! I made her cry again.[%p]
But this time, I don’t back down.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Listen! Unless you turn back into a guy... Mayuri will die.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh...”[%p]
I explain everything.[%p]
About time travel.[%p]
About the D-Mail Lukako sent.[%p]
About Mayuri’s fate.[%p]
About how to avoid it.[%p]
I talk and talk without pausing for breath.[%p]
Finally, I’m done.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“You’re... joking, right?”[%p]
Her voice is trembling.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I can’t... believe any of it...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“This is more roleplaying, right? You’re being Kyouma-san, right? Right?”[%p]
She backs away from me, shaking her head.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I don’t like that backstory. It hurts... and I think it would hurt Mayuri-chan too...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know you’re confused, hearing this so suddenly. But it’s all true. I’ve witnessed her death countless times.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry. I know I’m being selfish. But I’m begging you. To save Mayuri... I need you to become a guy again.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Please tell me you’re joking, Okabe-san...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I can’t possibly be a guy... I don’t want to be...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’ve always been a girl... ever since I was born. This is cruel.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“And why do I have to hear it... from you, of all people?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m so embarrassed... sniff... this isn’t right...”[%p]
Lukako covers her face with both hands to snuff out her sobs.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s to be embarrassed about? I have a harder time thinking of you as a girl anyway.”[%p]
Lukako jerks like someone poked her with a cattle prod.[%p]
Her crying has stopped.[%p]
Um...[%p]
What did I do!?[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...that’s how... you... of me...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? I couldn’t hear you.”[%p]
She lowers her hands and looks at me.[%p]
Then she smiles... a soft, sorrowful smile.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“So that’s how you think of me...”[%p]
Then, Lukako shakes off my hands and runs away.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako! Wait!!”[%p]
She doesn’t stop even when I call her.[%p]
She disappears into the shrine office.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
It turned out just as my mental simulations predicted.[%p]
I sigh and leave the shrine, dejected.[%p]
I need to come up with a plan...[%p]
