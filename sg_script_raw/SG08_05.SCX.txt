When I get back to the lab, I take Kurisu out to the bench and explain what happened.[%p]
Kurisu listens with an annoyed expression the whole time. When I finish, she glares at me and says--[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You raised a flag.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you talking about?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t you get it? You raised a flag. Or I guess you could say you tripped over a flag that was already raised.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You mean a death flag?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why!? It’s a romance flag, genius.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...!”[%p]
A... romance flag?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Urushibara-san likes you.”[%p]
Kurisu thrusts her finger at me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“When her beloved Hououin Kyouma told her she was a guy, it tore her pure maidenly heart into tiny little pieces.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In other words, your plan was a massive failure.”[%p]
She sure is calm when it’s my neck on the line.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Love is trouble. There’s no formula for calculating people’s feelings. Too many unknowns to solve for.”[%p]
She shakes her head like she can’t imagine anything worse.[%p]
Has this girl never been in love?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The direct approach was a mistake. It’ll be even harder to persuade her now.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You should think of another way this time. Like asking her mother directly.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Though I’m sure the Urushibara family already thinks of you as the man who made their daughter cry. So they might have their guard up.”[%p]
Lukako likes me?[%p]
I don’t want to believe it.[%p]
I mean, I appreciate the sentiment, but...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Um... when do you think I first set off that romance flag?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“How should I know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I mean, think about it. Lukako was a guy last week. If he already liked me at that point, then...”[%p]
Uh-oh.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s just your perspective.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“From everyone else’s perspective, she was always a girl. It makes perfect sense.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Think in terms of the current worldline.”[%p]
R-right. It makes perfect sense.[%p]
Still...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, there’s a bigger problem.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Will changing Urushibara-san’s gender to male really bring the IBN 5100 back?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Something is different from the previous worldline.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“According to Lukako’s father, the IBN 5100 was definitely at Yanabayashi Shrine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha gave it to Faris’s dad. After he died, Faris donated it to Yanabayashi Shrine...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That sequence is the same as on the worldline where I obtain the IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So you’re gradually approaching the original worldline.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You know, I’ve been thinking. You really shouldn’t be able to change the worldline so easily.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What makes you say that?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I mean, there are six billion people in the world.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It doesn’t make sense that switching a single person’s gender could cause such a huge change in the worldline.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“According to Suzuha, taking different actions after a time leap will only change divergence by around 0.000001%, if at all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But when I canceled Faris’s D-Mail, there was a 0.05% change.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“0.05% is pretty big.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What did Amane-san have to say about that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The year 2010 is a major attractor field junction, and the key is whether or not I obtain an IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Maybe the divergence meter actually measures your distance to the IBN 5100...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In any case, what you’re saying is that all of the D-Mails we sent had an influence on the IBN 5100’s location somehow?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There were also some D-Mails that didn’t activate Reading Steiner.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hmmm. So just cancel the D-Mails that activated Reading Steiner, and the IBN 5100 might come back to you.”[%p]
The remaining D-Mails were sent by Lukako, and...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Kiryu Moeka.”[%p]
I don’t want to see that woman again if I can help it.[%p]
In any case, I should focus on Lukako right now.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So what should I do about Lukako?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well, you tripped a romance flag, so...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hmm...”[%p]
Kurisu ponders this for a while.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Ah!”[%p]
Then she blushes, for some reason, and turns away.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“B-by the way, Okabe. Is there... someone you like?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wh-why aren’t you answering?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Not really.”[%p]
For a second, Mayuri’s face floated through my mind.[%p]
But I feel more of a need to protect her, rather than romantic love for her.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh... okay.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why do you ask?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ah, no, just wondering! There’s no hidden meaning, okay!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why are you mad? Also, your face is red.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Is not!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“A-anyway! You should go out with Urushibara-san!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Seriously?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Y-you don’t like anyone else, right? Then answer her feelings, you dummy.”[%p]
What did I do to deserve this name-calling?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri dies in two days. I don’t have time to play boyfriend.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Just go out with her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Seriously?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If there’s nobody you like, then there’s no reason not to, is there?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Get close and help her work through her feelings. Then she’ll probably tell you what you need to know.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri dies in two days. I don’t have time for that touchy-feely stuff.”[%p]
Suddenly, Kurisu’s expression turns grave.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Only consider this as a last resort.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you’re willing to hurt Urushibara-san, you can always take the information by force.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“She’ll forget after the worldline changes, won’t she? In that case, I think it’s a valid option.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But only when compared to Mayuri’s death.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I hate myself for suggesting this.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, you’re right. I need to consider every possible option.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I don’t want to do that if there’s any other choice.”[%p]
I’m not saying this for myself.[%p]
From my perspective, when the worldline changes, everything until that point becomes undone.[%p]
But what about from Lukako’s perspective?[%p]
What if this worldline continues after I leave it behind?[%p]
The Lukako of this worldline will have to live with what I did to her.[%p]
That possibility exists. Suzuha said that’s not the case, but there’s no way to be sure.[%p]
And since I can’t confirm or deny that possibility, I don’t want to use Kurisu’s last resort.[%p]
Besides, I have the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
And as long as I have it, I can repeat the days before Mayuri’s death forever.[%p]
Of course, there’s still the danger of a time leap failure...[%p]
In any case, the first thing I should do is have an honest talk with the girl in question.[%p]
