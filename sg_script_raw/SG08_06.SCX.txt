I hear the tweeting of small birds outside the window.[%p]
It’s nice and cool early in the morning, even though it’s the middle of summer.[%p]
Too bad the cicadas are already chirping.[%p]
The sunlight’s not too strong yet.[%p]
I couldn’t get a wink of sleep. I was up all night thinking about Lukako.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin? Ah, there you are!”[%p]
Mayuri enters the room and looks at me with a disapproving pout.[%p]
She didn’t say “tutturu♪” It’s rare to see her in such a bad mood.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re early. It’s still eight. Something happening today?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m here to scold you, Okarin!”[%p]
She gives me a glare that’s more cute than frightening.[%p]
She’s never been very good at getting angry.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s very disappointed in you!”[%p]
Mayuri puffs out her cheeks and thrusts a finger at me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What did I do?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You can’t fool me, Okarin. You made Luka-chan cry, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“H-how did you...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Luka-chan told me. She said you said she was a guy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn...”[%p]
Those two are close friends. I should have known Lukako would go to Mayuri first![%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Why would you say such a mean thing, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“M-Mayuri, it doesn’t involve you. This is a serious, confidential matter involving the Organization--”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It does too involve me. Luka-chan is Mayushii’s friend!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“If you don’t tell me, we’re not friends anymore, okay? I’m gonna quit being a lab mem!”[%p]
This is the first time I’ve ever seen Mayuri so angry.[%p]
I’m not sure how to deal with this, honestly.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Why did you say such a mean thing?”[%p]
I did it to save you.[%p]
But I can’t say that.[%p]
I don’t have it in me to tell this innocent girl that she’s fated to die in just two days.[%p]
Come to think of it, was it a mistake to tell Lukako about Mayuri’s murder?[%p]
I did make sure to tell Lukako not to breathe a word of it.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...You’re worried about something, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
She’s sharp, even though she never seems to be thinking anything.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I can tell. I’ve been watching you longer than anyone, Okarin...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And yesterday, you talked with Chris-chan for a looong time, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“If something’s wrong, you should talk to Mayushii too, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I want to help too... okay? Now, let’s go apologize to Luka-chan. Will you do that for me? Mayushii will come too, so let’s--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh... heh heh heh, muhahahaha!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“O-Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Come now, Mayuri. Me, worry? Don’t be ridiculous!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma! I have nothing to worry about!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“All I have... is the hunger for chaos! Muhahahaha!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin...”[%p]
I can’t tell Mayuri. I can’t.[%p]
Even if Mayuri hates me for it.[%p]
Something important? What?[%p]
I told her everything yesterday, including about Mayuri’s death.[%p]
Perhaps, after sleeping on it, she finally decided to believe my story.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alright...”[%p]
I get up from the sofa.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Where are you going? Mayushii’s not done talking.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m going to Lukako’s.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really? You’re going to apologize? Then let Mayushii come too!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, that will just make it harder.”[%p]
I put my hand on Mayuri’s shoulder.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please, take care of the lab while I’m gone.”[%p]
Mayuri’s shoulders droop. She looks sad for some reason, but she lets me go.[%p]
When I reach the shrine, I find Lukako standing alone in the courtyard. She’s dressed in regular clothes instead of her miko garb.[%p]
She still hasn’t noticed me.[%p]
Lukako stands still in the silent courtyard. The only movement comes from the trees swaying in the summer breeze. It’s like a scene from a movie.[%p]
I stop and watch in fascination.[%p]
Finally, Lukako turns around.[%p]
Our eyes meet.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Ahem.”[%p]
I awkwardly clear my throat and walk towards him -- uh, her.[%p]
Lukako bows her head.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“You came...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Thank you.”[%p]
We stare at each other in silence.[%p]
Crap. This is awkward.[%p]
I can’t stand the silence, so I try to start the conversation.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What did you tell Mayuri?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...S-sorry. But Mayuri-chan’s the only one I could talk to about this.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I mean, how much did you tell her?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I kept most of it a secret. Especially the stuff about her dying...”[%p]
That’s a relief.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you still think I’m joking?”[%p]
Lukako shakes her head.[%p]
She believes me?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Umm, you said you had something important to talk about, nya?”[%p]
I’m trying to be gentle, but for some reason I wind up talking like Faris.[%p]
I really don’t know how to deal with Lukako now that she’s a girl.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...Um.”[%p]
Lukako takes a deep breath, as if to prepare herself.[%p]
Her face is turning red for some reason.[%p]
She opens her mouth to speak, then closes it again. This continues for several cycles.[%p]
What’s wrong with her?[%p]
Her tension is getting to me. My heart starts pounding like an alarm bell.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-yes?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...want to ask...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san... about what you said yesterday...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I... believe you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“T-that’s great!”[%p]
So she’s willing to go back to being a guy, even though I hurt her feelings![%p]
For her to believe me in spite of that makes me pretty happy.[%p]
But something’s strange about Lukako. She still looks wound up pretty tight.[%p]
In fact, it’s gotten worse. Now she looks on the verge of tears.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...so, well...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“In exchange... for becoming a guy again...”[%p]
In exchange? She wants something in return?[%p]
I wasn’t expecting this.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“For today... and tomorrow...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“We can stop... before Mayuri-chan is in danger...”[%p]
What? What is she talking about?[%p]
My throat goes dry.[%p]
I’m so tense and I don’t know why.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...so...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Please be my...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Hm? I couldn’t hear you. One more time.”[%p]
Lukako’s voice was even softer than ever.[%p]
So soft that I couldn’t hear her from here.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Please be my b...end”[%p]
No good, I still can’t hear her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Speak up. I’ll do anything I can.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Boy...end...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“P-please be my boyfriend!”[%p]
.........[%p]
What?[%p]
B o y f r i e n d.[%p]
It takes me a while to process the word.[%p]
Meanwhile, Lukako starts squirming and fidgeting. She refuses to look me in the eye.[%p]
My heart is pounding.[%p]
What’s going on?[%p]
What did she say to me?[%p]
B o y f r i e n d.[%p]
Boy friend.[%p]
Boyfriend.[%p]
She wants me to be her boyfriend until tomorrow?[%p]
WHAT!?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wh-why?”[%p]
Without thinking, I ask the worst possible question.[%p]
Lukako curls up even smaller.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...like you.”[%p]
Her voice is as small as the buzzing of a mosquito, but it has all the courage she can muster.[%p]
I feel my heart tighten at those words.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Silence.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
More silence.[%p]
W-wait just a second.[%p]
This is too sudden.[%p]
I mean, maybe it’s not sudden, exactly.[%p]
I’ve known about Lukako’s feelings since yesterday, when Kurisu told me about the romance flag.[%p]
But still, I didn’t think it would come to this.[%p]
My mind goes blank.[%p]
I can’t think straight.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
Lukako hangs her head, waiting for my answer.[%p]
She looks so cute and innocent. I feel myself drawn to--[%p]
NO![%p]
NO NO NO![%p]
That’s wrong![%p]
That’s just wrong![%p]
I am NOT attracted to Lukako![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“L-let me think about it! Give me two -- no, five minutes!”[%p]
I turn and flee like a scared rabbit.[%p]
I’m so embarrassed, I can’t look back.[%p]
Ten minutes later, I get back to the lab. Mayuri’s eating a red bean bun.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin! How’d it go?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Did you apologize to Luka-chan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Uh, yeah. So put the Juicy Chicken Number One in the microwave and nuke it so that the D-Mail’s basically ABC and...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huwha?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The microwave was developed by knights of the [color index="820000"]Rosicrucian Order[color index="800000"] who used [color index="820000"]alchemy[color index="800000"]. Meaning that the sound of the chime is the brainwashing device, while the chime itself actually doesn’t have any meaning at all...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Waaah, Okarin’s broken!”[%p]
I mutter incoherently as I set up the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What are you doing?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“M-making a tactical retreat.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Retreat...?”[%p]
How far do I go?[%p]
As far as I can. Yeah, that’s it.[%p]
Far. Far away from here.[%p]
I jump all the way back to August 11th, the limit of the Time Leap Machine’s range.[%p]
When I’m done, Kurisu is standing before me, fiddling with the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s wiring.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Stop staring. You’re distracting me. How many times do I have to tell you?”[%p]
She’s still working on the Time Leap Machine upgrade.[%p]
I know I shouldn’t interrupt her, but there’s nobody else I can rely on.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Genius neuroscientist, I need to talk to you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Make it short.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I want you to come with me to Yanabayashi Shrine.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Tell me why. If it’s a date or something, then I refuse.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“H-Hououin Kyouma does not go on [color index="A0140000"]dates[color index="800000"]. Much less with his assistant. Ridiculous.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
She’s glaring like she’s gonna kill me.[%p]
Let’s leave the jokes aside for now...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“S-so... I need you to explain the differences between the male brain and the female brain.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What.”[%p]
I briefly explain my situation and what happened with Lukako before I leaped.[%p]
How many times have I explained this to Kurisu now?[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san... and Makise-san. Did you come to pray?”[%p]
Not exactly...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“A-ahem. Actually, we have something to talk to you about, Urushibara-san.”[%p]
This is the strategy I thought up. Its name is Operation Christina.[%p]
Lukako reacts differently to me.[%p]
I already know she’ll have a breakdown if I tell her she’s a guy.[%p]
But she’s not too familiar with Kurisu, and they’re both girls, so it should be easier if Kurisu tells her. That’s why I forced -- I mean, persuaded Kurisu to handle it.[%p]
So I wait behind Kurisu and watch silently.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“What might that be?”[%p]
Lukako is shy. He was distant with me back when we first met.[%p]
And I can see she’s made a small wall between herself and Kurisu now too.[%p]
On the other hand, Kurisu’s very calm. Truly reliable.[%p]
Kurisu puts on a gentle smile and begins her explanation.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Did you know? Male and female brains are very different.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“What...?”[%p]
Hey...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Male brains are right-dominant. Female brains are left-dominant.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Y-yeah...?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“By the way, the right brain handles image processing, spacial processing, and comprehensive judgment. The left brain handles things like language, and calculation.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The right and left brains are connected by the corpus callosum, which is more developed in females.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You know how people say that girls are better at multitasking? That can be explained by the development of the corpus callosum.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Uh... what...?”[%p]
What the hell is she talking about?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Actually, these theories are kinda fringe. They’re not really that credible.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So if you don’t mind, I’d like to do an experiment.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“A-an experiment?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I want to try mapping your brain patterns to see if they’re more female or male.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“What is mapping...?”[%p]
Lukako’s clearly frightened.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Brainwave mapping. We just take a sample of your brainwaves. Anyway, you’ll understand if you try it. Okay? Okay? It won’t hurt a bit.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“N-no thanks...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’ll be okay, I promise. It won’t hurt a bit. Just come to the lab and we’ll--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What kind of perverted old man are you!?”[%p]
I lightly chop Kurisu on the head.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Fwahn! Wh-what!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t you what me! What did we come here for!? What are you going to do if you scare Lukako away!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m just treating her like a valuable test sub--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Go back to the lab, you experiment-loving girl!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yeah, okay. So that’s the thanks I get for going out of my way to help you. I’m gone. You’re on your own now.”[%p]
Kurisu leaves the shrine with squared shoulders, muttering darkly to herself.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... what was Makise-san talking about?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, basically...”[%p]
D-do I have to explain it myself after all?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-you’re actually a guy.”[%p]
The result is the same, of course.[%p]
I hear the tweeting of small birds outside the window.[%p]
It’s morning now.[%p]
It’s nice and cool early in the morning, even though it’s the middle of summer.[%p]
Too bad the cicadas are already chirping.[%p]
The sun’s not too strong yet.[%p]
This is the second time I’ve woken up like this, though the date was different the first time.[%p]
In any case, my mental state is exactly the same as back then.[%p]
Through the front door, I hear someone stomping up the stairs.[%p]
I jump up, thinking it’s Moeka, but then I realize who it is.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin? There you are!”[%p]
Mayuri enters and greets me with a disapproving pout.[%p]
Originally, Mayuri was supposed to stay over at the lab, but last night she got a call from someone and left in a hurry.[%p]
...She probably went to see Lukako.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s very disappointed in you!”[%p]
Mayuri puffs out her cheeks and thrusts a finger at me.[%p]
Of course...[%p]
I sigh in frustration.[%p]
Before I time leaped, this happened on the 14th.[%p]
Today is the 12th. Since I explained the situation to Lukako early, it looks like Mayuri’s protest came early too.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You made Luka-chan cry, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Luka-chan told me. She said you said she was a guy.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Why would you say such a mean thing, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I’m going to see her now, so don’t worry.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“R-really? Thank goodness. If you weren’t gonna apologize, then Mayushii was never gonna talk to you again.”[%p]
That mail should come any minute now.[%p]
It actually came.[%p]
If I go to Yanabayashi Shrine now, Lukako will confess her love and ask me to be her boyfriend.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“P-please be my boyfriend!”[%p]
But this time, I thought ahead.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina! Christina!”[%p]
I start yelling at the development room, and begin to hear the sounds of someone moving inside.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Is Chris-chan sleeping? She worked all night, so you shouldn’t wake her up.”[%p]
I know, but I have to do this.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina! Please wake up!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Oh, shut up.”[%p]
Kurisu comes out of the development room with sleepy eyes.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Chris-chan, tutturu♪”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Last night, she fell asleep at the desk. The sleeves of her clothes left a mark on her cheek.[%p]
Her hair’s frayed. Her eyes are red.[%p]
She rubs those red eyes.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What is it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m going to Yanabayashi Shrine. Come with me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s time for Operation Christina II.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Until... the 15th...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“We can stop... before Mayuri-chan is in danger...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...so...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Please be my...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Please be my b...end...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Boy...end...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“P-please be my boyfriend!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Same as before.[%p]
Only this time, I have to be her boyfriend for four days instead of just two.[%p]
I guess you could say it’s a bold proposal.[%p]
Fortunately, I came prepared.[%p]
It’s time to set Operation Christina II into motion.[%p]
Last time, things got complicated when I added that experiment-loving girl to the conversation.[%p]
This time, I had her watch things from the shadows near the staircase.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“E-excuse me. I need a moment.”[%p]
I turn my back to Lukako and call Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Sup, you filthy [color index="820000"]normal[color index="8A0000"]?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who’s a normal? Think about how I feel for once.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you hear what Lukako said just now?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“No. Fill me in.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You weren’t listening!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“How am I supposed to listen from all the way over here?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She confessed. Until the 15th. Then back to manhood.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Roger.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“And? Why are you asking me? Just grant Urushibara-san’s wish.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“B-but it’s Lukako!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“What’s wrong with her? I mean, look how cute she is.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But she’s a--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Her being a guy might just be your imagination.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“From my perspective, she’s always been a girl.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gh...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Just give up. Bye.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah, wai--”[%p]
She hung up.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn! Why did I even bring her along?”[%p]
What a useless assistant![%p]
I stuff my phone into my pocket and head back to Lukako.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... were you on the phone... with Makise-san?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hm? Oh, yeah...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Oh...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“You looked like you were having fun...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“N-nonsense.”[%p]
Is this pressure? Is she applying psychological pressure!?[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“So...”[%p]
Lukako fidgets restlessly.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Your... answer...”[%p]
“Please be my boyfriend.”[%p]
A four-day trial relationship.[%p]
Will those four days feel long, or short?[%p]
I mean... sure, Lukako is cute.[%p]
She’s very slender and delicate, especially around the waist, and her skin is as white as alabaster.[%p]
Even when Lukako was a guy, I occasionally found myself mesmerized by his girlish demeanor.[%p]
Biologically, the current Lukako is a girl. So even if we do... stuff... there shouldn’t be a problem.[%p]
But still...[%p]
I’m on a mission to change Lukako back into a guy.[%p]
I need to accomplish that mission to save Mayuri.[%p]
If I go out with the girl Lukako and fall in love with her...[%p]
Then will I be able to treat guy Lukako like I used to?[%p]
If I forget he’s a guy and lose my self-control, it could result in... complications.[%p]
Going out with the current Lukako isn’t the problem.[%p]
I mean, I still have my reservations, but cuteness is justice, right?[%p]
The real source of my hesitation is the thought of what happens afterwards.[%p]
The problem isn’t Lukako, but my own heart.[%p]
Besides, I’m supposed to be saving Mayuri, not going out on dates.[%p]
But on the other hand, Lukako’s cooperation is essential to save Mayuri.[%p]
I won’t get anywhere if I reject Lukako and make her cry.[%p]
For the sake of my goal, I must overcome the problems of my heart.[%p]
I’ll do it.[%p]
I’ll take Lukako’s deal.[%p]
But if we’re going to do this, I tell myself, there’s one rule that you must follow.[%p]
...You must not fall in love with Lukako.[%p]
Even if it means trampling on her heart, you must not fall in love.[%p]
Fall in love, and you could end up walking the forbidden path.[%p]
Lukako is a guy. A guy. A guy. A guy. A guy.[%p]
GuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuyGuy...[%p]
And don’t you forget it.[%p]
Just... don’t forget.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Very well.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll go out with you. But only until the 15th.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ah...”[%p]
Tears immediately fall from Lukako’s eyes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wh-why are you crying!?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Sniff... I’m h-happy...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I was sure that you’d say no...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Thank goodness... thank goodness... sniff...”[%p]
Her face is red, and her eyes are wet with tears, yet she’s really happy. Seeing her like this, all shy and embarrassed but happy at the same time, makes me feel--[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
She’s... too cute![%p]
I mustn’t fall in love, but I’m about to![%p]
Why does every single one of her actions have to be so cute?[%p]
She must be doing it on purpose! There’s no other way![%p]
Lukako’s cuteness is a terror of the universe.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...Um, Okabe-san?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wh-what!?”[%p]
Lukako wipes her tears away.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... tomorrow... a da...”[%p]
“Da”?[%p]
What does she mean by “da”?[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Please... take me... on a date.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What...did you say...?”[%p]
A date...?[%p]
True, when a couple goes somewhere together, that’s called a date.[%p]
It would really be a dick move if I refused to go on a date right after we started going out.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Okay, but where?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh...”[%p]
Doesn’t look like she’s got a place in mind.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I want to go where you want to go, Okabe-san...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um, I want to know more about the places you frequent, Okabe-san...”[%p]
So in other words, she wants me to decide for her?[%p]
It’s really unfair to be so cute. People will forgive you for anything you say.[%p]
I scratch my head in thought.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Then I’ll come up with something by tomorrow.”[%p]
For now, I just want to get out of this sickeningly sweet atmosphere that’s brewing.[%p]
