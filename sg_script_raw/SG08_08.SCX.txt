The next day finds me strolling around Akiba with Lukako.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“So... where to next?”[%p]
Event #1, lunch at a family restaurant, is already complete. I took care of the bill, and now we’re back out in the heat.[%p]
I’ve got the entire day planned out in my head.[%p]
The next event is...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How about we take a walk around town?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh? Um, okay.”[%p]
It’s Obon holiday, so Akiba is crowded.[%p]
To avoid the crowds, we end up walking through the back streets.[%p]
My plan is to walk with Lukako all the way to Ueno and back. That should be enough, right?[%p]
I walk quickly.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
This “conversation” thing isn’t going so well.[%p]
I tried to follow the guide’s advice and be a good listener, but Lukako’s silent by nature. She doesn’t really start talking on her own.[%p]
Even at the family restaurant, the words we exchanged were mostly just things like “It’s crowded today,” “It’s delicious,” and “It was delicious.”[%p]
And I think it was a mistake to just wander around.[%p]
Especially since we’ve ended up in a residential area with no interesting scenery whatsoever.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... Okabe-san.”[%p]
Lukako speaks up. She’s a few steps behind me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah?”[%p]
I stop and turn around.[%p]
Lukako catches up, and we start walking together again.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...Do you remember?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“About the first time you and I met.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yeah.”[%p]
Of course, what I actually remember is how I met the male Lukako.[%p]
It was during Golden Week in May.[%p]
I was searching Akiba for materials to build a new Future Gadget when I saw Lukako in his miko garb, surrounded by some cameramen.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“P-please stop... I can’t...”[%p]
[name]Low-Angler A[line]“P-please, let me take just one photo.”[%p]
[name]Low-Angler B[line]“That cosplay is super moe. I’ve never seen such a cute miko cosplayer before.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Th-this isn’t cosplay...”[%p]
[name]Low-Angler A[line]“If you could make a cute pose, I’d be su-super happy.”[%p]
[name]Low-Angler B[line]“D-do that thing, you know, that thing Megumi-tan does in [color index="820000"]Miko Miko Overdrive[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Low-Angler A[line]“Yeah! That would be awesome! You know Megumi-tan, right? Can you do it for us?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I-I don’t know, sorry...”[%p]
[name]Low-Angler B[line]“What’s wrong? If you come to Akiba in cosplay, that means you want people to take your picture, right?”[%p]
[name]Low-Angler A[line]“That’s right. Or are you rejecting us ’cause we’re losers?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“N-no... it’s just... this isn’t cosplay...”[%p]
To be honest, the miko garb fascinated me.[%p]
Because miko are sacred, chosen to serve the gods.[%p]
I know college girls are doing it for money these days, but as far as I’m concerned, that’s sacrilege.[%p]
As is demanding to photograph a sacred miko. I couldn’t let it pass.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You with the cameras!”[%p]
[name]Low-Angler A[line]“Eh?”[%p]
[name]Low-Angler B[line]“Wh-who are you...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]”Heh! Who am I? I am the great Hououin Kyouma, bearer of the mightiest brain since Einstein himself, the insane mad scientist who will bring chaos to the world! Muhahaha!” [%p]
[name]Low-Angler A[line]“Wh-what’s with this guy?”[%p]
[name]Low-Angler B[line]“He’s nuts.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stop right there. This miko clearly does not want your attention!”[%p]
[name]Low-Angler A[line]“G-get out of here, chuunibyou!”[%p]
[name]Low-Angler B[line]“You trying to be cool and save a girl for [color index="820000"]smex[color index="800000"] in return? You’re just another pervert!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Look in the mirror when you say that. You’re the ones harassing this frail girl, forcing her to take perverted pictures. Have you no otaku pride?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um, I’m a...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]”A cameraman who frightens a sacred miko is no cameraman at all! He’s nothing but lowlife scum, unfit to walk the holy streets of Akiba!” [%p]
[name]Low-Angler A[line]“Wh-what!? Everyone’s aiming for low-angle shots of cute 3D girls!”[%p]
[name]Low-Angler B[line]“Amateur cosplayers should take what they get. When you cosplay in Akiba, you’re asking to get photographed! That’s how it works.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“N-no... I... I’m...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“A guy!”[%p]
Instantly, our jaws dropped to the ground.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“So... there’s no point in photographing me...”[%p]
Lukako murmured sadly.[%p]
[name]Low-Angler A[line]“R-really?”[%p]
[name]Low-Angler B[line]“No way. Someone this cute can’t be a guy...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I am a guy.... I even have an Adam’s apple...”[%p]
Lukako lifted his chin a bit, exposing his pale neck.[%p]
That gesture was really sexy, but...[%p]
There was indeed a lump on his neck.[%p]
[name]Low-Angler A[line]“Then, you’ve got one down there, too?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
Lukako nodded, reluctantly.[%p]
He was already crying by that point.[%p]
So were the cameramen.[%p]
[name]Low-Angler B[line]“Wh-what the hell? This is fraud!”[%p]
[name]Low-Angler A[line]“What kind of guy wears miko robes? You some kinda pervert?”[%p]
[name]Low-Angler B[line]“Thank god I didn’t take a picture! I feel tricked.”[%p]
They left the place, mumbling complaints all the while.[%p]
Those bastards were a disgrace to otaku everywhere.[%p]
Daru would’ve said something like...[%p]
“Someone this cute can’t be a girl!”[%p]
“So you’re a trap? Awesome!”[%p]
Daru is the true otaku.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um, thank you very much...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hm? Nah, it’s nothing.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“But you’re disappointed that you saved a guy, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m sorry... I can’t live up to your expectations.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What’s your name?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh? Urushibara... Luka.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why are you apologizing?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I mean... I look like this... but I’m a guy...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It matters not!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It doesn’t matter if you’re a guy or a girl! We need to work on that inferiority complex of yours.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh? Eh...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Come with me! I shall bestow upon you a mighty gift! An item that will give you courage. I’m sure you, too, have noticed the true power that sleeps inside of you.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh? Ehhh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s wrong? You desire power... don’t you?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Umm... p-power?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Indeed. I can grant you power. All you need is the will, the desire, the hunger! Never again will you fear a camera lens!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“After that, we went to BladeWorks and you bought me Samidare. I didn’t expect that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah, well...”[%p]
I didn’t expect he’d actually come with me.[%p]
But when he did, I realized that he had potential.[%p]
That’s why I bought him the 980 yen (tax included) demon sword.[%p]
Afterwards, Lukako and I went through intense training to develop the Seishin Zanma school of swordsmanship.[%p]
In retrospect, I can’t believe I said all that ridiculous stuff. It makes me want to crawl in a hole and hide.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I was really surprised when you said it didn’t matter... but at the same time... it really made me happy.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It’s strange, huh. Those words really moved me.”[%p]
Lukako’s cheeks then turn rosy pink.[%p]
Her blush is too powerful. I have to look away.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ever since you said those words...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’ve liked you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Wait a second...[%p]
Wait a second.[%p]
Wait a goddamn second![%p]
Is she saying what I think she’s saying?[%p]
But that Lukako was a guy![%p]
Does that mean I made the [color index="A0140000"]guy[color index="800000"] Lukako fall in love with me?[%p]
My mind goes blank.[%p]
Oh god![%p]
By the time I drop her off back at the shrine, I’m worn out physically and mentally.[%p]
We ended up walking for four hours straight, which was tiring, but my mental exhaustion is greater.[%p]
In the end, we didn’t talk much.[%p]
We just walked.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Today... was really fun.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“R-really?”[%p]
She’s just saying that out of consideration. I can tell that she’s forcing her smile.[%p]
All through the date, I couldn’t stop thinking about the time Lukako fell in love with me, so I barely made conversation at all.[%p]
That manual was completely useless.[%p]
On this worldline, Lukako was a girl from the beginning, so Lukako’s memories of when we first met might be inconsistent with mine.[%p]
But even with that in consideration, Lukako’s story still felt out of place.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“So... um...”[%p]
Lukako fidgets as she whispers.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wh-what is it?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Well... tomorrow...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah... eh?”[%p]
She wants to go on a date again tomorrow?[%p]
I mean, we are a couple, and we are going out, and that means we like each other, and it’s summer break right now, so it’s natural to go on a date every day...[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I want to be with Okabe-san again... tomorrow.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“T-thanks...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Is that... okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course it is. Yes. Of course.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Thank goodness...”[%p]
Lukako smiles again. She looks so happy and relieved.[%p]
Seeing her like this makes incomprehensible feelings well up inside me.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Well, see you tomorrow...”[%p]
I feel a huge weight on my shoulders.[%p]
Another date tomorrow...[%p]
Tomorrow...[%p]
