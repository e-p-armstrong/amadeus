[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪ Welcome backarin.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Die, you filthy normal.”[%p]
When I return to the lab, I am greeted by Mayuri’s smile and Daru’s pure hatred.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Since when does a chuunibyou patient like you rate a girlfriend? It’s not right, man.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“How’d your date with Luka-chan go?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well... Stage Clear, somehow. Probably.”[%p]
Probably not, actually.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“ComiMa’s the day after tomorrow, you know? What if you and Luka-chan go as a cosplay couple?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Maybe you can persuade her to go, now that you’re her boyfriend.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“She never says yes to me. And I’ve asked her so many times, too.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But if Okarin asks her, then I’m sure she’ll say OK!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I refuse.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Eh? Why?”[%p]
Because ComiMa is on the 15th.[%p]
Mayuri is fated to die that night.[%p]
How am I supposed to spend the hours before her death cosplaying at ComiMa?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“To be honest, I don’t get this dating thing.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Geh!? Okarin, you idiot, those words are an insult to virgins the world over! Apologize! Apologize to the virgins!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just think about it. All you do is walk, eat, and go home. And the whole time, you have to worry about what your partner is thinking.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s fun about that?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Don’t say that, Okarin. You’ll make Luka-chan sad.”[%p]
Mayuri’s expression is uncharacteristically serious.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You know... just being with the person she likes is enough to make a girl happy. That’s all she really needs.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Doesn’t being together make boys happy too?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“If not... that makes Mayuri sad.”[%p]
Why would that make Mayuri sad?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin’s the minority. I mean, dates are a great opportunity for H-scenes.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re an idiot.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Come on! Holding hands and stuff’s pretty H, isn’t it? And when you’re arm-in-arm and her boob hits your elbow, that’s like super mega H!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And then at the end of the date, you kiss, right!? Damn you! Death to normals!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You play too much eroge.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, hey. When did Luka-chan fall for Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When? Well...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I was really surprised when you said it didn’t matter... but at the same time... it really made me happy.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ever since you said those words...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’ve liked you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I think back on what she said.[%p]
Something still feels off about her story.[%p]
I said that Luka’s gender didn’t matter.[%p]
I remember that clearly.[%p]
But didn’t I say that because Lukako was a guy?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Right. That doesn’t make sense.”[%p]
Now I know what feels out of place.[%p]
I wouldn’t have said that to a female Lukako. So why does this Lukako remember what I said back then?[%p]
I recall what happened with Faris.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...I remember, nya!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“The wish Faris made...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...Was to save Papa, who died ten years ago, nya.”[%p]
Faris regained her memories from before she sent the D-Mail.[%p]
Could Lukako, too, have remembered the previous worldline, where she was a guy?[%p]
That would explain everything.[%p]
However...[%p]
She remembers that event, and she said she liked me for it, so...[%p]
Did Lukako like me even when she was a guy?[%p]
I think I need to check this out.[%p]
The next morning, I head to the shrine to meet with Lukako.[%p]
She’s already waiting in the courtyard. When she sees me, she smiles and waves her hand.[%p]
Too cute... must... resist...[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Good morning.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“M-morning.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... where are we going today?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Before that...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yes?”[%p]
I make up my mind and throw out the question.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you have any memories of when you were a guy?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
Lukako twitches for a moment.[%p]
And then she hangs her head.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“N-no, I don’t...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Really?”[%p]
Lukako just nods stiffly.[%p]
I consider a more forceful approach, but the words of that dating manual blaze inside my head.[%p]
“Whatever you do, don’t make the girl sad! You might get dumped!”[%p]
If I get dumped, then what will happen to our 4-day agreement?[%p]
Lukako might refuse to turn back into a guy.[%p]
...No, Lukako’s not like that.[%p]
Mayuri’s life hangs in the balance, so I’m sure no matter what I say, she’ll turn back.[%p]
Or is it naive of me to think that?[%p]
Either way...[%p]
Even though I’m doing this to save Mayuri, I can’t just trample on Lukako’s pure maidenly heart.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
Neither one of us speaks.[%p]
Mutual distrust? Suspicion? Discomfort?[%p]
One word could shatter our temporary relationship.[%p]
Luka is the first to break the suffocating silence.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...I’m sorry.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Let’s cancel... today’s date...”[%p]
Lukako bows her head and goes back into the shrine office.[%p]
I hurt her. I feel guilty, but at the same time, relieved.[%p]
I hate myself for it.[%p]
Instead of returning to the lab, I stand on the bridge in front of the station and gaze blankly at the stream of people.[%p]
Faris might be visiting the lab.[%p]
Faris was at the lab on this day when I first came to this worldline.[%p]
My actions shouldn’t have influenced Mayuri’s, so she should have called Faris over to show her the costumes.[%p]
Right now, I don’t want to see anybody.[%p]
I need to think.[%p]
But try as I might, no ideas come. No solutions.[%p]
Lukako agreed to go back to being a guy if I went out with her for a time. I’ve stayed faithful to that, so...[%p]
Faithful? How?[%p]
I just made a huge mistake back there![%p]
I’ve done nothing but make Lukako sad.[%p]
Tomorrow...[%p]
Tomorrow is the 15th. The day ComiMa opens. The day Mayuri dies.[%p]
At the very least, I need to make our relationship last until that evening.[%p]
Tomorrow is the end.[%p]
But I’m not confident I can show Lukako a fun time.[%p]
Alright. So instead of fussing over a date, I’ll just try something that won’t make Lukako sad.[%p]
