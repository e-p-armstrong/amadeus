The next morning, after Mayuri and Daru have left for Ariake, I head to the shrine to pick up Lukako.[%p]
We hop the train at Akiba station. When she looks askance at me, I tell her we’re going to see Mayuri.[%p]
Today it won’t just be the two of us.[%p]
I don’t know what to say when we’re alone. I’m afraid I’ll just hurt her again.[%p]
It’s time to try something different.[%p]
When we get off the train at Tokyo Big Sight, Lukako stares in wonder at the scene spread before her.[%p]
People, people, people.[%p]
People as far as the eye can see.[%p]
Welcome to ComiMa, the otaku festival.[%p]
It’s the first day, so Big Sight’s more crowded than usual.[%p]
This is my plan: to take Lukako to ComiMa.[%p]
I’m not making her cosplay, of course. Lukako wouldn’t even do it at Mayuri’s request, and I don’t want to force her to do anything she doesn’t want to.[%p]
We’re just here to look and have fun.[%p]
The first order of business is to hook up with Mayuri and Daru. Those two live and breathe ComiMa, so I’m sure they’ll have a lot to talk about.[%p]
Conversation will flow, and I’ll be off the hook.[%p]
How wonderful to have friends you can count on![%p]
Of course, bringing a date to ComiMa is a surefire way to earn myself the hatred of otaku everywhere, but no matter. I’ll endure their contempt if that’s what it takes to make Lukako happy.[%p]
So resolved, I strike out through the crowd towards our designated rendezvous point. Lukako, clearly overwhelmed by the sheer number of people, struggles to follow behind.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪ Okarin! Luka-chan!”[%p]
Near the edge of the parking lot, I see the petite Mayuri wave her hands high.[%p]
There aren’t as many people here.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Welcome to ComiMa, Luka-chan.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Y-yeah. It’s my first time coming here, but it’s amazing...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Take it easy!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where’s Daru?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Daru-kun’s in line for promo goods. He couldn’t come.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“He said maybe he’ll join us later, if he survives the battle.”[%p]
Damn. That means he won’t join up with us for at least another hour. [%p]
Couldn’t he forgo the battle just this once?[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
Lukako’s eyes dart from place to place. She’s clearly uncomfortable in the chaotic atmosphere.[%p]
There’s still some awkwardness between us after what happened yesterday.[%p]
Even on the train ride, we barely spoke to each other.[%p]
What’s the point in being a couple if it turns out like this?[%p]
It was easier to talk when we weren’t supposed to be boyfriend and girlfriend. Lukako seemed to enjoy herself more too.[%p]
Was it a mistake to bring her to ComiMa?[%p]
Well, Lukako didn’t refuse. Even when I told her we were going to ComiMa, she just nodded obediently.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii will show you around, okay? Um, there’s lots of people, so we’ve gotta be careful.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“First we’ll go to the cosplay area! And then we’ll go inside!”[%p]
Mayuri’s more cheerful than usual.[%p]
She must be happy to have us here.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, is there anything you guys wanna see?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Lukako, is there anything you want to see?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ah, no...”[%p]
Lukako shakes her head.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It’s my first time, so... if Okabe-san wants to see something, I’ll go see it...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not particularly interested in anything.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Lukako looks unhappy.[%p]
Crap, I shouldn’t have answered like that.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, Luka-chan. If you come to the cosplay area, I’m sure you’ll change your mind about cosplaying!”[%p]
Mayuri talks happily to Lukako.[%p]
I’m glad I chose to rely on this ditz who can’t read the mood.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s not embarrassing at all, see? ’Cause everyone’s having fun!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Kaede-chan and Fubuki-chan are there wearing Mayushii’s costumes! I’ll introduce you, okay?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You should come tomorrow too! I’ll bring costumes for you and we can cosplay together!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I think Okarin would be perfect as [color index="820000"]Zerosum[color index="800000"] from [color index="820000"]Code Jeass[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’ll cosplay if Okarin does it with you, right, Luka-chan?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You will, won’t you? Mayushii thinks it’s a great idea!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Not a chance.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“S-sorry...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Eh? No way...”[%p]
Mayuri slumps her shoulders in disappointment.[%p]
In the end, Lukako and I got fed up with the amount of people and left Ariake early.[%p]
We took the direct shuttle bus to Akiba that only runs during ComiMa, but it was so cramped inside, I thought I was gonna die.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
By the time we get back to Akiba, Lukako and I are exhausted. My feet feel like blocks of lead, and I don’t have the energy to even attempt conversation.[%p]
The two of us schlep back to the shrine without speaking a word, like Spanish monks under a vow of silence.[%p]
Lukako doesn’t raise a single complaint.[%p]
But taking her to ComiMa was obviously a mistake.[%p]
Lukako’s expression has been stiff ever since we met up with Mayuri.[%p]
Maybe she’s still traumatized by otaku.[%p]
The first time I met Lukako, he was being harassed by otaku.[%p]
Maybe they left a bad impression.[%p]
We don’t talk.[%p]
We spent most of the day shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers. I can probably count on my fingers the words I said directly to Lukako today.[%p]
When we arrive at the shrine, our time as a couple will end.[%p]
So this is our last chance to talk as boyfriend and girlfriend.[%p]
But I’m confused.[%p]
What should I talk about?[%p]
I try thinking about things we have in common.[%p]
The demon sword, Samidare.[%p]
The Seishin Zanma school of swordmanship.[%p]
But Kurisu said to avoid chuunibyou topics, and the dating manual concurred.[%p]
What else is there?[%p]
It finally dawns on me.[%p]
There’s nothing else Lukako and I share.[%p]
Silence dominates the shrine.[%p]
The silence should be calming, but it’s not.[%p]
I’ve safely escorted Lukako home.[%p]
Mayuri’s death is just three hours away.[%p]
The temporary relationship between me and Lukako ends here.[%p]
Now I just need Lukako to give me her mother’s pager number.[%p]
However...[%p]
Is it really okay to let it end like this?[%p]
In the end, what have I done for Lukako?[%p]
I haven’t done squat, have I?[%p]
All I’ve done is hurt her.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Uuh... hic...”[%p]
Suddenly, Lukako starts sobbing. She covers her mouth with both hands, but can’t stop the tears pouring from her eyes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako...”[%p]
When I approach her, Lukako pulls back.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Uugh... ugg... sniff...”[%p]
Lukako wipes the corners of her eyes, but the tears keep flowing, forming a glistening line down each cheek.[%p]
I’m speechless. I have no idea what to do.[%p]
A girl is crying before my eyes.[%p]
It’s my duty as a man to comfort her.[%p]
I know that, and yet no words come. I just stand there, like a useless statue.[%p]
The cause of Lukako’s tears is undoubtedly me.[%p]
I didn’t treat her right as my girlfriend, even if it was only a temporary arrangement.[%p]
And now it ends with me [color index="A0140000"]watching[color index="800000"] as Lukako cries.[%p]
Lukako...[%p]
I’m the one who did this to her. I’m the cause of her grief.[%p]
And yet...[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Thank you... very much...”[%p]
She thanks me and bows her head.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Eh...?”[%p]
She lifts her head and smiles shyly through her tears.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I was... really happy... sniff...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“That we could be... together...”[%p]
That’s a lie.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m glad... I fell in love... with you...”[%p]
That has to be a lie.[%p]
To my surprise, Lukako takes my hand in hers.[%p]
Her hand is very warm and delicate.[%p]
This is the first time I’ve touched her since we became a couple.[%p]
And... it will be the last.[%p]
Lukako places a note in my hand.[%p]
And then, she pulls away.[%p]
She bows her head again.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...Bye now.”[%p]
Lukako turns her back to me, then disappears into the shrine office.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I look at the note.[%p]
There’s a number written there.[%p]
Probably her mother’s pager number.[%p]
She kept her promise.[%p]
But I...[%p]
I didn’t keep mine.[%p]
I can’t let it end like this.[%p]
I run full speed back to the lab. Ignoring Kurisu’s calls to stop, I slap on the headgear and leap to the past.[%p]
