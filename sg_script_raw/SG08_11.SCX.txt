I regain consciousness in front of Akihabara Station.[%p]
Lukako is next to me. We’re about to board the train for ComiMa.[%p]
Lukako looks a little anxious, but she doesn’t raise a single complaint.[%p]
The shuttle bus pulls up. The huge line of people begins to move.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
We can’t go to ComiMa like this.[%p]
Shaking off my time leap-induced vertigo, I take Lukako by the hand.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Come on!”[%p]
Once we get out of the line, I let go of Lukako’s hand and start walking.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“O-Okabe-san? Um, the bus is here...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’re not going to ComiMa.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This time... we’re doing things my way!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san... um, where are we going?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe...san?”[%p]
I keep walking with Lukako’s hand in mine, ignoring everything else.[%p]
Lukako looks bewildered at first, but eventually, she says no more, and just starts following me with a sad expression.[%p]
We arrive at Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
A place devoid of visitors.[%p]
Where an aura of peace and dignity dominates.[%p]
Where the cries of cicadas resound.[%p]
Lukako’s home.[%p]
Finally, I turn to face Lukako.[%p]
Instead of letting go, I grasp her warm hand even tighter than before.[%p]
Perhaps it’s the heat, or perhaps it’s our nervousness, but our hands are damp with sweat.[%p]
But still, I don’t let go.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
Lukako is hanging her head.[%p]
She might cry at any moment.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“This means... our relationship is over, doesn’t it...”[%p]
Her lips tremble. Her voice trembles.[%p]
I summon my resolve and answer her with a laugh.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh! What are you talking about?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Eh...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Our couple phase isn’t over yet!”[%p]
I strike a pose and mimic a line from a popular card-battling anime.[%p]
Until I witnessed Mayuri’s death, this was how I acted all the time.[%p]
Now it takes some effort, but I still have it in me.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“B-but...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Weren’t you listening? This time, we’re doing things my way.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now, my disciple!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Bring forth the demon sword, Samidare!”[%p]
The wind blows.[%p]
The tree growing over the main building rustles its leaves in response.[%p]
Lukako looks at me blankly.[%p]
Tears form in the corners of her eyes.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Wh... what?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Isn’t it obvious? It’s time to continue your training in the Seishin Zanma school of swordsmanship!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“My training...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you already forgotten what I taught you?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“N-no... but, Oka--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s Kyouma.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...Eh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you forgotten my true name, Lukako?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!”[%p]
Swallowing my embarrassment, I strike another pose.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I was so caught up in the question of your gender that I lost sight of our true relationship.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But now I’ve finally realized the truth. Our relationship was decided from the very beginning.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Decided... how?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I may be a man and you may be a woman, but our temporary relationship as a couple...”[%p]
I take a deep breath.[%p]
I gently comb my fingers through Lukako’s hair.[%p]
I twist my lips into a grin.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Matters not!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ah...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am I. Lukako is Lukako.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And Lukako is my disciple.”[%p]
As I gently stroke her hair, Lukako puts her warm hand on top of mine.[%p]
The tears collected in the corners of her eyes suddenly fall.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Y-yes... of course. Okabe... I mean, Kyouma-san... is my master.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well said! Now, Lukako, bring forth Samidare.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“A-at once!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um, just a moment. I’ll be right back. Please stay here, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not going anywhere. So hurry.”[%p]
Lukako reluctantly lets go of my hand, shyly turns away from me, and heads to the shrine office.[%p]
We spend four hours training, just like we used to.[%p]
Practice swings with the demon sword.[%p]
Stories of the sword’s history.[%p]
Lectures on the intricacies of Seishin Zanma swordsmanship.[%p]
All fabricated from my chuunibyou delusions.[%p]
I talk. Lukako, dressed now in her miko robes, listens with rapt attention.[%p]
Occasionally, we take a break, sit on the shrine’s stairway, and eat the sweet rice balls Lukako’s mother brings us.[%p]
And that’s how we spend an extraordinarily ordinary four hours.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alright, that’s it for today.”[%p]
Lukako lowers her stance and slowly sheathes the demon sword, Samidare.[%p]
She looks so beautiful and majestic standing there in flowing white robes, sword shining in her hands.[%p]
I find myself mesmerized once again.[%p]
Lukako bows, snapping me out of it.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Thank you.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I think I got a little stronger.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No need for humility. Today, you mastered one of the Seishin Zanma style’s secrets, Type Thirty-Two Cherry Bomb.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But don’t get cocky, for you are still weak.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yes sir. I want to learn even more from you.”[%p]
The breeze feels nice after the sweat we worked up.[%p]
We savor our comfortable fatigue as we drink the barley tea Lukako’s mother brought for us.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I feel like it’s been a long time since you last taught me, Kyouma-san.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“For the past few days, my mind has been under the dread influence of the foul grimoire known as The Manual.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I’ve fully recovered. Do not worry.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...Thank goodness. You’re back to your old self.”[%p]
Lukako answers happily.[%p]
And then her expression turns serious, as if she’s made up her mind about something.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yesterday, you asked me if I had any memories from when I was a guy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, yeah...”[%p]
Lukako looks away. I see her hands fidgeting in her lap.[%p]
Finally, with trembling lips, she speaks.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I... do remember.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
No surprise.[%p]
I expected she’d remember after what I experienced with Faris.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I remember, or actually... umm, how should I say it...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It’s a very... transient feeling.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Transient...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I can’t clearly remember it, but at the bottom of my sea of memories, well... in my head, umm...”[%p]
Then Lukako starts pawing at the air above and to the right of her head.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It feels like it’s around here somewhere...”[%p]
I don’t really get it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, you remember?”[%p]
Lukako nods.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m sorry I lied yesterday...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Muhahaha! Don’t worry about it. You should be proud to have fooled the great Hououin Kyouma!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“So because I remembered, I knew Mom’s pager number without having to ask.”[%p]
She takes out a piece of paper, upon which is written the number.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I was going to give you this no matter how things turned out today.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“And... one more thing.”[%p]
One more thing?[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I don’t know if it’s related to my memories, but...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It’s about that old computer.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!?”[%p]
Now that, I didn’t expect.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The IBN 5100!?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yes... I think so...”[%p]
True, Lukako did seem like she knew something about the IBN 5100.[%p]
Plus, Luka’s dad confirmed that it was here at the shrine.[%p]
And then one day, it suddenly disappeared.[%p]
Does Lukako know where it is now?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If that’s true, Lukako, then you might not have to turn back into a guy.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
But Lukako faintly shakes her head.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I don’t think it’s that easy...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But why not?”[%p]
Lukako grips my hand.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Please come with me. I’ll show you.”[%p]
She looks into my eyes.[%p]
Lukako is no longer crying.[%p]
In the fading sunlight, her eyes shine with firm resolve.[%p]
She brings me to Daibiru.[%p]
I look up at the huge, towering building.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The IBN 5100 is here?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... not there...”[%p]
Lukako faces away from Daibiru and points.[%p]
To a coin locker tucked in a narrow alley.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It happened last year, just before New Years...”[%p]
Lukako walks up to the coin locker as she talks.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“The computer was at our shrine until then.”[%p]
Until New Years...[%p]
That’s a contradiction.[%p]
It was only two weeks ago that I found the IBN 5100 at Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
Which means I really haven’t returned to the original worldline.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It’s all my fault. I was helping out at the shrine, sweeping the storehouse when...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I broke it by accident.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You... broke it?”[%p]
Lukako nods.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“But I thought Dad would get mad at me if he found out, so...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I brought it here... and hid it in the coin locker.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It must have been tough bringing it all the way out here. That thing weighs a ton.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I used a pushcart from home. It... broke too.”[%p]
Even so, it must’ve been hard to get it here with just a pushcart.[%p]
Maybe she was running on adrenaline.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“When I heard Kyouma-san was searching for it, I was really surprised.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I know I should’ve told you the truth, but I thought you’d hate me for it, and I couldn’t say anything.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nonsense. I wouldn’t hate you for that. No matter what, you’re still my disciple.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I know.”[%p]
Lukako takes the locker key out of her pocket.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It’s already been more than half a year, so the management probably took it away...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Half a year... I guess it’s hopeless, then.”[%p]
This locker charges 200 yen per day.[%p]
Normally, if a coin locker goes unpaid for more than a few days, the management retrieves the contents.[%p]
And if the owner doesn’t claim it within a month, it’s usually thrown away.[%p]
Meaning the IBN 5100 is already...[%p]
Lukako goes to a large locker at the end of the row, inserts the key, and tries the lock.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ah... it’s not locked...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I guess that settles it.”[%p]
Sure enough, Lukako opens the door to reveal an empty locker.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...I’m sorry.”[%p]
Either way, it doesn’t matter. There’s no point in retrieving a broken IBN 5100.[%p]
But I don’t tell her that.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not your fault.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m the one who messed with the timeline. Everything that happened is my fault.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Kyouma-san...”[%p]
That’s why I must bear the burden.[%p]
Mayuri’s pain. Suzuha’s pain. Faris’s pain.[%p]
And now... Lukako’s pain.[%p]
Something occurs to me.[%p]
What if...[%p]
What if I send a D-Mail telling Lukako not to sweep the storehouse? How would that change the worldline?[%p]
Would the IBN 5100 stay at Yanabayashi Shrine, ready for me to retrieve in August, as planned?[%p]
Part of me wants to try sending that D-Mail.[%p]
If it works, Lukako could stay a girl.[%p]
No. I mustn’t give into the temptation.[%p]
My goal is to restore the worldline, not warp it further.[%p]
Fix the past to save Mayuri.[%p]
That is my mission.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... there’s something strange about my memories.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Strange how?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Inside my mind, there are two memories about that old computer mixed together...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“The first is the memory of me breaking it. The other has no memory of it at all...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“The male me didn’t break the computer. He swept the main shrine instead of the storehouse...”[%p]
So Lukako swept the storehouse because she became a girl.[%p]
Because she swept the storehouse, she broke the IBN 5100, and deposited it into this coin locker.[%p]
As a result, the IBN 5100 will never reach me.[%p]
Is this the Butterfly Effect?[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“So there’s no choice... I have to go back to being a guy.”[%p]
There’s no longer any doubt in her eyes.[%p]
“There’s no choice.”[%p]
She knows it as well as I.[%p]
