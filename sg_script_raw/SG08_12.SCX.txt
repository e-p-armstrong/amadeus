We return empty-handed to Yanabayashi Shrine, which is dyed scarlet by the setting sun.[%p]
Lukako lets go of my hand after we arrive. We spent the whole walk hand-in-hand.[%p]
Then she turns to me.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“So this is goodbye...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m really happy... that I could train with you again.”[%p]
She smiles shyly again.[%p]
But her cheeks are dyed pink.[%p]
I can tell she’s desperately holding back her tears.[%p]
But those tears hold a different meaning than the ones I saw before I time leaped.[%p]
At least, I’d like to think so.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I didn’t really do anything... boyfriend-like for you, did I?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“That doesn’t matter.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, you’re right.”[%p]
I’m sincerely relieved.[%p]
Because Lukako smiled for me.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...Please, save Mayuri-chan.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Mayuri-chan is... really important to me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ahaha... um, please, go already. If you don’t... I might cry...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“So, please...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Thank you... for everything.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Ah, this is when I use that phrase, right?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Umm, El Psy Kongalee...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s Kongroo.”[%p]
I find myself smiling.[%p]
Lukako forces a smile too.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
She bows deeply.[%p]
She doesn’t raise her head.[%p]
A sign for me to go already.[%p]
I turn back to the archway at the shrine’s entrance.[%p]
My feet are heavy.[%p]
They won’t advance.[%p]
I stop in front of the stairs.[%p]
Then I take out my phone.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okabe? Mayuri called. She was mad. You stood her up on your promise to go to ComiMa.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina. I need you to enter a number into the PhoneWave (name subject to change).”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“What? Explain yourself.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please, just do it... I’m sending a D-Mail.”[%p]
I hear a sigh on the other end of the phone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The number is...”[%p]
I tell her Lukako’s mother’s pager number, with another string of numbers attached.[%p]
“*2*2292983183129298318312929”[%p]
MeatMeatVegVegMeatMeatVegVeg.[%p]
When she sees this, Lukako’s mother will probably think it’s a prank.[%p]
And then she’ll assume the D-Mail we sent earlier was also a prank.[%p]
If that still doesn’t change the worldline, we can just try something else.[%p]
Pagers in 1992 didn’t display the sender’s number. Lukako’s mother won’t know who sent it.[%p]
I already told Kurisu the timer setting.[%p]
Everything’s ready.[%p]
I hang up once I confirm that the 42-inch CRT is on.[%p]
Now I just need to call the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
Then the worldline will change.[%p]
Lukako will turn back into a guy.[%p]
Her memories will disappear.[%p]
Mayuri won’t die today.[%p]
However.[%p]
I hesitate to open my address book.[%p]
My thoughts turn to Lukako, who is probably still watching me from behind.[%p]
If I turn around, what will I see on her face?[%p]
I want to check, but I don’t think she’d want that.[%p]
Lukako finally smiled for me today, but I still have lingering reservations inside.[%p]
This time, I’m about to sacrifice Lukako’s memories.[%p]
The memories of the 17 years she lived as a girl on this worldline.[%p]
The memories of her parents, who rejoiced when their daughter was born.[%p]
I’m about to erase all of that.[%p]
But if I don’t, I will be rejecting the 17 years Lukako lived as a guy.[%p]
I will be rejecting the memories of his parents, who rejoiced when their son was born.[%p]
Even so.[%p]
Is it okay to turn Lukako back into a guy?[%p]
I’m lost, and cannot take another step.[%p]
I’ve sacrificed the memories of two friends already.[%p]
The sight of their tears is burned into my mind.[%p]
I...[%p]
Something soft presses against my back.[%p]
Lukako has embraced me from behind.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
I hear faint sobbing.[%p]
What expression is she making now? Even without looking, I can tell.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I really... don’t want to change back...”[%p]
Her words are like needles stabbing into my heart.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Because... because...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“If I change back into a guy... I’ll have to hide my feelings for you!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It would be wrong for me to love you, if I’m a guy...”[%p]
I have nothing against homosexuals.[%p]
But unfortunately, I am heterosexual.[%p]
I won’t be able to answer Lukako’s feelings if he’s a guy.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“My memories of today will vanish too... won’t they?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“That we held hands and walked together...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“That we trained together after such a long time...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“That I’m touching Okabe-san’s body right now...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I don’t want to forget... I don’t!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Because I love you... I love you, Okabe-san!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I want to save Mayuri-chan too, and I understand there’s no other way, but...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It still hurts...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“At the very least, I want to keep my memories of today.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“If I’d known it would hurt this much...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Then I never would’ve wished to become a girl in the first place.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Sniff...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m sorry. I know ’that doesn’t matter’ to you, right? Sniff...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Even as a guy, you’re still Lukako to me. That won’t change.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yes... It makes me happy to hear you say that...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san... please send the email.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Please. Send it quickly...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“If you let me feel your warmth any longer, I...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I might say even worse things...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I can’t hold back my feelings anymore!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako...”[%p]
Is this really okay?[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san... please!”[%p]
I’m about to sacrifice someone again.[%p]
Is it my place to make that decision?[%p]
My fingers tremble around my phone.[%p]
But Lukako embraces those trembling fingers with her own.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Will you... remember me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yes.”[%p]
With just one call to the PhoneWave (name subject to change), I can send a message to Luka’s mother’s pager.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Will you remember me... as a girl?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yes.”[%p]
If I make the call...[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Will you remember these four short days we were together?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yes.”[%p]
Lukako places her finger on top of mine.[%p]
On top of the Send button.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Thank you... Okabe-san.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Farewell... my love...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No. I can’t do it!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san... Why?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]”I can’t do it anymore... I can’t sacrifice anybody else’s memories!” [%p]
I’ve already trampled on Suzuha and Faris’s memories.[%p]
I turned a blind eye to their suffering, all the while telling myself it was to save Mayuri.[%p]
I justified it by telling myself I would carry their burdens, but that was just a convenient excuse.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t have the right!”[%p]
I fall to my knees, unable to stand.[%p]
The only way to save Mayuri is to send this D-Mail.[%p]
There’s no alternative.[%p]
Even so, I don’t have the right to erase Lukako’s entire life as a girl.[%p]
I can’t do such an arrogant thing.[%p]
More than anything, I don’t want to lose the Lukako beside me right now.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san...”[%p]
Mayuri can’t be saved.[%p]
Mayuri’s death... is fate.[%p]
No matter how many worldlines I cross, convergence will occur.[%p]
Mayuri will die... no matter what.[%p]
I’m tired of it all.[%p]
Mayuri. I’m sorry.[%p]
My ego wasn’t strong enough to sacrifice everything for your sake.[%p]
