The warmth of Lukako’s hand slips away as the vertigo hits me.[%p]
I’m still at the shrine, but I no longer feel Lukako clinging to my back.[%p]
I turn around slowly.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...?”[%p]
Lukako is standing a short distance away, as if to see me off.[%p]
No tears. Just a bewildered smile.[%p]
My chest feels like it’s about to burst.[%p]
I hold it back.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Lukako.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yes?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re...”[%p]
I hesitate for a moment, but I have to know.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re a guy, right?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... yes?”[%p]
She is gone.[%p]
He has returned.[%p]
Cuter than any girl.[%p]
Looks good in miko robes.[%p]
But he’s a guy.[%p]
I bite my lip.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you... like me?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“W-what? I... don’t understand.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Do you like me?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I respect you!”[%p]
He respects me? I don’t deserve his respect.[%p]
But that’s not what matters now.[%p]
Lukako’s answer seemed clear, but wasn’t.[%p]
He didn’t answer the question.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“If I change back into a guy... I’ll have to hide my feelings for you!”[%p]
Lukako might still like me, even though he’s a guy again.[%p]
However, he’ll never speak honestly about those feelings.[%p]
This is what Lukako decided for himself. It would be wrong to pry any further.[%p]
Maybe I’m just running away.[%p]
Maybe I should pry, force him to confront his feelings.[%p]
But I’m not strong enough to accept the consequences. I’ll just end up hurting Lukako.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thanks. You are my disciple, now and forever. Agreed?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Y-yes! Of course I am.”[%p]
I look away, unable to bear his shy smile.[%p]
The worldline has changed.[%p]
Lukako is a guy again.[%p]
Which means the IBN 5100 should be here at the shrine.[%p]
On the previous worldline, girl Lukako broke the IBN 5100 while cleaning the storehouse.[%p]
But guy Lukako didn’t clean the storehouse. He never broke the IBN 5100.[%p]
It’s 6:46 PM.[%p]
Judging by past experience, it is very likely that I’ve averted Mayuri’s death for today. But just in case, I should get back to the lab within the hour.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako, do you remember breaking an old computer in the shrine storehouse last year?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“An old computer? No, I don’t remember anything like that.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I don’t really understand computers. I haven’t played with them much.”[%p]
When Lukako was a girl, she trembled when I asked her the same question.[%p]
And then she forced a smile, as if to avoid admitting that she broke the computer.[%p]
But he’s not trembling now.[%p]
Lukako honestly doesn’t know.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Go get your father for me.”[%p]
I ask Lukako to fetch his father for me, so I can ask him whether or not the IBN 5100 was in the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“An old computer... yes, I do remember.”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“I’ll go check. Please wait a moment.”[%p]
He heads into the storeroom out back, just like on the previous worldline.[%p]
But on the previous worldline, the IBN 5100 was no longer in the storehouse, since girl Lukako had secretly moved it.[%p]
How will it turn out this time?[%p]
Luka’s dad returns after about 10 minutes. His expression is grave.[%p]
That’s all the answer I need.[%p]
Nothing has changed.[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“It’s gone. I couldn’t find it anywhere.”[%p]
I quickly glance at Lukako’s face.[%p]
Blank. He doesn’t seem to know anything.[%p]
Lukako is innocent. I’m sure of it.[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“The lock to the storehouse was broken. Someone may have stolen it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stolen it?”[%p]
It didn’t disappear?[%p]
A thief took it?[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“There’s evidence someone dragged something heavy away. That wasn’t there at the end-of-the-year cleaning, and the lock wasn’t broken when I checked last month.”[%p]
[name]Luka’s Father[line]“I never expected a thief would break in.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Then shouldn’t we report it to the police?”[%p]
While they discuss what to do, I sigh and consider the situation.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This isn’t going to work.”[%p]
The IBN 5100 is still out of reach.[%p]
There are two D-Mails left to cancel. Something tells me that if I cancel just one more, I can get back the IBN 5100.[%p]
But which one?[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um, Okabe-san. I don’t really understand, but please don’t be sad.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“J-just go ’It matters not!’ like you always do.”[%p]
I chuckle.[%p]
Lukako’s so adorable when he’s trying to cheer me up.[%p]
But he’s a guy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re using that phrase wrong, you know.”[%p]
I wave goodbye and leave the shrine.[%p]
