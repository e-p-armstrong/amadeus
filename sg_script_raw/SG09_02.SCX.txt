Two D-Mails remain.[%p]
First, the one I sent to myself with the winning LOTO SIX numbers.[%p]
That one should be easy to cancel.[%p]
The problem is the other one, the one sent by someone I wish I could forget.[%p]
Kiryu Moeka.[%p]
I know the gist of her D-Mail, since she sent it as part of our early experiments.[%p]
When Moeka asked to send a D-Mail, I agreed under two conditions.[%p]
First, make the contents simple enough that the D-Mail’s effects would be obvious.[%p]
Second, make the contents public to all lab mems.[%p]
Moeka ended up sending a D-Mail to prevent herself from buying a new phone a few days prior.[%p]
The D-Mail was sent to July 31st, an easy date to remember.[%p]
The question is how it relates to the theft of the IBN 5100.[%p]
It must be the Butterfly Effect, as it was with Lukako’s D-Mail.[%p]
This time, however, I will not hesitate to do what is necessary.[%p]
Kiryu Moeka does not deserve my sympathy.[%p]
That woman and her men have killed Mayuri more times than I can bear to remember.[%p]
I will show her no mercy.[%p]
There’s just one problem.[%p]
The cancellation D-Mail needs to be sent from Moeka’s own phone.[%p]
I don’t think a message from me telling her not to change phones would sway Moeka’s intentions in the slightest.[%p]
I need her phone, but I don’t know where to find her.[%p]
What do I do?[%p]
I return to the lab and set things up so I can time leap at a moment’s notice. [%p]
Fortunately, that isn’t necessary.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Phew. I’m stuffed! I barely ate today, so I was hungry!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Is there more tomorrow?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah, and the day after, too.”[%p]
Mayuri just got back from ComiMa 30 minutes ago. She and Kurisu, who stayed behind at the lab, have just finished eating cup noodles.[%p]
It’s already past 8, and so far, nothing has happened.[%p]
Mayuri is still alive.[%p]
Going by the pattern, her death has probably been postponed until about this time tomorrow.[%p]
Is this the will of some higher being? God, fate, the universe itself?[%p]
Or is it merely coincidence?[%p]
That doesn’t matter now.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okeydokey! Mayushii’s got an early day tomorrow, so I’m going home.”[%p]
Mayuri takes a big stretch and starts getting ready to go home.[%p]
She’s been up since five this morning. Looks like she plans to wake up early tomorrow, too.[%p]
That reminds me. I haven’t seen Daru at all. He’s fighting in the ComiMa Holy War too, so that doesn’t surprise me. Busy checking his spoils, I guess.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey guys, why don’t you come too?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll pass, but my assistant looks like she wants to go.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What!?”[%p]
Kurisu jumps up at my answer.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey! Don’t put words in my mouth!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I saw your eyes sparkling while you listened to Mayuri’s cosplay stories.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Maybe, but nobody said anything about going.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Come on, Chris-chan!”[%p]
I know that Kurisu is an @channeler, but is she an otaku?[%p]
Not all @channelers are otaku, but she has often hinted at an interest in cosplay.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No way. I’d suffocate in a crowd like that.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s not as crowded on day two! If you’re worried, come in the afternoon. All the popular stuff will be sold out, though.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You go, Okabe. You’re Mayuri’s guardian, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“No, Mayushii is Okarin’s hostage!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh, right. That’s what it was.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well you don’t want your hostage to escape, do you? Shouldn’t you take her along in handcuffs or something?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve got business in Akiba.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What do you mean, business?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
The search for Kiryu Moeka.[%p]
I already sent her an email -- “We need to talk.” -- and now I’m awaiting her reply.[%p]
Something tells me it’s not going to work.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No answer? I guess it was just an excuse.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Christina. We need to talk.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Again? Abrupt as usual.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hm? What do you mean, again?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Nothing.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Whatcha gonna talk about?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You two have been really close lately, huh? You’re always talking together.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii really wants to join in your secret meetings and stuff.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry. We’ve been talking about the Time Leap Machine. It would just be gibberish to you.”[%p]
Not entirely accurate, but not a lie either.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Besides, the purpose of this particular discussion is to convince Christina to attend ComiMa. Prepare for good news, Mayuri! Muhahaha!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, great! Thanks, Okarin.”[%p]
Mayuri waits in the lab as I take Kurisu outside.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, Christina.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m not going to ComiMa.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You said ’again’ just now. We’ve talked like this before, just the two of us?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Losing your memory now? Does our little mad scientist have an [color index="820000"]acetylcholine[color index="800000"] deficiency?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m being serious.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re acting weird today. What’s going on?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please. I need to know.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I mean, yeah. This is like the fifth time you’ve brought me outside to talk about the Time Leap Machine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have we talked about my time leaping?”[%p]
For an instant, Kurisu opens her eyes wide in surprise.[%p]
But then, she gives me an angry glare.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re time leaping?”[%p]
I nod.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“More than a dozen times already.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That many!? What the hell are you doing!?”[%p]
Hmm... Looks like she doesn’t know anything about Lukako or my shifting between worldlines.[%p]
But that’s only natural.[%p]
So far, I’ve changed worldlines a total of three times. Let’s call the first worldline where Mayuri died “Alpha 1.”[%p]
The worldline where Faris and I fought the Viral Attackers is Alpha 2.[%p]
The worldline where I dated girl Lukako is Alpha 3.[%p]
And now I’m on Alpha 4.[%p]
From my perspective, Alpha 1, Alpha 2, and Alpha 3 were undone by my D-Mails.[%p]
But for Kurisu and everyone else on Alpha 4, those worldlines were nothing but separate, intangible possibilities to begin with.[%p]
I guess I have to explain everything again.[%p]
I sigh heavily, then begin.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I think I get it.”[%p]
After I’m done, Kurisu sighs and lightly pats my arm.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t wear yourself out.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s a disgrace to be comforted by my assistant.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why are you always like that!? I’m even trying to be nice. You’re really full of yourself, you know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t need your sympathy. Everything that happened is my fault. I’m just getting what I deserve.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Come to think of it, every time I explain this to you, I always end up hating myself in the end.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry about me. Worry about Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri will probably die tomorrow. I don’t know how it will happen.”[%p]
If Mayuri stays away from the lab, she can probably avoid running into Moeka and her men. It doesn’t matter, though. She’ll die all the same.[%p]
All Alpha worldlines converge on her death. Escaping the attractor field is the only way to save her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry about this, but I want you to be there when she dies tomorrow night.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s why you want me to go to ComiMa?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s nothing we can do to prevent her death. Just stay close and tell me when it happens.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Once I know, I’ll make the time leap.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I can’t believe there’s nothing we can do.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It just doesn’t feel real. But it’s the truth, isn’t it? I can see it in your eyes.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Are you okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No. I still haven’t saved Mayu--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I know. That’s not what I meant.”[%p]
Kurisu interrupts me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are [color index="A0140000"]you[color index="800000"] okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t follow.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re carrying an awful burden.”[%p]
It’s rare for her to look so concerned for me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I told you not to worry about me. It’s Mayuri you need to worry about.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Tomorrow, I’m going to look for Moeka.”[%p]
If Mayuri doesn’t die tomorrow, I can postpone the time leap.[%p]
If Mayuri does die tomorrow, I’ll return to the past no matter what.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I wish there were some way that Mayuri wouldn’t have to suffer...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then why don’t you time leap now?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t plan effectively without knowing the deadline.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t want to see Mayuri die either, you know.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know how you feel, but you’re the only one I can ask.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Where did all this trust come from?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...You’re my assistant, after all.”[%p]
Kurisu forces a laugh at my feeble attempt at a joke.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re so full of yourself.”[%p]
We have our plan.[%p]
Kurisu will go to her first ComiMa.[%p]
Mayuri will be so delighted when I tell her the news.[%p]
I haven’t seen Mayuri all day.[%p]
I want to be with her, of course, but that’s not possible.[%p]
Moeka hasn’t replied, which means I have to find her myself.[%p]
Unfortunately, I don’t know anything about her.[%p]
My only clue is Arc Rewrite, the company Moeka supposedly worked at.[%p]
I find it after a quick search online.[%p]
Sure enough, their business is producing articles for PC magazines.[%p]
Luckily, their office is in Akiba.[%p]
I try calling first, but it goes to voice mail.[%p]
I guess they’re still closed for the Obon holiday.[%p]
Or maybe it’s just a bad time?[%p]
Looks like I’ve got no choice but to visit them in person.[%p]
It’s the second day of ComiMa and Akiba is deserted. Most of the otaku are lined up at Big Sight right now.[%p]
I’ve experienced the craze of ComiMa several times firsthand. It’s literal war.[%p]
It scares me whenever Mayuri goes alone. I can’t help but imagine her trampled by a horde of crazed otaku.[%p]
But in reality, Mayuri’s surprisingly quick and tough. I’ve seen her weave through crowds like you wouldn’t believe.[%p]
Kurisu’s the one more likely to get trampled.[%p]
I can’t help but feel sorry for her. Maybe it was wrong to ask her to go.[%p]
I find the Arc Rewrite office in a fancy-looking building on the outskirts of Akiba.[%p]
I take the elevator up, but there’s nobody there. I lean against the wall and wait.[%p]
After about thirty minutes, a man dressed in shirt and tie appears. I explain that I’m a relative of Kiryu Moeka and ask for her contact info.[%p]
But he gives an unexpected answer.[%p]
[name]Male Staff-Member[line]“We don’t have an employee by that name.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You... don’t?”[%p]
Damn! I’ve been tricked![%p]
I should have known better. Moeka is working for SERN. Of course her place of employment is fake.[%p]
Is this the end of the line?[%p]
Just as I’m about to turn around and leave, the man pounds his hand as if he remembered something.[%p]
[name]Male Staff-Member[line]“Wait a second. There was a girl who worked here just two days before disappearing. I think her name might’ve been Kiryu.”[%p]
[name]Male Staff-Member[line]“We might still have her resume.”[%p]
I frantically bow my head and ask him to look for it. He’s reluctant, but acquiesces.[%p]
The address listed on the resume leads me to a beat-up old apartment.[%p]
Not the sort of place you’d expect a single young woman to live.[%p]
I feel a strange unease as I approach the apartment.[%p]
For some reason, there’s a police car parked in front of the complex.[%p]
A uniformed officer is standing out front.[%p]
And one room on the second floor -- room 202, Moeka’s -- has a blue sheet covering the door.[%p]
What’s going on here?[%p]
I walk up to the police officer.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Excuse me. Did the person who lives there move?”[%p]
[name]Officer[line]“Huh? No.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then...?”[%p]
[name]Officer[line]“Are you related?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I knew her.”[%p]
[name]Officer[line]“You haven’t heard?”[%p]
The police officer looks uncomfortable.[%p]
The bad feeling in my gut is getting worse.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What happened?”[%p]
[name]Officer[line]“Suicide.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What...?”[%p]
Suicide?[%p]
But... why?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When!?”[%p]
[name]Officer[line]“Yesterday.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No way...”[%p]
[name]Officer[line]“They took her to Chiyoda Third Central Hospital. Doesn’t look like she had any relatives. We don’t know who to notify. Will you go see the body?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I bow my thanks and leave.[%p]
She’s dead?[%p]
Moeka’s dead?[%p]
What’s going on? It doesn’t make sense.[%p]
Suicide?[%p]
Moeka... who killed Mayuri in cold blood... committed suicide?[%p]
Or is this part of the conspiracy?[%p]
Could her own men have killed her, then made it look like a suicide?[%p]
Today is the 16th.[%p]
On worldline Alpha 1, Moeka raided the lab on the 13th.[%p]
Three days have passed since then.[%p]
Each time I change worldlines, Mayuri’s death gets pushed back one day. So does Moeka’s raid.[%p]
It hasn’t happened yet on this worldline.[%p]
So why did she die?[%p]
I don’t get it.[%p]
This is the first time this has happened.[%p]
How should I deal with this?[%p]
What should I do?[%p]
I squat on the ground and cradle my head in confusion.[%p]
If Moeka is dead, maybe Mayuri doesn’t have to die.[%p]
...No. I don’t think convergence is that kind.[%p]
Fate demands Mayuri’s death.[%p]
Whenever I try to stop it, [color index="A0140000"]something[color index="800000"] interferes.[%p]
True, I’m the one who meddled with the timeline, but haven’t I paid the price already?[%p]
How did all this happen?[%p]
A few weeks ago, I was just a college student with a severe case of chuunibyou.[%p]
Save for Mayuri’s grandmother, I had never experienced the death of anyone close to me.[%p]
Death had no place in my life.[%p]
But how many times have I faced death these past three days -- more, when you count the loops I’ve made?[%p]
My heart can’t take it anymore.[%p]
I don’t know how much longer I can go on.[%p]
One more.[%p]
Just one more D-Mail to cancel.[%p]
If I can just get my hands on Moeka’s phone...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Time leap...”[%p]
Moeka died yesterday around noon.[%p]
I can go back to before that happened.[%p]
The reason she died isn’t important. Whether Mayuri’s murderer kills herself is of no concern to me.[%p]
I just need to cancel that D-Mail![%p]
