Upon returning to the lab, I casually look up at the second floor window.[%p]
And what I see shocks me to my core.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Electrical discharge!?”[%p]
Someone is using the Time Leap Machine![%p]
Who!?[%p]
Mayuri and Daru should be at ComiMa.[%p]
Not even Kurisu should be here. I asked her to escort Mayuri yesterday.[%p]
Besides, she’s against changing the past.[%p]
So who!?[%p]
The building shakes.[%p]
The vibration reaches the street.[%p]
I can’t let this happen. The timeline mustn’t be tampered with again![%p]
I need to stop it now![%p]
I race up the stairs to the lab.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
By the time I get there, the shaking has stopped.[%p]
I quietly peek into the development room.[%p]
Nobody’s there.[%p]
The door was unlocked. Anyone could have walked right in.[%p]
How could we be so careless?[%p]
The Time Leap Machine is still faintly warm.[%p]
So somebody did use it.[%p]
Who?[%p]
Did they time leap?[%p]
This is the first time someone else has used the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
Just to make sure, I check the X68000.[%p]
As expected, the history’s been erased. The same thing happens when we send a D-Mail.[%p]
...There’s nothing I can do about this.[%p]
It worries me, but I have to focus on Moeka.[%p]
I set up the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
The maximum leap time is 48 hours. To leap more than that, you need to leap 48 hours and then leap again.[%p]
The 42-inch CRT is on downstairs.[%p]
That’s plain as day, since the discharge phenomenon just occurred.[%p]
I put on the headgear.[%p]
Preparations complete.[%p]
...Should I really leap now?[%p]
Don’t be ridiculous. Of course I should.[%p]
Just a little more, and I can save Mayuri once and for all.[%p]
I know what will happen if I don’t leap now.[%p]
Mayuri will die, and I will taste that pain and despair once again.[%p]
And then, I will leap. It’s the same either way.[%p]
...I close my phone.[%p]
There’s no need to rush. Calm down.[%p]
I can endure the pain, if need be.[%p]
I should exploit my one advantage, the Time Leap Machine, to the fullest extent possible, and that means knowing exactly when Mayuri will die.[%p]
The pattern suggests that Mayuri’s death should happen around 7 or 8 tonight.[%p]
But things are a little different this time. Moeka killed herself before Mayuri was scheduled to die.[%p]
How much influence will that have on convergence?[%p]
There’s a chance Mayuri won’t die. We might already have won.[%p]
In that case, I shouldn’t waste my effort time leaping.[%p]
I have no obligation to save Moeka.[%p]
I’ll wait until Kurisu contacts me.[%p]
It’s 12:30 now. There are still about 7 hours left.[%p]
I hear nothing but the slow, steady tick of the clock.[%p]
The sound is echoing inside my head. Even if I plug my ears, it doesn’t stop.[%p]
I spent several hours searching for the IBN 5100, but as expected, I found nothing.[%p]
I still can’t imagine how Moeka’s D-Mail affected the computer’s whereabouts. What does her phone model have to do with anything?[%p]
Does keeping the same phone somehow tell her that there’s an IBN 5100 at Yanabayashi Shrine?[%p]
That doesn’t make sense.[%p]
Even the Butterfly Effect must have limits.[%p]
But on the other hand, truth is often stranger than fiction. Sometimes the simplest things have consequences that no one could ever imagine.[%p]
So I can’t rule it out entirely either.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In other words... I have nothing.”[%p]
I twist my lips into a sneer of self-mockery.[%p]
It’s 7:46 PM, the moment of truth.[%p]
If Mayuri is indeed fated to die today, I should be hearing from Kurisu soon.[%p]
I hope nothing happens.[%p]
All that I ask is to hear Mayuri’s voice -- to know, once and for all, that she is safe.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
An artificial melody cuts through the silence of the lab.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hello!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okabe! She’s... aah... why... I don’t...”[%p]
Kurisu is sobbing.[%p]
So I know. Even without asking.[%p]
She saw Mayuri die.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“She just... I saw it happen! She’s dead! Mayuri’s dead! This... this can’t be...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“She s-suddenly collapsed. Why!? It doesn’t make sense. She’s not breathing. She won’t answer at all. Please, Mayuri!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okabe, what should I... what do I do? Help! Please! Mayuri’s dead!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I’m sorry for making you go through this.”[%p]
With that, I hang up the phone.[%p]
Maybe it’s because I didn’t see it happen, or maybe my heart has simply grown numb.[%p]
But this time, I don’t feel much pain.[%p]
I hate myself for it.[%p]
I pound my fist against the table.[%p]
My phone is ringing.[%p]
There’s only one thing that can mean.[%p]
Mayuri is dead.[%p]
For all my wishful thinking, I never really doubted this was going to happen.[%p]
There’s no need to confirm what I already know.[%p]
Just as I thought, Mayuri is doomed to die on this worldline.[%p]
Silently, I apologize to Kurisu for forcing her to watch it happen.[%p]
As expected, the deadline is around 8 PM on the 16th.[%p]
Unless I change the worldline before the time limit, Mayuri will die.[%p]
I put on the headgear and activate the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
I must obtain Moeka’s phone, no matter what it takes![%p]
I make several consecutive leaps to travel back to the 11th.[%p]
When I arrive, it’s just past 8 PM.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m heading out.”[%p]
I leave the lab without waiting for the others to respond.[%p]
Suddenly, the empty room is full of familiar faces.[%p]
Mayuri is sitting on the sofa, working on her costumes and rubbing her tired eyes.[%p]
Daru is at his PC, muttering to himself.[%p]
Kurisu is in the development room, tinkering with the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
Where is Moeka now?[%p]
Should I try going to her apartment again?[%p]
Honestly, I’m afraid to meet her face to face. I don’t know what I might do.[%p]
That woman killed Mayuri.[%p]
Innocent Mayuri, sewing with all she’s got...[%p]
I’ve seen the blood drain from her body.[%p]
I’ve seen the light fade from her eyes.[%p]
If I see Moeka, will I be able to contain my rage?[%p]
...It doesn’t matter. I can’t run away.[%p]
In order to save Mayuri, I must meet with Moeka.[%p]
