I head to Moeka’s ratty apartment. There’s no sign of the police this time.[%p]
Moeka’s suicide won’t happen for another four days.[%p]
I run up the iron stairs and stand in front of the door to unit 202.[%p]
The lights aren’t on inside.[%p]
I start getting anxious. Maybe she’s not here.[%p]
There’s no intercom, so I reluctantly knock on the door.[%p]
No reply. I try again with the same result.[%p]
Damn. Might as well try the doorknob.[%p]
It’s unlocked.[%p]
I take a deep breath.[%p]
This could be a trap. Remember, we’re not dealing with an ordinary person. Moeka is a Rounder, an agent of SERN.[%p]
If I die here, what will happen to Mayuri?[%p]
Will Kurisu or Daru use the Time Leap Machine to save her?[%p]
I need to be careful.[%p]
But at the same time, I can’t save Mayuri by doing nothing.[%p]
So I steel myself, open the door, and peek inside.[%p]
The apartment is dark, too dark to see.[%p]
But I feel someone’s presence.[%p]
I step inside.[%p]
The apartment is practically empty.[%p]
Minimal furnishings.[%p]
Only the barest necessities of life.[%p]
But there, by the window, is a figure in the moonlight.[%p]
A woman is sitting on the floor, her head bowed.[%p]
There’s no one else here.[%p]
I approach the woman and stare down at her, gritting my teeth in a desperate effort to maintain control.[%p]
Ever since the first time she killed Mayuri, I’ve tried my best to avoid thinking about this woman.[%p]
But now, I have no choice.[%p]
I can’t accomplish my goal until I have the answers I need from her.[%p]
I must obtain the IBN 5100 to escape the Alpha attractor field and rescue Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Kiryu Moeka.”[%p]
I had another name for her once. It hurts to remember. I force it to the back of my mind.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you hear me?”[%p]
Moeka’s fingers twitch.[%p]
She sluggishly lifts her head.[%p]
But she doesn’t look up. She stares at my feet instead.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Who?”[%p]
She finally speaks in a frail voice.[%p]
Moeka has always had trouble speaking, but it seems especially severe today.[%p]
I notice her hair and clothes are disheveled. She looks awful, though I suppose that’s no surprise, given that she kills herself in four days.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...FB? Is it you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“FB?”[%p]
I’ve heard that name before.[%p]
If I’m not mistaken, that’s her superior’s codename.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Why won’t you contact me? I did everything you told me to.”[%p]
The phone in Moeka’s hands glows faintly.[%p]
She’s still clinging to it, I see.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Did I do something wrong? I’ll fix it, I promise. Just don’t abandon me. I’ll do anything for you, FB.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Please, answer me. Give me orders. I’ll obey. Tell me what to do... tell me... tell me...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“uugh... uugh...”[%p]
I’m at a loss for words.[%p]
I wasn’t expecting to find her in such a miserable state.[%p]
She was so cold, so calm when she killed Mayuri.[%p]
It’s like she’s a different person now.[%p]
Is this another effect of the worldline change?[%p]
But it’s only been a week since she sent her D-Mail. How could she have changed so much?[%p]
I get on my knees and shake Moeka by the shoulders.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, can you hear me? Hey!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“FB... why... why won’t you answer...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kiryu Moeka! Hey! It’s me! Okabe!”[%p]
No response.[%p]
Moeka just keeps crying and mumbling to herself.[%p]
I shake harder, but she doesn’t react. She doesn’t even resist.[%p]
Looking down, I notice that she’s typing rapidly on her phone.[%p]
Bewildered, I look at the screen.[%p]
FBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFB[linebreak]FBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFBFB[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What the...”[%p]
What happened to Moeka?[%p]
From what little I understand, it sounds like she’s lost contact with her supervisor, FB.[%p]
But I don’t understand how that could turn Moeka into such a wreck.[%p]
...It doesn’t matter. I don’t care what happens to her.[%p]
I’m here for one thing.[%p]
Recalling my purpose, I reach for Moeka’s phone.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“No!”[%p]
A sharp crack echoes through the room.[%p]
Moeka slapped my hand away.[%p]
It didn’t hurt, but her reaction was lightning quick.[%p]
Now Moeka curls up into a ball, hugging the phone tightly to her chest.[%p]
It was like this from the moment I met her. She never let go of her phone, not even for a second, as if it were the only thing keeping her alive.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...No mails.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“No mails...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...You mean from FB?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...No mails.”[%p]
I make several more attempts to take her phone while she babbles incoherently, but she just slaps my hand away each time.[%p]
Next, I try persuasion. I promise to help her search for FB if she lends me her phone.[%p]
It’s a lie, of course, though come to think of it, I would like a piece of FB, too.[%p]
But that can wait until after I’ve saved Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...uugh...”[%p]
But Moeka doesn’t buy it. If, that is, she heard me at all.[%p]
Dammit. We’re not getting anywhere.[%p]
Maybe I should take it from her by force.[%p]
But what if she tries to kill me before I can send the D-Mail?[%p]
In her current state, she might not have the strength to retaliate.[%p]
On the other hand, if she does retaliate, there’s not much I can do against someone with a gun.[%p]
What should I do?[%p]
Her gun...[%p]
Where would she keep it?[%p]
I quickly scan the room, but there’s no sign of it.[%p]
Crap! That startled me.[%p]
Could she have picked a worse time?[%p]
I try again, this time asking nicely to borrow her phone.[%p]
Moeka doesn’t reply. She’s staring at her phone.[%p]
As she realizes that it’s not her phone ringing, I see fresh tears pool in her eyes. She hangs her head.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Why won’t you respond, FB? You’re the one who recruited me...”[%p]
Moeka starts typing yet another mail.[%p]
I guess she really doesn’t recognize me.[%p]
This is frustrating.[%p]
Why is she acting like the victim here?[%p]
Does she think she’s a tragic heroine? Does she think she deserves sympathy?[%p]
You don’t have the right to be so weak.[%p]
It’s Mayuri who deserves sympathy, not you.[%p]
She died countless times because of you![%p]
Murderer.[%p]
I swallow the word before it passes my lips.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Dammit.”[%p]
I check my phone. It’s Kurisu calling.[%p]
I stand up and move to the entrance, where I can take the call without letting Moeka out of my sight.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hello?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Finally.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Where are you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hello.”[%p]
I stand up and move to the entrance, where I can take the call without letting Moeka out of my sight.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Where are you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Sorry, I’m busy.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Is it woman? You’re with a woman, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is that the first thing that comes to mind? You really are a mainstream girl.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Shut up.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“You promised you’d help with the PhoneWave, remember? Or is your lab mem number just for show?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Get Daru to help. I can’t do it today.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“...What [color index="A0140000"]are[color index="800000"] [color index="8A0000"]you doing? Where are you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kiryu Moeka’s apartment.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“So you are with a woman. You’re the worst.”[%p]
Has she not met Moeka on this worldline?[%p]
I quickly give Kurisu a simplified version of the usual explanation.[%p]
Kurisu listens attentively, as she always does.[%p]
Maybe she’s more considerate than I give her credit for.[%p]
As soon as I finish, Kurisu gives it to me straight.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“You have to take it from her by force.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’ve seen too many Hollywood movies.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“You’re up against an agent of SERN. Play nice and you could end up dead.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Don’t hesitate. Remember you’re doing this to save Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“I know you’re pretty weak and scrawny, but you should be able to handle her in her current state.”[%p]
Gee, thanks. At least she’s not beating around the bush.[%p]
Suddenly, she lowers her voice.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“You might think I’m a monster for saying this... not that I care what you think, but...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Kill her if you have to.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re a monster.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But you’re not a hypocrite, and that’s what I love about you, Christina.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“L-love!? Uh...”[%p]
What’s the matter with her now?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I mean it. I wish my conviction were as strong as yours.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“...Well, thanks.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But that’s not all, right? There’s a reason you’re willing to suggest murder as an option. How did you reach that conclusion?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Good, you’re still thinking.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“I can’t be certain whether your story is true, and I don’t quite understand this attractor field hypothesis.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“But based on what you told me...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“If this Kiryu woman commits suicide four days from now, then that means her death flag is already active.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“In other words, this worldline has approved her death.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“On previous worldlines where that wasn’t the case, you probably couldn’t have killed her even if you tried. Something would have happened to prevent it.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Or possibly, killing her would have caused a dramatic shift in worldline divergence.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“But on this specific worldline, her death is already certain.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“As you’ve experienced with Mayuri’s death, the result is what matters, not the process.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“I believe the same applies to Kiryu. It doesn’t matter how she dies.”[%p]
In other words, I can kill her instead of letting her commit suicide?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She’s already going to die, so that makes it okay. That the kind of argument a murderer would make.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Don’t be a hypocrite. We’re not talking about right and wrong here, Okabe.”[%p]
She’s unforgiving as always, but it actually feels nice to speak frankly like this.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But what about the law? Even if fate forgives me, society won’t.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“As long as you have the Time Leap Machine, you can undo anything, even murder.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“The result will be that you gained the necessary information without killing anybody.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I understand.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“...Phew. Just remember one thing. You’re responsible for what you do.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“...I guess that’s quite a thing for me to say, huh? After telling you to kill her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s fine. Your advice was truly becoming of a mad scientist.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Get it done, Okabe. Bye.”[%p]
She hangs up without another word.[%p]
Strangely, I find Kurisu’s harsh tone encouraging.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who does she think she is, a general?”[%p]
I manage a smirk as I close my phone.[%p]
Moeka’s still sitting on the floor.[%p]
“Kill her if you have to,” Kurisu said.[%p]
Moeka did the same to us. She doesn’t deserve mercy.[%p]
Kill her or let her live. It’s my choice, my responsibility.[%p]
Even after I undo the murder, the memory of my crime will remain with me.[%p]
That sin -- that guilt -- I’ll have to carry that weight. I mustn’t ever forget.[%p]
That’s what Kurisu meant when she spoke of responsibility.[%p]
Murder is unforgivable, no matter the circumstances.[%p]
Can you understand that, Kiryu Moeka?[%p]
I reach for Moeka’s phone. This time, there’s no hesitation.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“N-no...!”[%p]
Moeka resists.[%p]
I grab her slender hand and pin it to the window.[%p]
The glass rattles from the force, but thankfully doesn’t break.[%p]
With my other hand, I pry the phone away from Moeka’s chest.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Goh...!”[%p]
She drives her foot straight into my solar plexus.[%p]
The breath explodes from my lungs. I gasp for air.[%p]
In a fit of anger, I raise my hand to strike.[%p]
But at the last moment, I hesitate.[%p]
Damn. What happened to killing her if I have to!?[%p]
I know we’re past the point of playing nice, but I’ve never hit a girl in my life.[%p]
I don’t consider myself a model gentleman or anything, but the idea that men aren’t supposed to hit women is such a strong part of my ’common sense’ that it stayed my hand almost like instinct.[%p]
So instead, I wrap my hand around Moeka’s neck and squeeze.[%p]
When she tries to kick me again, I pin her legs under my own.[%p]
I squeeze harder. My fingers dig into her throat.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Gah...hah...”[%p]
She struggles for breath.[%p]
I feel her throat moving as she gasps for air.[%p]
I can finally see my reflection in her tear-reddened eyes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now I have your attention!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Hhh, hhhh, gh, haah, hhhh...”[%p]
Moeka is under control, but now I don’t have a free hand to take her phone.[%p]
If I loosen my grip on her throat even slightly, it’ll turn into a struggle again.[%p]
Moeka is hiding her phone behind her back now.[%p]
I need that phone. Should I let go of her hand or her neck?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Give me your phone!”[%p]
Moeka weakly shakes her head.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you don’t, I’ll kill you!”[%p]
I wonder if I even can.[%p]
I can undo it with the Time Leap Machine. It’ll be the perfect crime, one that never happened.[%p]
But still, do I really have it in me to murder someone?[%p]
I don’t know, but I have to try.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hand it over or I’ll kill you!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Haah, khah, haah, kpph, haah...”[%p]
No words leave Moeka’s lips. Just rough breathing.[%p]
Stalemate.[%p]
Neither of us shows the other any openings.[%p]
We’re practically motionless, but our breathing is ragged.[%p]
It’s taking all my strength just to pin her down.[%p]
Our rough breathing echoes through the room. For a moment, it even seems to synchronize.[%p]
This is getting me nowhere.[%p]
I remove my hand from her neck, then use my entire left arm to pin her against the wall in a guillotine choke.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Guh, hgg, gah, hah, geh...!”[%p]
She starts groaning in pain.[%p]
My right hand has her left hand up against the glass. Now I pull her hand down and transfer it to the grip of my left hand.[%p]
Now my right hand is free. I slide it behind her back and go searching for her phone.[%p]
I have to lean in close to do this. I press my body up against hers.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Guh!”[%p]
Pain explodes in my jaw. I lean back.[%p]
Moeka is readying another headbutt.[%p]
I put more strength into the guillotine choke to stop her.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Ah... gah...!”[%p]
Moeka’s face twists in pain and she struggles to escape my grasp.[%p]
My guillotine choke seems to be working. She doesn’t have the strength to resist.[%p]
If I push any harder, she really might die.[%p]
I push harder.[%p]
Moeka writhes in pain. Tears fall from her eyes and drool from her mouth.[%p]
As her resistance weakens, my right hand finds Moeka’s phone.[%p]
She still has it in a tight grip, but I manage to tear it away.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Gehh, gehhehuggehgehoh--”[%p]
I quickly release Moeka and step away.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Gehohgehohgehoh, khah, ga... beh.. gh...”[%p]
She bends over and coughs violently. But still she reaches out to me with tears in her eyes.[%p]
She wants her phone back. I don’t care.[%p]
I look at the screen.[%p]
It shows an email draft with a string of FBs entered.[%p]
I clear the text and start typing a new mail.[%p]
But her phone’s different from mine, so I don’t quite know how to use it.[%p]
Let’s see...[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Gehohgehoh, bi...na...”[%p]
Startled, I look up to see Moeka staggering to her feet.[%p]
She’s like a goddamn zombie.[%p]
I quickly run outside and close the door behind me.[%p]
Then I lean my entire body weight onto it so she can’t open it from the inside.[%p]
The doorknob rattles as she tries to open the door.[%p]
Then she starts pounding on the inside.[%p]
It’s a good thing doors in Japan open out. You wouldn’t see this in a Hollywood movie.[%p]
Anyway, I have her phone.[%p]
Now I just need to pretend to be Moeka, and send the cancellation D-Mail.[%p]
Moeka’s changes to the past will be canceled. The worldline will change.[%p]
The IBN 5100 will come back to me.[%p]
And then we’ll hack into SERN. Mission Complete.[%p]
Fate won’t have Mayuri this time! Victory will be mine![%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“This is Makise.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Get ready for a D-Mail!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okay, but what’s that noise!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m having a little trouble here.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“So you didn’t kill her. Good job!”[%p]
I tell her Moeka’s address.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“It’s ready.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And Mayuri?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Still here. She’s at the Braun Tube Workshop trying to get the manager to turn on the CRT.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You didn’t tell her anything, did you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“About her death? Of course not.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Good. Don’t hang up yet.”[%p]
I put my phone down and resume typing into Moeka’s phone.[%p]
A middle aged lady comes out of the apartment next door.[%p]
Our eyes meet, so I put on a forced smile.[%p]
The lady grins mockingly before going back inside.[%p]
I wonder what she was thinking. Maybe she thought it was a lover’s quarrel.[%p]
In the mail, I write “Model changeDo it now!!!B4 sold out!”[%p]
Moeka’s D-Mail said “Don’t change models.”[%p]
The desire for limited edition, hard-to-find products is hard-coded into Japanese DNA. Appealing to that instinct should work.[%p]
The insistent pounding on the door grows louder.[%p]
And now I hear groaning from the other side.[%p]
I can’t believe how persistent she is. Is her phone really that important to her?[%p]
But I’ve already won.[%p]
All I have to do is send the D-Mail.[%p]
I’ll never forgive you, Moeka, but at least our relationship ends here.[%p]
Let this be the last time we meet.[%p]
I raise the phone to eye level.[%p]
I take a deep breath.[%p]
It ends now.[%p]
I press Send.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
No vertigo. No dizziness. Nothing.[%p]
Reading Steiner didn’t activate.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? Why?”[%p]
Why didn’t the worldline change?[%p]
Did the PhoneWave fail to function?[%p]
I bring my own phone back to my ear. Kurisu is still on the line.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Did you send it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes. Did it work!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“The discharge is occurring as normal.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So it worked, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Definitely.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The worldline didn’t change!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“You mean it failed? Why?”[%p]
Consider the possibilities.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe the message wasn’t enough to persuade Moeka to change models.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Could we have sent it to the wrong date?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s July 31st. I’m sure of it.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Check when the original D-Mail arrived. Maybe her reaction will change if the new one arrives just after that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What a pain!”[%p]
The pounding on the door has ceased.[%p]
Did she finally give up?[%p]
No, she wouldn’t give up.[%p]
Does she plan to climb out the window and loop around?[%p]
But we’re on the second floor. That would be quite a feat.[%p]
I should still have some time left.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Try sending different messages.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“If that doesn’t work, I’ll adjust the timer.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re a lifesaver. What’s going on there? Is Mister Braun freaking out?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“I can hear him shouting from below. Hashida and Mayuri are trying to calm him down, but who knows how long that’ll last.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“I don’t think there’s much time left.”[%p]
I put my phone into my pocket without hanging up.[%p]
I change the message and send another D-Mail.[%p]
...But still, nothing happens.[%p]
I make another one. Send.[%p]
...No good.[%p]
Why? What am I doing wrong?[%p]
I’d like to ask Moeka, but if I go back inside now, she’ll probably just attack me.[%p]
Which reminds me, she’s been awfully quiet. What is she doing now?[%p]
Maybe she really did go out the window.[%p]
I look around. I don’t see her anywhere.[%p]
Think. Why didn’t the D-Mail work?[%p]
I wipe the sweat from my brow. My entire body is soaked. It must be the adrenaline.[%p]
What if Moeka changed addresses when she got a new phone?[%p]
I take out my phone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you there?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Still not working?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I tried two more times, but nothing.”[%p]
I frantically consider my options as I stare hard at Moeka’s phone.[%p]
The walkway is dim, but Moeka’s gaudy purple phone shines in the faint light.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Wait.[%p]
I take another good look at the phone.[%p]
There’s something wrong here.[%p]
What is it?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okabe? What’s wrong?”[%p]
Gaudy purple.[%p]
Latest model.[%p]
Removable LCD screen.[%p]
Model number GG01.[%p]
My eyes tell me there’s nothing wrong.[%p]
I saw this phone when Moeka sent her D-Mail, and many times before. She was never without it.[%p]
It’s the same. Nothing has changed.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nothing... changed?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Huh? What hasn’t changed?”[%p]
Why hasn’t it changed?[%p]
Why is it the same as before Moeka sent her D-Mail?[%p]
Moeka’s D-Mail said “don’t change models.” She should have had a different phone when she sent it.[%p]
But she didn’t. It was the same phone I’m holding right now.[%p]
There’s only one explanation. She never changed models to begin with.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No way...”[%p]
She lied to me![%p]
Moeka’s D-Mail wasn’t about her phone![%p]
That explains how it affected the IBN 5100. It also explains why my cancellation D-Mails aren’t working.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That sneaky little...!”[%p]
The door violently shakes behind my back.[%p]
It’s much stronger than before. She must be ramming something hard and heavy against the door.[%p]
I quickly move away from the door.[%p]
The door shakes again. I can see the frame starting to warp.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She’s crazy!”[%p]
I suppose I should be thankful she doesn’t have a gun, but honestly, this is terrifying enough.[%p]
It chills my blood to think of what her face must look like now.[%p]
I’ve never been the target of such single-minded obsession before.[%p]
But unfortunately, I can’t run away.[%p]
I need to face Moeka again and wring the information out of her.[%p]
Both Faris and Lukako remembered their D-Mails.[%p]
With prodding, Moeka will remember too.[%p]
I need that information.[%p]
Crap...[%p]
I don’t want to go in there.[%p]
My teeth are chattering. This is pathetic.[%p]
I thought I’d won when I snatched her phone![%p]
But now my advantage is gone.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okabe! Okabe!? Answer me!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Christina.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“What’s that pounding? Are you okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Moeka’s D-Mail wasn’t about a model exchange.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“What do you mean!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She must have changed the text right before we sent it. That’s why the cancellation mails aren’t working.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Did you check her history? It might still be there.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Her arrival history...”[%p]
Of course! Even if it’s not in her sent history, it should still be in the arrival history.[%p]
I glare at the purple phone in my hand.[%p]
It’s a good thing Moeka didn’t change phones. Now I know exactly where the D-Mail went.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I should have thought of that. Checking now!”[%p]
For a second there, I thought it would be easy. I should have known better.[%p]
Moeka is not a casual phone user.[%p]
Her mailbox has literally hundreds of entries over the last week, almost all from FB.[%p]
Some of my mails are sprinkled in.[%p]
I don’t have time to search through each of these mails, even just the subject lines.[%p]
Not to mention the pounding on the door is freaking me out.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Christina, I seem to be in a spot of trouble. If I fail, I’m leaving the rest to you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Don’t be ridiculous! If you’re in trouble, then get out of--”[%p]
I hang up.[%p]
The lady next door comes out again, alarmed by the escalating noise.[%p]
She glares at me.[%p]
But when she sees the magnitude of the door’s damage, the lady opens her eyes in shock and runs back inside.[%p]
I’m not leaning against the door anymore. Moeka could just open it, but she hasn’t realized that. She’s so fixated on getting her phone back, she’d destroy her own door.[%p]
In any case, I don’t have time to check her mail history.[%p]
I put the phones into my pockets and move to the side of the door.[%p]
