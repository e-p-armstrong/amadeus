I carefully grip the doorknob and wait for the interval between bangs.[%p]
Now.[%p]
I yank the door open.[%p]
A coffee table flies out and smashes into the walkway railing.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Okabeeeee!”[%p]
Her screech raises hairs all over my body.[%p]
She’s standing in the entrance like a revenant at the gates of hell.[%p]
I step back.[%p]
My knees tremble.[%p]
But then I remember what I’m here to do.[%p]
I gather my resolve, enter the room, and close the door behind me.[%p]
Or at least I try. The door’s bent, and won’t fully close.[%p]
I give up on locking it.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Give it back!”[%p]
Moeka glares at me, shaking with fury.[%p]
First, I have to restrain her again.[%p]
This is a woman who would kill on command, who would break her own door down just to retrieve her phone.[%p]
It’s too dangerous to let her be.[%p]
I’m stronger. I just need to get her on the ground.[%p]
There’s no time. It’s now or never![%p]
Crushing my fear, I charge Moeka at full speed.[%p]
Our bodies collide.[%p]
Moeka tries to twist away, but I grab her clothes and use my momentum to push her to the floor.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Augh!”[%p]
The back of her head hits the floor.[%p]
Her resistance weakens.[%p]
She doesn’t know how to break a fall. Some secret agent![%p]
I quickly straddle her waist. Now she’s mine![%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Give it baaack!”[%p]
Moeka flails her arms and legs wildly.[%p]
I should have known she wouldn’t give up.[%p]
Her fist strikes my jaw.[%p]
Fortunately, Moeka is weak. The blow does little damage.[%p]
I still need to stop her from struggling.[%p]
First, her hands.[%p]
I start with her left.[%p]
I grab her wrist and pin it to the floor.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
A fist flies towards my face.[%p]
It pops against my left eye, blanking my vision for a second.[%p]
She seems to stop struggling for a moment.[%p]
Her hand claws weakly at the air.[%p]
But it turns out that she was reaching for my hair.[%p]
She grabs it hard. I feel several strands tear free of my scalp.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Guh!”[%p]
I get a grip on Moeka’s face and press her head against the floor.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Haah, khaah, haah...”[%p]
She tries to bite my fingers, so I pull my hand back.[%p]
I grab the hand that’s grabbing my hair and dig my nails into her wrist.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Ah... agg... ggeh...!”[%p]
But she still doesn’t let go of my hair.[%p]
All the while, her feet are pounding against my back.[%p]
She’s also trying to free her left hand.[%p]
I can’t take much more of this.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why you!”[%p]
I instinctively headbutt Moeka with all my strength.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Guh!”[%p]
The sickening sound of bone against bone echoes inside my head.[%p]
The impact makes me dizzy too, but I fight it.[%p]
Moeka goes limp. An opening. Finally, I succeed at pinning down both her hands.[%p]
Her glasses fell off at some point during the struggle.[%p]
Her red, swollen eyes give her an even more demented look.[%p]
There’s an angry bump on her forehead where I headbutted her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Haah, khah, haah...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Uh... khuh... huuh... gh... uh...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That hurt, you crazy bitch!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...ph!”[%p]
She spits at me.[%p]
The lukewarm saliva hits my face.[%p]
Ugh.[%p]
I want to wipe it off, but my hands are full.[%p]
Moeka glares at me. There are tears in her eyes, perhaps from the pain.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Eye contact... good... we’re making progress...”[%p]
Moeka breaks eye contact when I mention it.[%p]
She stares at my pocket.[%p]
She must have caught a glimpse of purple.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not giving it back.”[%p]
I smile scornfully.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not letting you escape into your own little world again. You don’t have that right.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Give it back!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Come and get it!”[%p]
Moeka tries again to free her hands. I lean in harder to keep them pinned.[%p]
My strength and position are superior, so Moeka accomplishes nothing.[%p]
Next, she struggles to free her body. Same result.[%p]
I clamp my thighs firmly around her hips and hold her down.[%p]
She occasionally knees me in the back, but I can bear that pain.[%p]
It’s not enough to make me forfeit this position.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can keep this up as long as I have to.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who’s going to tire out first?”[%p]
Moeka, without a doubt.[%p]
I don’t do sports or anything, so I’m not that strong.[%p]
But I’m on top. I don’t need to expend much energy to keep her pinned.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Why did you take it!?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Give it back! Give it baaack!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Keep screaming.”[%p]
She can scream and spit all she likes. Nothing will make me give up this position.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t care about your phone issues. I don’t care about FB.”[%p]
Moeka shakes her head violently.[%p]
She’s just wasting her energy.[%p]
I maintain position and stare down at Moeka.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You don’t kill her on this worldline, and the worldlines where you did have already been erased.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I remember! I remember everything you did! Everything that never happened!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll never forget that you killed Mayuri! And I’ll never forgive you!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So there’s no escape for you today. We’re gonna stay here as long as it takes.”[%p]
Until now, I’ve always run away from facing Moeka.[%p]
But I can’t do that on this worldline.[%p]
I have to know what her D-Mail said.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So let’s be honest with each other, huh?”[%p]
Moeka is still struggling.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Give it back! Give it baack!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Give it back! I’ll kill you! I’ll fucking kill you!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Let... me... go!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’ll tear... your fucking... eyes out!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So you can talk without your phone. I’m impressed.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You piece of shit! I’ll gut you with a kitchen knife!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m a mad scientist. Dissection is my specialty.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Die! Die! Help! I’m being raped!”[%p]
This woman’s out of control![%p]
Does she want another headbutt that badly?[%p]
A knock sounds from the door.[%p]
Moeka and I both look at the door in surprise.[%p]
[name]Nishida[line]“Hello? This is Nishida from next door. Is everything okay?”[%p]
[name]Nishida[line]“Do you need the police? If not, then could you please keep it down?”[%p]
[name]Nishida[line]“The walls here are pretty thin.”[%p]
Damn, I didn’t think about that.[%p]
I can’t have her calling the police.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“He’s going to kill me!”[%p]
Moeka suddenly screams.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“No! Stop it! Don’t kill me!”[%p]
You bitch![%p]
What now!? I need to silence Moeka somehow.[%p]
But I can’t use either hand.[%p]
There’s only one way![%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Call the pol--nnuh!?”[%p]
I suddenly press my lips against Moeka’s.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Mmm...gh...nn...”[%p]
My loveless kiss shuts her up quite effectively.[%p]
I lock eyes with her as well, trading glares in silence.[%p]
[name]Nishida[line]“Kids these days...”[%p]
I finally hear the neighbor’s footsteps recede.[%p]
What a relief.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Pwah!”[%p]
I feel a sharp pain on my lip. I instinctively jerk away.[%p]
Blood drips from my mouth and lands on Moeka’s neck.[%p]
She bit me![%p]
When I feel around my lip with the tip of my tongue, the taste of blood spreads out from the laceration.[%p]
Moeka breathes wildly as she glares at me with tearful eyes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t act like it’s your first time. You’re older than me, remember?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Haah... haah... kh...”[%p]
She grimaces and looks away.[%p]
Her pink lips glisten with saliva. I might find the sight alluring if the situation were different.[%p]
Moeka turns her face away and looks up, through the open curtains, at the bright full moon outside the window.[%p]
How much time has passed?[%p]
It feels like it’s already been dozens of hours.[%p]
But it’s still night outside, so it probably hasn’t been more than one or two.[%p]
Moeka hasn’t said a word since I kissed her.[%p]
She hasn’t tried to escape either. Her expression is blank. She’s just staring off to the side.[%p]
What is she looking at? I follow her gaze, but the only thing there is a half-empty bottle of water.[%p]
Has she given up?[%p]
Either way, I can’t let my guard down.[%p]
Maybe it’s the stress, but it feels like my body is going numb.[%p]
And I’ve been drenched in sweat for a while now.[%p]
This room has no air conditioning whatsoever. The heat is starting to get to me.[%p]
I thought I had an overwhelming advantage in this position, but it’s harder to maintain than I expected.[%p]
Not only do I have to keep Moeka pinned, I also have to keep a close eye on her so she doesn’t try anything.[%p]
All Moeka has to do is lie there. She can rest and try again whenever she’s ready.[%p]
Will this last all night?[%p]
At this rate, my strength might give out first.[%p]
Fear mounts. If she escapes, she’s going to try to kill me. She must have her gun somewhere, I’m sure.[%p]
I consider calling Kurisu for help, but I can’t use either hand, and I don’t even know what time it is.[%p]
Damn, it’s almost like I’m the one trapped![%p]
No. Stay positive.[%p]
You can do this.[%p]
Moeka’s dependent on her phone. That’s her weak point.[%p]
If I keep her separated from her phone, then sooner or later, her will to resist should collapse.[%p]
It’s a matter of whose strength will fail first.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Oka... Okabe...kun...”[%p]
Suddenly, Moeka calls my name.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“What... do I have... to do?”[%p]
Now she’s trying to ask nicely. Does this mean she’s given up?[%p]
This is what I was waiting for. Now I move in for the kill.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you remember sending a D-Mail?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“A D... what?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“D-Mail. An email that you send to the past.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You sent one to your own phone.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You led me to think it was about a phone model exchange, but you changed the text before you sent it.”[%p]
Her typing speed is lightning fast. It would have been easy for her to type a mere 36 characters while Daru and I were preoccupied with the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your D-Mail changed the past.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t you remember?”[%p]
Normally, once the past changes, everything until that point is undone.[%p]
But it should be possible to make Moeka remember, just as Faris and Lukako did.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I... don’t know.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You do know. You just haven’t remembered yet.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Remember. Remember, or else.”[%p]
Or else what, I don’t know.[%p]
This is just a tactic to put pressure on Moeka. I have another plan to make her remember.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka turns away again and bites her lip. Tears start falling from her eyes.[%p]
I watch, never once taking my eyes off her.[%p]
I didn’t notice before now, but her shirt must have become undone during the struggle.[%p]
I can see the alluring curves of her collarbone, the skin of her large, pale breasts, a hint of sexy underwear.[%p]
Her breasts heave with each painful breath.[%p]
The base of her neck is stained with the blood from my lip.[%p]
It’s dry, like a scab.[%p]
Normally, Moeka could be mistaken for an elegant, beautiful woman.[%p]
But now she has large shadows under her eyes. Her skin is rough. Her face is pale.[%p]
She looks more intoxicated than intoxicating.[%p]
Her entire body reeks of death.[%p]
She’s clearly insane.[%p]
This is the real Moeka. I wish I’d realized sooner.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I really... don’t know.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“If I could remember... I would...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“But I don’t... remember anything.”[%p]
Moeka’s gaze shifts constantly, from me to the ceiling and then to the window.[%p]
But her slow murmuring is evidence that she’s almost beat.[%p]
Just a little more, and her resistance will end.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Fine. I’ll change the question.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You received a strange email about two weeks ago.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It came from your own number, and it was dated several days in the future.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...!”[%p]
Moeka’s eyes open wide.[%p]
Gotcha.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You remember? Good. That was the D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What did it say?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“If I tell you...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll return your phone.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Fuck... you...”[%p]
She suddenly curses at me.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I won’t... tell you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why not!?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“It’s... my mission.”[%p]
Her mission?[%p]
I recall what Moeka told me on a previous worldline.[%p]
The Rounders’ mission is to find and acquire IBN 5100s.[%p]
In that case...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“!!”[%p]
She fell into my trap. Her reflexive response was all I needed to see.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It was about the IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“How much... do you know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m asking the questions here. Just answer.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I... can’t.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I won’t... betray... FB.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So you’re choosing FB over your phone? How loyal.”[%p]
But Mayuri’s fate hangs in the balance. I can’t give up.[%p]
Moeka still hasn’t calmed down.[%p]
She’s been opening and closing her hands for a while now.[%p]
She’s not trying to escape my restraint. She’s just twisting her body.[%p]
Licking her lips. Shaking her head, trying to brush the hair off her face.[%p]
It’s like she’s suffering from withdrawal without her phone.[%p]
Soon, she won’t have the mental fortitude to resist.[%p]
If she won’t talk now, then I’ll just wait until she will.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is it really that painful to not have your phone? Why are you so dependent on it?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I can’t... talk to people.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re talking right now, aren’t you?”[%p]
And when she attacked the lab, she was leading a squad of hardened killers.[%p]
But Moeka shakes her head violently.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“If I can’t... use mail... then I’ll be...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Cut off... from the world.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? Are you fishing for sympathy? You’re just afraid of being abandoned by the Rounders, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“No... not the Rounders... FB.”[%p]
That’s the same thing, isn’t it?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then don’t say ’the world.’ You’re the one who killed an innocent girl. You’re the one who erased Mayuri from the world!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...I didn’t kill her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Not on this worldline, maybe. But on another worldline, you came to steal our time machine. You killed her. You killed Mayuri!”[%p]
On the worldline where I interrogated Moeka, she told me that Mayuri was expendable.[%p]
It didn’t matter to SERN whether she lived or died.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“If FB told me to... then yes... I killed her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who is FB? Where the hell is he?”[%p]
I asked her the same question back then, but another Rounder appeared before she could answer.[%p]
Something tells me she won’t have backup this time. Moeka’s position in the Rounders has changed.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I can’t... tell you...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then let me tell you something.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Listen good. If you’re holding out for backup, you can forget it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nobody’s coming to save you. The pain and despair are just going to get worse, and in four days, you’ll kill yourself.”[%p]
Moeka seems startled by this. I go in for the kill.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I came here from the future, using the time machine SERN wants so badly. That’s how I know.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You kill yourself in this room, all alone.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your precious FB doesn’t save you. No one does. Not the Rounders, not SERN, and not the Committee of 300.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your boss hasn’t replied to your mails, has he? You know why?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Because you’ve been abandoned.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka’s face contorts in despair.[%p]
Once again, tears fall from her eyes.[%p]
Guilt squeezes my heart. I know that I’m causing this woman pain.[%p]
Inside of me, a voice whispers that it’s nothing compared to what she did to Mayuri, that I have no reason to show mercy to a murderer.[%p]
But at the same time, my conscience screams that it’s wrong to hurt someone, no matter who they are or what they’ve done.[%p]
Insane mad scientist, my ass. I’m afraid to hurt my mortal enemy.[%p]
I’m nothing but a hypocrite.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“FB doesn’t deserve your loyalty. Tell me everything.”[%p]
I ignore the ache in my heart and push harder.[%p]
But Moeka shakes her head violently.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“FB wouldn’t betray me... FB wouldn’t abandon me!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then why do you kill yourself in four days?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You kill me... and make it look like a suicide...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I wouldn’t need to cover it up if I killed you. I’d just undo your death with my time machine.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When I got here, you were sitting in the corner like a limp rag, crying about how FB wouldn’t answer. Remember?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“But...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How many days has it been? How often did FB contact you before, and when did it stop?”[%p]
I keep the questions coming. Need to pile on the pressure.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“It used to be... every day...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“But it’s already been... ten days...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ten days with no contact. Correct?”[%p]
Moeka looks up to me with pleading eyes.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I won’t... betray... FB...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“FB betrayed you.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I believe in FB...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“He threw you away.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“FB used you, and now your usefulness has ended.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“FB isn’t... like that...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then what sort of person was he?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“She was gentle... to me... like a mother...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I finally had... a place I belonged!”[%p]
Like a mother!?[%p]
FB is a woman?[%p]
I expected an evil-looking old man like you see in the movies, but I guess I was wrong.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’d talk to her about my worries... she always replied right away...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Like a friend... but gentle... accepting...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you met her?”[%p]
Moeka shakes her head weakly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You haven’t met? Even though she’s like your mother? Your friend?”[%p]
Damn. If they had met, then I could’ve gotten Moeka to lead me to her.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Rounders... must hide... their identities from one another...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So you’ve talked, but you’ve never met. But you must have wanted to meet her, right? Even if it was against the rules.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“No... no!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“It would ruin everything... if she saw the real me...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did she ever say she wanted to meet you?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“No... never... and I never asked...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So no phone calls either, then?”[%p]
Moeka turns away. Then she nods faintly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Didn’t you wonder why?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why would such a kind, gentle woman refuse to meet you in person? Was it really just the rules?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And why isn’t she returning your emails now? Think about it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She was using you. You were tricked.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Don’t say that! She’s not... like that!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What did her last email say before she stopped contacting you?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...’Leave the IBN 5100 at the designated location.’”[%p]
The IBN 5100? Moeka, you fool, you let your tongue slip![%p]
Two weeks ago, FB told her to leave the IBN 5100 at a drop point. That means she already had it in her possession at that time.[%p]
I recall how Moeka kept bombarding me with questions about the IBN 5100. I might have let it slip that I found the computer at Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
After that, she sent her D-Mail.[%p]
The worldline changed.[%p]
The lock was broken on the shrine’s storehouse door.[%p]
The IBN 5100 was gone.[%p]
These facts point to one conclusion.[%p]
She sent herself the location of the IBN 5100![%p]
Now that I know, it seems so obvious.[%p]
If only I hadn’t trusted Moeka. If only I had seen through her lies.[%p]
But no, I played right into her hands. I was the tool’s tool.[%p]
I almost burst into self-deriding laughter.[%p]
But I desperately hold it back, and keep a straight face.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What was the designated location?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“The coin locker... in front of Daibiru...”[%p]
The coin locker in front of Daibiru...[%p]
Wait, isn’t that where Lukako hid the IBN 5100 on the previous worldline?[%p]
Is this another effect of convergence?[%p]
Can I retrieve the IBN 5100 if I go there now?[%p]
No, I can’t expect it to still be there.[%p]
Remember what happened with Lukako.[%p]
The invisible force of convergence is keeping the IBN 5100 away from me.[%p]
If I want to get it back, I need to cancel Moeka’s D-Mail.[%p]
I know the message. I’ve already reached my goal.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“*sob*...”[%p]
Moeka starts crying softly.[%p]
I sigh deeply and lift myself off Moeka’s body.[%p]
Then I lean back against the wall and stretch my aching limbs.[%p]
