I take Moeka’s phone out of my pocket.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m using your phone.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka slowly gets up. She wipes her tears and fixes her hair and clothes.[%p]
Her wavy hair obscures her face from this angle, so I can’t make out her expression.[%p]
She doesn’t react to what I said.[%p]
Even though I’m no longer restraining her, she doesn’t try to attack me and take back her phone.[%p]
I open Moeka’s mailbox and search for the D-Mail.[%p]
It takes about three minutes, but I finally find it.[%p]
Three mails from Moeka’s own phone, each 12 characters long, sent on August 4th and received on July 31st.[%p]
“RetroPC’s at” “Yanabayashi” “Shrine”[%p]
Just as I suspected. Moeka changed her D-Mail in the few seconds I had my back turned.[%p]
All I need to do now is send the cancellation mail.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okabe!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You at the lab?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Haah... don’t worry me like that... idiot...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What, were you worried about me?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“I-I mean, you set off an obvious death flag. I’m surprised you’re still alive!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where are you now?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“I’m standing by at the lab.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Set up the machine. I’m sending another D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Destination?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...July 31st, 11 AM.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“11 AM on the 31st...”[%p]
While Kurisu calculates the hours, I type the mail.[%p]
It says “Do NOT go!! ” “Not @shrine!” “It’s a trap!”[%p]
I address the mail to the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okay, all set.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alright, activate it.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Activated.”[%p]
I press the send button.[%p]
The mail starts sending.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Reading Steiner should activate. This time for sure.[%p]
I brace myself for the incoming vertigo.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“...Well?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nothing. Why won’t it change!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Another mistake?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, there’s no way! I know what Moeka’s message said. This D-Mail should have canceled it.”[%p]
Why isn’t it working?[%p]
What the hell’s wrong this time?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“What did the first D-Mail say?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That the IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine. I tried to cancel it by telling her it’s a trap, but it didn’t work.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll try to phrase it differently.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Wait. We went through this with the LOTO SIX experiment, remember?”[%p]
The LOTO SIX experiment...[%p]
I sent myself the winning numbers, but the past me didn’t buy the ticket. Instead, he gave the winning numbers to Lukako.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“The person who reads the D-Mail chooses whether or not to act accordingly.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Kiryu learned that the IBN 5100 was at the shrine. Though the cancellation mail came right afterward, I guess she ignored it and went anyway.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe she didn’t believe the cancellation mail. Or maybe she was so diligent she decided to check it out even when told not to.”[%p]
I glance at Moeka.[%p]
She’s still hanging her head, but her tears have run dry.[%p]
I wonder if she’s listening.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Damn. Even when told it was too risky to go to the shrine, she went anyway...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We need a more persuasive message. Something that will prevent her from going to the shrine.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Like what?”[%p]
That’s the problem.[%p]
Is it possible to persuade her with just 36 bytes of text?[%p]
Or should we consider other possibilities?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What if I send a D-Mail to myself on July 30th? Could I beat her to the IBN 5100?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Were you even interested in the IBN 5100 then?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
When did I start caring about the IBN 5100?[%p]
I can’t remember.[%p]
Fine. That’s out. So how do I convince Moeka to listen?[%p]
At that moment, an electric shock runs through my brain.[%p]
Two initials.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...FB.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“What?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Moeka’s handler. She’s obsessed with FB. If the mail comes from FB, she’ll do whatever it says.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Do you have FB’s phone?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No. They haven’t even met. We don’t know where FB is.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Then there’s nothing we can do.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Give me a little time.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Gonna make me wait again? Well, I’ve been pulling all-nighters recently, so whatever.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line][color index="8A0000"]“Just don’t do anything stupid, okay?”[%p]
So even after prying answers out of Moeka, there’s still more work to be done.[%p]
Fate really seems to love getting in my way.[%p]
Alright. To break out of this worldline, I need FB’s identity and location.[%p]
I call Moeka’s name. When she finally looks up, I drop her phone onto her lap.[%p]
She accepts it with a confused expression.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Looks like we’re searching for FB now.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka grips her phone. But she doesn’t look at the screen.[%p]
I sigh deeply.[%p]
I need to get as much information on FB out of her as I can.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How exactly did you become a Rounder?”[%p]
Honestly, I couldn’t care less.[%p]
I hate having to stand here and talk with the woman who killed Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Hugging her phone to her chest, Moeka retrieves her glasses and puts them back on.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Four years ago... I tried... to kill myself.”[%p]
Her voice is a barely audible whisper.[%p]
For a moment, I’m surprised she’s not talking by mail.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I had... no hope. I wanted to get away... from everything.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...No big reason.”[%p]
Her expression is blank, lifeless, like always.[%p]
But behind her glasses, her eyes are red from crying.[%p]
They are the only trace of emotion on her doll-like face.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Little things... lots of little things... piled up.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’ve always been... like this.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And your family?”[%p]
Moeka shakes her head a little.[%p]
She has none, I guess.[%p]
I don’t bother asking whether she ever had parents. It doesn’t really matter.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I locked myself in my room... and overdosed on sleeping pills.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“But I didn’t die.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Afterwards... I got a mail.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Recruiting Rounders, it said... It was sent to hundreds of people... not just me.”[%p]
...Isn’t that spam?[%p]
Do the Rounders really recruit like that?[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Nothing mattered anymore... so on a whim... I replied.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“And then... FB contacted me.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Ever since... I’ve followed... FB’s orders.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Were you always stationed in Akiba?”[%p]
Moeka shakes her head.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Until three months ago... I was in Nagoya. Before that... Yokohama. Before that...”[%p]
The Rounders’ chief duty is to acquire IBN 5100s. I guess they had her traveling all over Japan, digging up info on retro PCs.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How many IBN 5100s have you found so far?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Not even one...”[%p]
No results? It sounds like SERN is spending a lot of effort for not much return.[%p]
I sigh deeply once again.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So what now? Are you going to sit here, wallowing in despair, until you kill yourself four days from now?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Or do you want to rebel against fate?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Rebel?”[%p]
Even as I ask the question, I know that for her, rebellion is impossible.[%p]
This worldline has already approved her death.[%p]
She’s in the same situation as Mayuri. No matter what she does, she will die.[%p]
I know that, and yet I ask the question.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“FB used you and threw you away. Accept it. And then ask yourself what you’re going to do about it.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka looks down.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Even if FB... did use me...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“That... was the only place... I belonged.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“That was the first time... in my entire life... that I was needed.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“FB gave me... purpose.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“To protect that purpose... to protect FB...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I would do... anything.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re beyond hope.”[%p]
I stand up.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Drown in your dependence for all I care. Your death has already been decided.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I won’t let fate have its way. I’m rebelling to the end.”[%p]
No matter what, I will save Mayuri.[%p]
Just a little bit more. I can’t give up now![%p]
