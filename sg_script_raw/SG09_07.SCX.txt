It’s midnight, and Akiba is practically empty. The silence is eerie.[%p]
There’s no sign of anyone near the coin locker.[%p]
Considering the IBN 5100’s size, it couldn’t fit in the regular-sized lockers.[%p]
She must have put it in one of the three large lockers on the right.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The light’s on!”[%p]
The bottom locker is still in use.[%p]
Is the IBN 5100 inside?[%p]
My heart starts pounding in my chest. I feel my face grow hot with excitement.[%p]
We’ve been apart for far too long, my partner, but now only a thin locker door separates us.[%p]
Is this what love feels like?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Let’s not go crazy.”[%p]
I force myself to consider the situation calmly.[%p]
Is the IBN 5100 really inside?[%p]
I want to check right this instant. I can’t believe I forgot to ask Moeka which locker she used.[%p]
Should I get a crowbar or something to pry the locker open?[%p]
If the IBN 5100 really is inside, and I steal it, what will happen to the worldline?[%p]
I have yet to cancel all of the D-Mails, which I thought was the only way to restore the original worldline.[%p]
But now the IBN 5100’s so close. Why can’t I just reach out and take it?[%p]
I know how to cancel Moeka’s D-Mail, so I can always do that if this doesn’t work.[%p]
Let’s try it, just to make sure.[%p]
First, I make a quick visit to the lab.[%p]
Ignoring the complaints of the lab mems, who stayed awake in the lab all night, I retrieve a makeshift crowbar from the development room.[%p]
Then I return to the lockers and thrust the pointed tip of the crowbar into the crack of the door.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!?”[%p]
Just as I begin to pry, a shrill siren shatters the night.[%p]
I look up to see the red lights of a patrol car coming this way.[%p]
Their timing couldn’t be worse![%p]
The police release me after about thirty minutes of scolding.[%p]
I return to the coin locker and try to pry it open again. Immediately, another patrol car appears. This time, they take me to the police station.[%p]
I’m stuck in an interrogation room all night, getting preached to by policemen. I conclude that this is another effect of attractor field convergence.[%p]
No matter what I do, I cannot obtain an IBN 5100 on this worldline. That is what fate has decreed.[%p]
I get the police to call my father, and they finally release me.[%p]
They didn’t go so far as to arrest me, but the policemen, as well as my father, scold me harshly.[%p]
I act apologetic, but in actuality, their words fall on deaf ears.[%p]
After my father goes home, I head straight to Moeka’s apartment.[%p]
I tried calling her -- I took the opportunity to memorize her phone number yesterday -- but she wouldn’t pick up at all.[%p]
Before I get there, I send a mail to Daru asking him to check if the coin locker is still occupied.[%p]
The door to Moeka’s apartment is unlocked.[%p]
I find Moeka hugging her knees in the corner, just like she was when I first found her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You put the IBN 5100 in the bottom-right locker. Correct?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...How?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Out of all the lockers, only three could hold the IBN 5100. Out of those three, only the bottom one was in use.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If that’s the one you used, then FB hasn’t picked it up yet.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you know what that means?”[%p]
Moeka frowns.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It means that if we stake out the locker, you’ll get to meet FB.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...ah.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It hadn’t occurred to you? Some secret agent you are.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m headed there now. You coming?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“What will you do... if you meet her?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Borrow her phone.”[%p]
That’s the best way to prevent Moeka from going to Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I can’t meet her... I’m too afraid. The real me could never... live up to her expectations...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Something tells me her expectations were never that high to begin with.”[%p]
Moeka’s face contorts again.[%p]
I’m being blunt. Not only because Moeka is Mayuri’s murderer, but also because Moeka’s weakness is starting to get on my nerves.[%p]
Just like Daru’s mail said, the locker is still occupied when I get there.[%p]
I look around to make sure there are no patrol cars.[%p]
No crowbars this time. I don’t feel like getting arrested.[%p]
I head across the street to Daibiru, hide behind one of its humongous pillars, and begin the stakeout.[%p]
My legs are getting tired.[%p]
I was going to borrow Mayuri’s portable game console, but I decided I didn’t need the distraction.[%p]
Still, it’s pretty tough to keep standing like this. I also need to stay inconspicuous.[%p]
Someone might notice if they see me standing in the same place for hours.[%p]
I wouldn’t want a security guard to give me trouble.[%p]
I mean, I guess there’s not much worry about that. I’ve already been here for seven hours without incident.[%p]
My legs are numb, so I squat and lean against the pillar.[%p]
So hungry...[%p]
I’d love to go get some food, but I can’t take my eyes off the locker.[%p]
Just then, somebody taps me on the shoulder.[%p]
FB!?[%p]
I try to leap to my feet, but my legs get tangled and I fall over.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka is standing there, looking down at me with those glassy eyes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing here?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’ll... keep watch too.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Is that... okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Why the change of heart?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
I stand up and dust off my clothes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You were comfortable with your mail-only relationship, weren’t you? I thought you wanted to maintain that distance.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So what made you decide to risk a meeting?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“At this rate...”[%p]
Moeka puts her head on her knees. She looks ready to cry.[%p]
I’ve seen that expression once before, in her moonlit apartment.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“If I lose contact with FB... I’ll lose... my connection...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“To the world?”[%p]
Moeka nods faintly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can’t bear to be alone yourself, yet you’d end an innocent girl’s life because some person you’ve never met told you to.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A cultist, that’s what you are.”[%p]
And her cult leader, FB, abused her weakness before throwing her out like old clothes.[%p]
...It pisses me off.[%p]
FB’s cruelty. Moeka’s weakness. I can’t decide which I hate more.[%p]
Then, Moeka nervously brings out a convenience store bag.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s this?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Instead of answering, Moeka looks away.[%p]
I look inside.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whoa! Milk and bean buns!”[%p]
Exactly what you need on a stakeout.[%p]
There’s enough for two.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You brought this for me?”[%p]
Moeka nods.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Very well. You may join the stakeout.”[%p]
Now we can take turns watching, and we’ll also look less suspicious to passersby.[%p]
The night draws on, and still no sign of FB.[%p]
We nap in one hour shifts, but it doesn’t help the exhaustion.[%p]
On top of that, I don’t have anyone to talk to -- Moeka can’t keep a conversation going -- so there’s nothing I can do to stave off boredom.[%p]
I went back to the lab to shower just before dawn, but Kurisu, who was working an all-nighter on the Time Leap Machine, just glared at me.[%p]
The wait finally ends at just after 1 PM on the 13th.[%p]
Someone comes to open the lower-right locker.[%p]
We watch from behind the pillar.[%p]
It’s a nondescript middle-aged man.[%p]
He’s dressed in a new suit, but it hangs rather poorly on him, as if he’s not used to wearing it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is that FB?”[%p]
Moeka shakes her head firmly.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“FB... is a woman.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So... maybe she hired someone to pick it up.”[%p]
Or it could be someone from the locker company here to clear it after weeks overdue.[%p]
That would make us all idiots. Moeka, FB, and me.[%p]
The man has the key to the locker.[%p]
He pays the late fee with 100 yen coins, then removes the cardboard box with the IBN 5100 inside.[%p]
The man thought ahead and brought a pushcart.[%p]
He puts the IBN 5100 onto the pushcart with a bit of effort, and begins walking away.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Follow him!”[%p]
The man heads straight for Akihabara Station.[%p]
Strangely enough, he walks up to an overweight man standing in front of the ticket machine.[%p]
The overweight man is wearing a T-shirt and has all the signs of an otaku. He doesn’t seem to have anything in common with the first guy, who looks like an average salaryman.[%p]
They transfer the IBN 5100 into the overweight man’s suitcase.[%p]
After they exchange a few words, the overweight man enters the station alone. Then the guy in the suit leaves.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Weird.”[%p]
What was the purpose of that transfer?[%p]
Is the overweight man FB? Or is he just another link in some kind of chain?[%p]
At any rate, if we keep following the IBN 5100, we should reach FB eventually.[%p]
We enter the station.[%p]
The overweight man boards the Yamanote line. We board on the next car and keep watch through the connecting door.[%p]
It’s a weekday afternoon, so there aren’t many passengers.[%p]
Thirty minutes later, we arrive at Shinjuku Station.[%p]
Here, the train sees a sharp increase in passenger traffic.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“He’s getting off...”[%p]
Moeka pulls on my sleeve.[%p]
The overweight man has slipped into the stream of departing passengers. He’s about to exit onto the platform.[%p]
We follow him, but due to our slow reaction, we have to push our way through the boarding passengers.[%p]
The train doors close, and it slowly departs.[%p]
The man starts walking towards the exit.[%p]
Shinjuku is crowded, so we have to follow close behind or we’ll lose him.[%p]
But then I stop in my tracks.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...!?”[%p]
The man is empty-handed.[%p]
His suitcase is missing.[%p]
What?[%p]
For a second, I think we followed the wrong man, but no, it’s definitely him.[%p]
We watched him the whole time he was on the train.[%p]
There’s no doubt he had the suitcase when the train arrived in Shinjuku.[%p]
Could he have passed it to someone else in this crowd?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Clever...”[%p]
They know how to lose a tail.[%p]
I return to the lab and leap an hour back.[%p]
I find myself inside the train.[%p]
I know it’s bad manners to use my phone on the train, but this is an emergency.[%p]
According to the train’s display, we’re about to leave Otsuka for Ikebukuro. Three stops to Shinjuku.[%p]
Moeka is next to me, acting inconspicuous.[%p]
I peek at the overweight man in the next car.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They’ll make their move at Shinjuku.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That guy’s gonna get off, but he actually hands the package to someone else.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“He got us good just now.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Just now?”[%p]
Doesn’t look like Moeka’s caught on yet.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I just time leaped from an hour in the future.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Time... leaped?”[%p]
Moeka’s eyes widen.[%p]
The train arrives at Shinjuku on schedule.[%p]
Just to make sure, I’ll have Moeka follow the man when he gets off.[%p]
Before the doors open, I stealthily move to his car.[%p]
He still has the suitcase with the IBN 5100.[%p]
[name]Station Announcer[line]“Now arriving at Shinjuku.”[%p]
The doors open and passengers spew out.[%p]
The overweight man leaves too, just like last time. However...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I knew it!”[%p]
He leaves the suitcase on the train.[%p]
And now, passengers from Shinjuku board.[%p]
Someone walks up to the abandoned suitcase. It’s a woman in her 30s pushing a baby stroller.[%p]
There’s no baby.[%p]
The woman casually loads the suitcase into her stroller and sits down.[%p]
After witnessing that scene, I return to the neighboring car.[%p]
I need to be careful. These guys are serious about avoiding pursuit.[%p]
The train starts moving.[%p]
I contact Moeka so we can regroup later.[%p]
After that incident, the package swaps couriers like a hot potato, snaking around the tracks that run through Tokyo like a web.[%p]
Whenever they give me the slip, I time leap and resume the chase.[%p]
Finally, the courier and package get aboard the Hibiya Line and return to Akihabara Station, where it all began.[%p]
I recognize the last courier.[%p]
He’s one of the men who raided the lab with Moeka.[%p]
Dark skin. Crew cut. The one who hit me with his gun.[%p]
The man easily carries the 25-kilo package out of the station. We follow.[%p]
A car honks its horn.[%p]
Moeka and I immediately hide.[%p]
Peering out from cover, I see a white flatbed parked in front of the station.[%p]
A muscular man hops out of the driver’s seat.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...”[%p]
I know that face.[%p]
No. It can’t be![%p]
I desperately try to organize my thoughts.[%p]
That’s... Tennouji Yuugo, owner of the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
Mister Braun.[%p]
Why?[%p]
Why is he here?[%p]
Does this mean he’s connected to FB? To the Rounders?[%p]
Was the Braun Tube Workshop just a front for SERN? Is that how he could afford to keep it open?[%p]
What’s going on here!?[%p]
His shop is right below the lab. If he’s working for the enemy, then...[%p]
I shiver at the thought.[%p]
Stop. Let’s not rush to conclusions. He might just be another courier.[%p]
We watch from a distance. Tennouji takes the suitcase from the crew-cut man and loads it into the back seat of his car. Then he gets into the car alone and takes off toward Showa-dori.[%p]
I stare after it in disbelief.[%p]
I time leap several hours to before the first man arrived at the coin locker.[%p]
Then I explain the situation to Moeka. My plan is to get ahead of the package.[%p]
After killing some time at Starbecks, we rent a car.[%p]
I don’t have a license, so Moeka’s driving.[%p]
We go to the street in front of the roundabout, facing Showa-dori, and park near Yodobashi Camera. Now we wait.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nervous?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You look terrified. How long have you been driving?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...First time.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? This is your first time!? Oh come on... just don’t crash.”[%p]
I was surprised Moeka had a license in the first place. Apparently FB told her it would come in handy for her Rounder work.[%p]
I have Moeka wait in the car while I keep a lookout on the roundabout.[%p]
The white station wagon’s already stopped there.[%p]
From this distance, I can clearly see Tennouji in the driver’s seat.[%p]
Nobody else is riding.[%p]
The crew cut guy should arrive just after 5 PM.[%p]
As expected, the crew cut man arrives right on time, effortlessly dragging the suitcase behind him.[%p]
It feels weird seeing the exact same scene from a different angle.[%p]
I hurry back to the car, where Moeka’s waiting.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“He’s coming!”[%p]
The station wagon rolls past us.[%p]
It takes a left turn at the Showa-dori intersection, towards Okachimachi.[%p]
Moeka smoothly sets the car in motion.[%p]
Finally, we arrive at Tennouji’s house in Okachimachi.[%p]
This is the house where Suzuha lived. Her rusty old mountain bike is still sitting out front.[%p]
Tennouji brings the IBN 5100 inside.[%p]
We stop a little farther down the road and keep watch.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“What does this mean?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Where is FB?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The question is why did he bring it inside. Is he just holding onto it? Or...”[%p]
Is he FB? Does he know FB?[%p]
Moeka insists that FB is a woman.[%p]
So maybe it’s Tennouji’s wife, whom I’ve never met.[%p]
I have Moeka show me one of FB’s mails.[%p]
She’s kept a lot of mails archived like this one.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“M4 is my codename...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“FB... gave it to me.”[%p]
Moeka’s a mailing machine. She sent FB nearly 10 mails a day, but FB replied to every single one.[%p]
You’d have to be a saint to reply to all those emails. No wonder Moeka was so dependent on FB.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So... time for another stakeout.”[%p]
I have Daru set up a wireless infrared camera on the telephone pole down the street.[%p]
We park a couple blocks away and watch the video feed.[%p]
The next day, Tennouji goes to work on his moped like usual. He returns after sunset.[%p]
There’s no sign of his daughter, Nae, or his wife.[%p]
Something finally happens early Sunday morning.[%p]
Just before 3 AM, six people show up at Tennouji’s house.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s them!”[%p]
It’s dark, but I recognize them.[%p]
They’re the Rounders who raided the lab with Moeka.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka doesn’t show much of a reaction.[%p]
I thought she knew them.[%p]
I ask, but she says she’s never met them before.[%p]
It looks like this worldline’s Moeka has been cut off completely.[%p]
Were they done with her once she found them an IBN 5100?[%p]
Tennouji comes outside and loads the IBN 5100 into the station wagon.[%p]
Then the six men get in and drive away.[%p]
Tennouji sees them off, then goes back inside his house. [%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“What now?”[%p]
I’m interested in Tennouji’s story, but the IBN 5100 will lead us to FB.[%p]
We decide to follow the station wagon.[%p]
The pursuit ends at Narita International Airport.[%p]
The six men, IBN 5100 in tow, board a plane headed for France.[%p]
France. SERN’s home country.[%p]
What does this mean?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Tennouji’s wife might be FB.”[%p]
Since there’s been no sign of FB this far, she must be an extremely cautious individual. But the evidence suggests only one possibility.[%p]
On worldline Alpha 1, Moeka’s men attacked the night the Time Leap Machine was completed. Their timing was perfect.[%p]
It makes sense if you assume that Tennouji is closely linked to FB. He was right downstairs the whole time we were discussing our plans. FB knew exactly what we were up to.[%p]
We were dancing to her tune all along.[%p]
When we get back to Akiba, Moeka and I start walking towards Tennouji’s house.[%p]
But on the way, I get an angry call from Kurisu demanding an update, so I decide to take care of that first.[%p]
