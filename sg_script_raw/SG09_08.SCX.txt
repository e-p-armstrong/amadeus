[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu sighs when she sees me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I thought I asked you to keep me posted.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve been busy.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Busy. Right.”[%p]
Kurisu glances at Moeka.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Were you worried about me?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“O-of course not! Why should I care what you’re up to?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s just... Mayuri was really worried. I don’t want to see her sad.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So at least give her a call, okay?”[%p]
Now that she mentions it, it feels like I haven’t talked to Mayuri in forever.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m doing this to save Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m close to discovering our true enemy.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Our enemy? But...”[%p]
Kurisu glances at Moeka again.[%p]
Moeka is completely expressionless. She’s lightly kicking the dirt in boredom.[%p]
She hasn’t used her phone once since we began the search for FB.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Isn’t she our enemy?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She is an enemy, but we’re cooperating in order to uncover the truth.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Isn’t she the one who... killed Mayuri?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yes.”[%p]
However, Moeka’s just a pawn, and one that no longer poses a threat.[%p]
To save Mayuri, I need to capture the king. Well, the king’s cellphone.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Whatever. So where are you going now? Take me with you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you gone mad, assistant mine?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m perfectly sane, and I’m not your assistant.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It could be dangerous.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh...”[%p]
Kurisu falters for a moment, but quickly tightens her expression.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Do I die today?”[%p]
I’ve experienced the future, so I know who dies today.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No. You don’t die.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then there’s no problem. This worldline has essentially guaranteed my survival.”[%p]
Right. Kurisu doesn’t die today. Neither does Mayuri.[%p]
The only person who dies today is...[%p]
Kiryu Moeka.[%p]
This afternoon, she kills herself.[%p]
I’ve already told Moeka her fate.[%p]
But in spite of that, Moeka doesn’t seem upset -- at least on the surface. She’s expressionless as always. The only difference is that she’s not checking her phone as often.[%p]
But Moeka’s not a strong woman.[%p]
Beneath that expressionless mask, is she struggling against the fear of death?[%p]
