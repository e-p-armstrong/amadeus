I decide to confront Tennouji directly.[%p]
I have Kurisu stand guard outside the house while Moeka and I go inside.[%p]
Not that we’re planning to break in. We ring the doorbell like honest citizens.[%p]
Tennouji soon opens the door and invites us into the living room.[%p]
The divergence meter is sitting in its usual spot. I glance at the numbers.[%p]
0.523307%.[%p]
There’s still a long way to go before I reach one percent. How much more of this can I take?[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Make yerselves at home.”[%p]
It’s just after dawn, much too early for guests, but Tennouji welcomes us with a smile.[%p]
He even starts preparing some instant coffee.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re an early riser, Mister Braun.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Yeah. Gotta see my little girl off to school.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“I know it’s summer break, but habits die hard.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is your daughter still asleep?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Hey. You thinking of trying something while she’s sleeping? Touch her and I’ll break your head, got it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry.”[%p]
I’m more interested in his wife. There’s still no sign of her.[%p]
Is she asleep too? Or could she be hiding somewhere?[%p]
I’d like to do a thorough search of the house, but of course that’s impossible.[%p]
And then there’s what he said just now about seeing Nae off to school.[%p]
That sounded like something a single father would say.[%p]
I suspected that FB was Tennouji’s wife, but that may have been a mistake.[%p]
Maybe Tennouji is just another courier after all. Maybe he doesn’t even know about FB.[%p]
There’s the possibility that FB might not even be in Akiba.[%p]
I need answers.[%p]
But how do I get them?[%p]
Moeka is just staring at the floor.[%p]
I can’t count on her for any bright ideas.[%p]
And whether or not Tennouji’s wife is FB, I don’t think this man will fall for any tricks.[%p]
I decide to go for the direct approach.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A few hours ago, six men stopped by this house to pick up a package, which they then delivered to France. You were there. I saw you.”[%p]
This time, Tennouji doesn’t give me his usual macho attitude. He just smiles softly.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“And?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The package contained an IBN 5100. You know what that is, of course.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Yeah, the legendary retro PC.”[%p]
This is too easy. He’s never this cooperative.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you just another courier? Or are you...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A Rounder?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“...”[%p]
Instead of answering my question, Tennouji looks straight at Moeka.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Did you betray us, M4?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...!?”[%p]
Moeka jerks upright.[%p]
M4 is Moeka’s codename, something only FB should know.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“No... are you... FB?”[%p]
Tennouji laughs once, a dry sound.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Ever heard of Ferdinand Braun?”[%p]
Moeka and I look at each other, confused by the sudden change of topic.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“C’mon, he was the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who invented the Braun Tube.”[%p]
Tennouji has a thing for Braun Tubes. I know that.[%p]
But what does that have to do with anything?[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Ferdinand Braun. Initials?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Ah!”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“FB...!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Now you get it.”[%p]
Tennouji casually produces a handgun. The motion is so smooth and natural that I don’t even recognize it as a gun at first.[%p]
Its heavy form gives off a chilling black luster.[%p]
The muzzle is pointed at Moeka.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...”[%p]
Moeka and I are unarmed. We didn’t plan for this![%p]
How could we have? We thought FB was Tennouji’s wife, not the man himself.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let me ask you one thing.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your wife...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“She died having Nae. Why?”[%p]
I curse silently.[%p]
No wonder I’ve never seen her. She’s been dead for years.[%p]
Tennouji... is FB.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“No... that can’t be...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“I thought I was your world, M4. Now you’re running away?”[%p]
Keeping his gun trained on Moeka, the man I knew as Mister Braun laughs scornfully.[%p]
We’re at an overwhelming disadvantage. I was a fool to believe the direct approach would work.[%p]
Now my recklessness is going to get both of us killed.[%p]
...No, not both of us. I don’t die here.[%p]
I’m here because I time leap on the 16th. That fact is written on the fabric of this worldline. [%p]
So if the attractor field model is right, I can’t possibly die now, on the morning of the 15th. [%p]
My survival is guaranteed by the same force that keeps killing Mayuri.[%p]
However...[%p]
Moeka has no such protection.[%p]
She dies today. It doesn’t matter how.[%p]
She could easily die now, right before my eyes.[%p]
What am I going to do about it?[%p]
Nothing.[%p]
It doesn’t matter.[%p]
My goal is to obtain FB’s cellphone and send a D-Mail to Moeka in the past.[%p]
[color index="A0140000"]That[color index="800000"] is the reason I’m here.[%p]
In any case, I mustn’t let his handgun scare me.[%p]
There’s no turning back now. All I can do is stay on the offensive.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So you’re a Rounder. SERN’s dog!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Their dog? Yeah... you ain’t wrong.”[%p]
Tennouji is like a different person today.[%p]
He’s composed. He doesn’t get angry, even when I provoke him.[%p]
You wouldn’t expect a man with a gun to be so calm.[%p]
Is this who he really is? Was the gruff but good-natured storekeeper just an act?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you shoot, it’ll wake up your daughter.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“So what?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you want your daughter to see you commit murder?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“My little girl’s smart as a button. She’ll understand.”[%p]
I grind my teeth.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t believe you’re a Rounder! You, of all people!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hashida Suzu didn’t give you a home so you could turn it into a safehouse for SERN!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“...”[%p]
Tennouji’s smile stiffens for a second.[%p]
But then he slaps his knee and laughs.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“You knew Suzu-san? You should’ve said something!”[%p]
Tennouji and I haven’t spoken about Suzuha on this worldline.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Anyway, what gives you the right to speak for her, huh? She died ten years ago. You were what, eight?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“How do you know how she’d feel?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...She told me.”[%p]
I glare at Tennouji. The anger and frustration are overwhelming.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She was here, in this time, not five days ago!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ll bring it to you here in Akihabara. That’s my duty, and I’ll see it through. The rest is up to you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Change the future. Please.”[%p]
I still remember her words vividly.[%p]
Though it feels like it’s been forever since she spoke them, in objective time, it was just a few days ago.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She was right there, and you never knew it!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hashida Suzu... no, Amane Suzuha was a time traveler! She came from the future to stop SERN!”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Wha...t?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You never noticed, FB? The woman who saved your life came from the year 2036. She was one of us, a lab member, the daughter of Hashida Itaru.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha hated SERN! And here you are, a man who owes her everything, doing their dirty work!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is this how you honor Suzuha’s memory!?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Stop making shit up!”[%p]
Tennouji thrusts his gun at me.[%p]
I barely manage to keep from flinching.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How did you turn out this way?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Fuck you! It’s complicated.”[%p]
Complicated...[%p]
Is that supposed to be an excuse?[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Are you... really FB?”[%p]
Moeka looks completely lost.[%p]
Tennouji sighs and lowers his gun.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Yeah, I am.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“The mails...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“I wrote them. Why did I pretend to be a woman? Camouflage, obviously. Had to hide my identity.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“The internet’s full of guys pretending to be girls.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“I gotta say though, M4, you send too much goddamn mail.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Who has time for that shit? You better be grateful I bothered to reply.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“No...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“FB was like... a mother to me...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’d do anything for FB...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“That was the point. It’s easy to manipulate nutjobs like you. Just gotta give ’em something to cling to.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Enough!”[%p]
I approach Tennouji, but freeze once he points the gun at me again.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Why did you... stop emailing me?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Huh? Oh, right. Your usefulness ended the second you dropped off that IBN 5100.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’m... useless?”[%p]
That was obvious.[%p]
I’ve been telling her this whole time that FB abandoned her.[%p]
I guess it wasn’t real to her until she heard it from FB’s own mouth.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Recruiting members directly is bad for secrecy, but the Rounders make up for it by choosing expendable assets with nowhere else to go.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Any member who finds an IBN 5100 is eliminated. No exceptions.”[%p]
...What? What is he saying?[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“That way, SERN gets to keep their secrets, plus have a cheap army of outcasts like us.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“FB...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“We’re all expendable, every last one of us. And it sucks, let me tell you.”[%p]
Without dropping his smile, Tennouji takes his gun...[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“As soon as our job’s done, they get rid of us. Guess that makes us cattle, not dogs.”[%p]
And presses it against the side of his head.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Eh?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Disobey orders, and they go after your family. I can’t let them touch my little girl, can I?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait! Don’t--”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Sorry for everything, Suzu-san.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Really, how did I turn out this way?”[%p]
He pulls the trigger.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Ah...ah...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wh...y...”[%p]
Brains splatter against the wall.[%p]
Tennouji’s massive body drops to the floor and sprawls out, motionless.[%p]
A dark red stain begins to spread over the tatami mats.[%p]
He’s dead.[%p]
Tennouji is dead.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“No... why...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
It’s over, and I still don’t understand what happened.[%p]
Would he have killed himself even if we hadn’t confronted him? Was his death, too, the will of fate?[%p]
Tennouji had completed his mission. Maybe he chose to eliminate himself rather than face SERN assassins.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You fool...”[%p]
I bite down hard on my lip.[%p]
I pound my fists against the floor.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You left your daughter all alone!”[%p]
He meant to protect her with his sacrifice, but what is Nae supposed to do now? [%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How could you die with a smile!?”[%p]
All Rounders are expendable, he said.[%p]
Does that mean FB was just another pawn?[%p]
Is that how SERN operates?[%p]
That’s insanity![%p]
This can’t be real.[%p]
Nae. Is she still asleep in the next room, blissfully unaware of her father’s suicide?[%p]
How do I explain this to her...[%p]
Should I run?[%p]
Again, strictly speaking, my purpose is to obtain FB’s phone.[%p]
Once I send the D-Mail and change the worldline, all of this will be undone.[%p]
I can run like a coward, and no one will know.[%p]
...I’ll know.[%p]
I timidly slide open the door to Nae’s bedroom.[%p]
It looks like you’d expect. There’s a red backpack hanging next to the desk, and there’s a futon laid out on the floor.[%p]
But Nae isn’t there.[%p]
The window is open. The lace curtains are waving, as if to invite the fresh morning breeze inside.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...She’s gone?”[%p]
Where did she go?[%p]
No... don’t tell me SERN kidnapped her?[%p]
I don’t even know if she was here when we arrived.[%p]
None of this makes sense. This isn’t the world I know.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...His phone.”[%p]
I need Tennouji’s phone.[%p]
I’m relieved Nae isn’t here.[%p]
I don’t have to tell her about her father’s death.[%p]
I find Tennouji’s phone in his pants pocket.[%p]
I was ready to kill him for it if I had to. I never thought he would kill himself.[%p]
And now I’m looting his dead body like a hyena scavenging for scraps of meat. I make myself want to puke.[%p]
I leave as soon as I have the phone, dragging the catatonic Moeka with me.[%p]
We regroup with Kurisu, who was worried sick waiting outside, and hail a taxi.[%p]
I wish we hadn’t spent so much time parked near Tennouji’s house. Once the body is found, the police might trace the rental car back to us.[%p]
Maybe we should have reported it first, but I’d rather not have to answer any questions.[%p]
Besides... soon, none of this will have happened.[%p]
