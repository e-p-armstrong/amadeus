[name]Kurisu[line]“...So the manager was FB.”[%p]
First, we take Moeka back to her apartment. There, I explain to Kurisu what happened.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka didn’t say a word on the way back. Now she’s sitting on the floor by the entrance, staring off into space.[%p]
It must have been quite a shock to hear Tennouji’s -- FB’s -- confession.[%p]
The one person she trusted betrayed her. She may never recover.[%p]
But were Tennouji’s actions really a betrayal?[%p]
I’m not quite convinced. Something felt off back there.[%p]
Rounders who complete their mission are eliminated. No exceptions.[%p]
That’s what FB said.[%p]
But in that case, why wasn’t Moeka killed?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Moeka...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s possible... that FB did what he did so you could live.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe he didn’t abandon you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Maybe, by pushing you away, he was trying to keep you safe.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
This may just be wishful thinking.[%p]
We’ll never know FB’s true intentions.[%p]
But I want to believe that Tennouji did care for her, that there was a place for Moeka somewhere.[%p]
...What am I doing?[%p]
Why am I trying to comfort Moeka?[%p]
Maybe I’m just soft.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe! We need to send the D-Mail now.”[%p]
Kurisu’s expression is grave.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Miss this chance, and you could be in a lot of trouble.”[%p]
Kurisu had the same thought as me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Your goal is to save Mayuri, not take revenge on SERN. Right?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I don’t want anyone else to be hurt because of the machine we built.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yeah. You’re right.”[%p]
FB’s phone is in my possession. There’s no longer any reason to stay on this worldline.[%p]
It’s only a matter of time until the police come looking for us. I should send the D-Mail immediately.[%p]
When I do, the present will be reconstructed.[%p]
Tennouji will still be alive. Moeka will still be in contact with FB.[%p]
And at last, the IBN 5100 will return to me.[%p]
I just need to think about saving Mayuri, and all will be well.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you think Daru’s still in the lab?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ll try calling.”[%p]
I’ll send the same message I tried to send earlier from Moeka’s phone.[%p]
Only this time, it will be from FB’s phone.[%p]
When Moeka sees it, she’ll believe it to be an order from FB. Knowing her dependence on FB, she’ll obey without question.[%p]
It makes me sick to be taking advantage of Moeka’s vulnerabilities like this.[%p]
How am I any different from FB?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“He said he’ll be there in five minutes.”[%p]
So we just wait until then.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“By the way, something weird happened back there.”[%p]
After closing her phone, Kurisu glances at Moeka and lowers her voice.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“While I was waiting outside, I heard a gunshot.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And right after that... I saw her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Her... who?”[%p]
I ask, even though I already know the answer.[%p]
There’s only one person it could be.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Nae-chan.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“She ran out the back door.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“When I called her to stop... our eyes met.”[%p]
Kurisu bites her lip, as if fighting an unpleasant memory.[%p]
It happened right after she heard the gunshot.[%p]
If that’s true, then Nae saw her father die.[%p]
She saw her father die... and ran away.[%p]
[name]Rintaro & Kurisu[line][center]”Wha!?”[%p]
There’s a knock on the door.[%p]
Someone’s here.[%p]
Who?[%p]
Moeka, who had been squatting by the entrance, slowly lifts her head.[%p]
This is wrong.[%p]
The timing’s too perfect.[%p]
Today, Kiryu Moeka dies. This worldline has already approved that fate.[%p]
Has it come for her already?[%p]
Moeka reaches for the doorknob.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait! Don’t--”[%p]
I try to stop her.[%p]
But too late. Moeka is already turning the doorknob.[%p]
The door opens slowly.[%p]
And there stands...[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Hi!”[%p]
An innocent greeting.[%p]
A child’s voice. Familiar.[%p]
How did she find this place?[%p]
How did she get here?[%p]
[color index="A0140000"]Why[color index="800000"] did she come here?[%p]
“She ran away.”[%p]
“Our eyes met.”[%p]
“Right after I heard the gunshot.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Guh...”[%p]
Nae steps up to Moeka. Moeka’s body blocks my view.[%p]
The next instant, Moeka drops to her knees like a string-cut puppet.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Aha!”[%p]
An innocent laugh.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Ahaha!”[%p]
Hands dyed with blood.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Ahahaha!”[%p]
A cleaver in her hand.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No way...”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Yes way.”[%p]
Nae’s lips twist into a victorious sneer.[%p]
She looks straight at me, her eyes burning with intense hatred.[%p]
Those aren’t the eyes of a child.[%p]
What’s going on here?[%p]
Is this really Nae?[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I won’t forgive you.”[%p]
The venom in her voice chills me to the bone.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Daddy died because of you.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I’ll never forgive you.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I’ll kill you with my own two hands.”[%p]
Kurisu and I stare in shocked silence. Neither of us can move a muscle.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
My heart skips a beat. I feel like someone just walked over my grave.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I’ll come for you in fifteen years. I hope you spend them quivering in terror.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Aha! Ahaha!”[%p]
Nae tosses the knife away and leaves, laughing all the while.[%p]
I hear the sound of her footsteps pattering down the stairs.[%p]
Soon they fade away, leaving us in silence.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wh-what the hell was that? A demon? Was she possessed?”[%p]
My entire body is shaking. I have to struggle just to move a finger.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“W-what about Moeka!?”[%p]
Moeka’s clothes are soaked in blood. There’s a gaping wound in her abdomen where Nae stabbed her.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Calm down!”[%p]
Kurisu yells for me to come to my senses, and then she takes out her phone.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Check on Kiryu-san! I’ll call an ambulance.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No, wait! Before that...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Maybe you should just send the D-Mail.”[%p]
Even now, Kurisu is calm.[%p]
I feel an irrational surge of anger at her composure, but I know that she’s right.[%p]
Once I send the D-Mail, this worldline will be undone.[%p]
I know that, but still I run to Moeka’s side.[%p]
When I lift her up in my arms, I see that her chest is already covered in blood.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Moeka!”[%p]
She’s my enemy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hang in there!”[%p]
She killed Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you hear me!? Moeka!”[%p]
I can’t understand her.[%p]
I can’t forgive her.[%p]
And yet, I can’t help but call her name.[%p]
Because in a sense, she’s a victim too.[%p]
Moeka slowly opens her eyes.[%p]
Her eyes are blank and unfocused. She’s fading fast.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...I... k...ed...”[%p]
She tries to speak, but her voice catches in her throat.[%p]
I bring my ear closer to her lips.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I... killed...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...someone...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...precious... to you...”[%p]
Yes, you did. Countless times.[%p]
Not on this worldline, but on others.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“This... is my punishment...”[%p]
The will of fate.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’m... sorry...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’m so...rry...”[%p]
I silently squeeze Moeka’s hand.[%p]
Moeka doesn’t squeeze back. She no longer has the strength.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I had... nothing... except FB...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“The only... place... I belonged...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I would... kill... to protect it...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“You’re right... to hate me...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“I’m... so...rry...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I forgive you.”[%p]
The words come to my lips unbidden.[%p]
But as soon as I speak them, I understand why.[%p]
Moeka does not kill Mayuri on this worldline.[%p]
Even if she could, it would not happen until tomorrow.[%p]
This Moeka, the one dying in my arms, is innocent.[%p]
And yet, even now, she says, “I’m sorry.”[%p]
How can I not answer her?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I forgive you.”[%p]
Perhaps the words are meaningless.[%p]
Forgiving Moeka will not cure Nae’s hate. Neither will Moeka’s death.[%p]
I don’t even know if I truly mean what I’m saying.[%p]
But still, I remember what Kurisu said.[%p]
My goal is to save Mayuri, not avenge her.[%p]
So here, now...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I forgive you.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
The anguish seems to fade from Moeka’s face.[%p]
Her eyes slowly close.[%p]
A tear slides down Moeka’s cheek.[%p]
Her hand slips from my grasp.[%p]
She is no longer breathing.[%p]
Biting my lip, I lay Moeka to rest on the floor.[%p]
I place her purple phone in her hands.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Okabe.”[%p]
Kurisu calls to me in a weak voice.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I think you should send the D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Everything’s ready at the lab.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
Moeka and FB are gone, but Mayuri’s fate remains unchanged.[%p]
The universe still demands her death.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Christina.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When I send the D-Mail and change divergence, do you think Moeka’s fate will change?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Based on the attractor field model you spoke of...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“She’ll be more likely to live if divergence exceeds 1%.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Sorry. I wish I knew what to say.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry about it.”[%p]
I stand up.[%p]
Moeka’s blood clings to my hands.[%p]
It won’t come off, even when I wipe it with a tissue.[%p]
I stop trying and take out FB’s phone.[%p]
I nod to Kurisu.[%p]
She calls Daru and tells him to activate the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
I take one last look at Moeka’s body lying there.[%p]
Causality is a strange and terrifying thing.[%p]
At the beginning of all this, Moeka killed Mayuri.[%p]
But now Moeka lies dead, while Mayuri still lives.[%p]
All because I changed the past.[%p]
Moeka. If you’re going to apologize for a sin you didn’t commit, then I must apologize as well.[%p]
I am responsible for twisting your fate.[%p]
...And for twisting the fate of Tennouji Nae.[%p]
I ruined that innocent girl’s life, made her something other than what she was meant to be.[%p]
Is it okay to just leave her like this?[%p]
Of course, if I send the D-Mail now, this worldline will be undone.[%p]
Nae’s twisted fate will be corrected.[%p]
There’s no point in worrying about it.[%p]
I should just think about Mayuri.[%p]
I shouldn’t burden myself with any more problems.[%p]
...Is this really okay?[%p]
Of course it is.[%p]
Send the D-Mail.[%p]
That’s all I need to do.[%p]
Why won’t my fingers move?[%p]
I already know what I need to do![%p]
And yet...![%p]
The world warps.[%p]
Once the distortion dissipates, Kurisu is gone. So is Moeka’s body.[%p]
The phone I’m gripping is my own. FB’s phone has disappeared.[%p]
I look at my hands. They’re clean. No blood.[%p]
No knife on the floor either.[%p]
Everything was undone.[%p]
But... then why am I in this room?[%p]
There are two bottles of Dr P on the coffee table.[%p]
Both are open.[%p]
One is nearly empty, but the other is still full.[%p]
I jump at the sound of a running shower.[%p]
After a few minutes, Moeka comes out of the bathroom, expressionless.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...You’re alive.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...?”[%p]
Moeka sits down on the tatami mats, not questioning why I’m here.[%p]
She takes out her purple phone and begins typing a mail.[%p]
It feels like forever since I’ve seen her lightning-speed typing.[%p]
This mail doesn’t make sense.[%p]
It reads like Moeka and I were discussing the IBN 5100 just moments ago.[%p]
...Of course. That’s exactly what happened on this worldline.[%p]
That explains why I’m here.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your supervisor? You mean FB?”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
So FB’s still alive.[%p]
I feel relief, but also fear. I mustn’t forget that he is my enemy.[%p]
For now, however, I’m more interested in what Moeka just said.[%p]
FB canceled her mission to retrieve the IBN 5100?[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Doing your duty sets you up for disposal. So we’re more like cattle than dogs.”[%p]
I recall his last words.[%p]
Perhaps he canceled her mission so that they wouldn’t be eliminated.[%p]
But I don’t think that will prevent their deaths.[%p]
They cannot escape their fate.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I won’t forgive you, until I kill you with my own hands.”[%p]
I cover my ears.[%p]
I can’t get that childish, yet hate-filled voice out of my head.[%p]
On that worldline, I turned an innocent girl into a murderer.[%p]
I bite my lip hard, hard enough to draw blood.[%p]
That worldline has already been undone.[%p]
But how will things turn out on this new worldline?[%p]
No, there’s no point thinking about it.[%p]
If the plan worked, the IBN 5100 should already be back in my possession.[%p]
And if that’s the case...[%p]
Then there’s no need to stay on this worldline, either.[%p]
