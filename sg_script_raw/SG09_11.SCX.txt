[name]Kurisu[line]“...Okabe?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wasn’t there something strange about that girl?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That girl... you mean Nae-chan?”[%p]
I nod.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...She was like a different person.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What did she mean, she’ll kill me in fifteen years?”[%p]
It bothers me.[%p]
Does she know something?[%p]
What was she implying?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t worry about it, Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Send the D-Mail right now. That’ll solve everything.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I put FB’s phone in my pocket.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t pretend I didn’t see that.”[%p]
Nae’s crime is partly my responsibility.[%p]
And I need to know what she meant when she promised to kill me fifteen years from now.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m time leaping. Back to the lab.”[%p]
Kurisu sighs, but I pretend not to hear it.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Our enemy? But...”[%p]
Kurisu glances at Moeka, then whispers into my ear.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Isn’t she our enemy?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...It’s about 7 AM, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well, yeah, but where did that question come from?”[%p]
After time leaping four hours back, I find myself in front of the station.[%p]
This is right after Moeka and I met up with Kurisu after returning from Narita Airport.[%p]
After this comes the Tennouji residence.[%p]
Moeka is standing a few meters away, kicking the dirt in boredom.[%p]
Moeka was dead just a few minutes ago, but now she’s perfectly fine.[%p]
I feel no surprise. I suppose I’ve grown accustomed to this particular facet of time travel.[%p]
After all, I’ve seen Mayuri come back to life countless times already.[%p]
There is one other thing experience has taught me.[%p]
Today, Moeka and Tennouji will die, and there’s nothing we can do to stop it.[%p]
I know it’s cruel, but I didn’t come back here to save them.[%p]
I don’t have the means to, and it isn’t my problem.[%p]
The problem is Nae.[%p]
We arrive in front of Tennouji’s house, just like we did before I time leaped.[%p]
But this time, I wait outside with Kurisu.[%p]
Moeka enters alone, expressionless as ever.[%p]
While we wait outside, I tell Kurisu what’s about to happen.[%p]
I also tell her to wait a little while after she hears the gunshot, and then go inside and take Tennouji’s phone.[%p]
It feels like an eternity passes in silence.[%p]
And then...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...!”[%p]
Kurisu gasps. Her body goes stiff.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There really was a gunshot...”[%p]
I immediately look around.[%p]
Just as Kurisu told me, I see a girl come out of the window.[%p]
She walks away quickly, but at the same time taking care not to make a sound.[%p]
That’s not how a child acts after witnessing her father’s death.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait!”[%p]
Nae looks over her shoulder.[%p]
She spears me with eyes full of hatred.[%p]
That alone is enough to make me shiver.[%p]
It’s pitiful, but a tiny little girl is making me nervous.[%p]
Something is very wrong here.[%p]
This Nae is like a completely different person.[%p]
I want to know her true identity.[%p]
That’s why I time leaped instead of sending the D-Mail.[%p]
Nae is still running, ignoring my calls to stop.[%p]
I run after her.[%p]
Out of shape though I may be, I’m still more than a match for a 12-year-old girl.[%p]
The distance between us quickly shortens.[%p]
Nae keeps running, occasionally looking back at me and grinding her teeth in a very un-childlike manner.[%p]
Normally, a child being chased by a man will cry and scream things like “Stay away!” or “Help!” [%p]
But this girl says nothing. The only sound is her heavy breathing.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stop!”[%p]
I call out to her once more when she’s nearly in arm’s reach.[%p]
Unexpectedly, Nae slows down, and eventually stops to catch her breath.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“...haah... ...ha ...ah...”[%p]
Looks like she’s realized she can’t get away.[%p]
From the sound of her breathing, she must be at her limit.[%p]
We’re alone. Kurisu and Moeka must still be at the house, and the streets are empty thanks to the Obon holidays.[%p]
Perfect. I was afraid someone might report me as a child molester. Now I can get what I need to know out of this strange girl who looks like Nae.[%p]
I call out to her as I catch my breath.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you really Tennouji Nae?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“...”[%p]
Nae glares at me as she catches her breath.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You plan to kill Kiryu Moeka after this, don’t you?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“That’s right.”[%p]
She punctuates her nonchalant reply with a cruel smile.[%p]
That is not the face of a child.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Revenge for your father?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“You and Kiryu Moeka killed Daddy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your dad killed himself. He blew his own brains out.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“He would have done it even if we hadn’t been here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not our fault.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I don’t care.”[%p]
What?[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Kiryu Moeka was there when Daddy died, but she didn’t stop him.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I won’t forgive her.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Nor you, Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“You weren’t there, but Daddy wouldn’t have died if you hadn’t gotten involved.”[%p]
Wait, is she blaming me for finding the IBN 5100?[%p]
How the hell was I supposed to know?[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“But I won’t kill you now. I can’t.”[%p]
The tiny little girl, barely half my height, looks up at me with a smile that chills my blood.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I’ll kill you in fifteen years. Keep living in fear until then.”[%p]
I get on my knees and grab Nae by the shoulders.[%p]
I hold back my terror and meet her stare for stare.[%p]
And yet, this girl doesn’t even flinch.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who... are you?”[%p]
She isn’t Tennouji Nae.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean, you’ll kill me in fifteen years?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Exactly what it sounds like.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Fifteen years from now, I [color index="A0140000"]killed[color index="800000"] you.”[%p]
Killed? Why is she using past tense?[%p]
Nae laughs once, a harsh and mocking sound.[%p]
Then she leans in and whispers.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“You still don’t get it?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Just now, you asked who I am.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I am Tennouji Nae. No doubt about that.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“But I [color index="A0140000"]remember[color index="800000"] the next fifteen years.”[%p]
No...[%p]
Did she...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Time leap!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“!!”[%p]
Nae suddenly whips out a knife, catching me completely off guard.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gh, aah...!”[%p]
Nae drives the knife into the elbow of my right arm, which was grabbing her shoulder.[%p]
Blood sprays onto Nae’s face, but she doesn’t even blink.[%p]
Instead...[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Ahahahaha!”[%p]
She laughs.[%p]
Just like she laughed when she killed Moeka.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn... it...”[%p]
The intense pain brings me to my knees.[%p]
For a moment, I panic. But somehow, I manage to convince myself that I’m fine.[%p]
I won’t die here, I tell myself. This worldline won’t accept that.[%p]
It’s just like Nae said herself.[%p]
It’s not that she [color index="A0140000"]won’t[color index="800000"] kill me. She [color index="A0140000"]can’t[color index="800000"].[%p]
If she tried, something would surely interfere.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Wanna hear how I killed you?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“In the future, you were one of the founders of the resistance against SERN.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“But I captured you, and imprisoned you, and tortured you every which way I could think of!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]”You cried, and screamed, and begged for your life, all while covered in piss and shit!” [%p]
[name]Nae[line]“You were one sorry sight, Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“After I ran out of things to do, I finally slit your throat. And then I stabbed you! Over and over and over again, so many times I don’t even remember.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“That’s how your life is going to end. That’s your punishment for murdering Daddy!”[%p]
Nae grabs my arm and digs her tiny fingers into the wound.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ugahhh!”[%p]
My nerves burst into flame. Not just in my arm, but throughout my entire body.[%p]
The pain forces the air out of my lungs in a bloodcurdling scream.[%p]
I can’t shake off Nae’s hands.[%p]
I can’t even move a finger against the pain.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Aha!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“SERN confiscated your Time Leap Machine. They kept it locked away for fifteen years. Until I came for it.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“After I became a Rounder and killed you, I used that machine to come all the way back here.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“It was hard, let me tell you. That piece of shit can’t leap more than 48 hours at a time.”[%p]
To travel fifteen years in forty-eight-hour increments would take...[%p]
Damn. I can’t calculate through the pain.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“2738 leaps.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I messed up a few times, though, so it was really more like twice that. At least. I kinda lost count after a while!”[%p]
Now I get it.[%p]
When I came to this worldline, I went back to the lab after learning of Moeka’s suicide.[%p]
And once I got there, I found evidence someone had used the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
So that was Nae’s final time leap![%p]
Nae keeps staring into my eyes as her fingers crawl deeper into my wound.[%p]
I bite my lip in a desperate attempt to bear the pain.[%p]
My blood won’t stop flowing.[%p]
It collects into a puddle and stains the asphalt dark red.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Revenge was all I lived for. I won’t let anyone get in my way. I will kill Kiryu Moeka with my own two hands.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I won’t let that bitch kill herself. She doesn’t deserve to go out easy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You leapt fifteen years just for [color index="A0140000"]that[color index="800000"]?”[%p]
She’s insane.[%p]
And it was Moeka and I who made her that way, who turned an innocent little girl into a creature of hatred starved for vengeance.[%p]
We stole fifteen years of her life.[%p]
Fifteen years. I can’t understand what it’s like to live with such hatred for so long.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Just for that?”[%p]
Nae’s slender fingers pry deeper into my wound. So deep, I can feel her fingers against my bone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gah, gwaaah...!”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“It might not mean much to you, but to me, killing you two means everything!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So you kill Moeka... but what comes next?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Next?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you gonna repeat those fifteen years all over again?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Hmph. What do I care about those fifteen years?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“There’s nothing for me there...”[%p]
She does not cry. She does not sneer. Her voice is flat and emotionless as she speaks these words.[%p]
There’s nothing more I can to say to this girl I destroyed.[%p]
At last, Nae lets go of my arm. She looks in disgust at her hands, now covered in my blood.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I don’t need anything from you now.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Just wait in fear and regret, Okabe Rintaro. Until I come for you in fifteen years.”[%p]
I’m powerless to stop her from running away.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hahaha...”[%p]
Dry laughter leaks out of my mouth.[%p]
That girl’s disconnected from causality, just like I am.[%p]
I asked her what she would do after killing Moeka. She didn’t answer. [%p]
The first time she lived those fifteen years, all she had was revenge.[%p]
And after time leaping thousands of times, she exacted that revenge.[%p]
How will she live those fifteen years the second time around?[%p]
Will she kill me again?[%p]
Will her revenge be complete then?[%p]
Or will it continue forever, until even she forgets why?[%p]
The thought squeezes my heart like a vise.[%p]
Does time travel bring nothing but pain?[%p]
We built a time machine out of curiosity.[%p]
We were fools.[%p]
If not for our meddling, SERN would not have targeted us.[%p]
Mayuri would not have died.[%p]
Suzuha would not have had to travel to the past.[%p]
Faris would not have lost her father twice.[%p]
Lukako would not have had to forsake her feelings for me.[%p]
And Moeka would not have killed Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe!”[%p]
Kurisu runs up to me.[%p]
She turns pale at the sight of my bleeding arm.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What happened!? Are you okay!?”[%p]
She kneels in front of me. Worry is etched on her face.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The phone...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I brought it, but...”[%p]
Kurisu hands me FB’s phone.[%p]
I take it and start typing out the mail with my left hand.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, tell me what happened, will you!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Should I call an ambulance!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Calm down...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m gonna send the D-Mail now.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“R-right. If the worldline changes, then this wound will go away.”[%p]
Yes, but who cares about my wound?[%p]
Tennouji’s death, Moeka’s death, and the damage to Nae’s soul will all be undone.[%p]
That’s what matters.[%p]
I finish the mail and take a breath.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey... why do you think Tennouji didn’t kill Moeka?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
Any Rounder who finds an IBN 5100 is silenced. No exceptions.[%p]
That’s what Tennouji said.[%p]
In that case, the one who should have been eliminated first was Moeka. She found the IBN 5100 in the first place.[%p]
And yet, Tennouji cut contact with her instead.[%p]
And when we exposed his true identity, he shot himself, not Moeka.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I think... I think he wanted to save Moeka.”[%p]
Perhaps that’s just wishful thinking.[%p]
Perhaps I’m just looking for an ounce of comfort in all this suffering.[%p]
Even if that was Tennouji’s intention, it was meaningless. Moeka will die today. Whether by her own hand or Nae’s, it doesn’t matter.[%p]
However...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I hope it works out on the Beta worldline.”[%p]
They are the enemy.[%p]
I should hate them for killing Mayuri.[%p]
But in some sense, Tennouji, Moeka, and Nae are all just victims of my foolish experiments.[%p]
I pray that they can live normal lives, at least on the Beta worldline.[%p]
For their sake as well as Mayuri’s, I must send this D-Mail.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry, Nae...”[%p]
Once this D-Mail is sent, this worldline will be undone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I can’t let you have your revenge.”[%p]
The world shatters, warps, and reforms.[%p]
Eventually, those sensations disappear, and color gradually returns to the world. I find myself standing in the street near the lab.[%p]
The burning pain in my right arm is suddenly gone.[%p]
I look down. There’s no wound, no blood.[%p]
Instead, I’m holding a convenience store bag with two bottles of Dr P.[%p]
I guess it worked.[%p]
I head straight for Moeka’s apartment.[%p]
When I get there, Moeka opens the door normally and peeks out at me.[%p]
She looks fine. No signs of despair. No bloodstain by the door. No knife either.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Okabe-kun...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“How did you know where I...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let me kill some time here!”[%p]
I barge into the room.[%p]
The hour of Moeka’s death passes with no sign of Nae.[%p]
The worldline has changed.[%p]
Moeka’s right in front of me, but she sends me mail.[%p]
It feels like forever since we last conversed like this.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“FB told you to stop...”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
So FB’s still alive.[%p]
I feel relief, but also fear. I mustn’t forget that he is my enemy.[%p]
For now, however, I’m more interested in what Moeka just said.[%p]
FB canceled her mission to retrieve the IBN 5100?[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Doing your duty sets you up for disposal. So we’re more like cattle than dogs.”[%p]
I recall his last words.[%p]
Perhaps he canceled her mission so that they wouldn’t be eliminated.[%p]
If that’s the truth, then maybe he really was trying to save Moeka.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Live in fear and regret, Okabe Rintaro. Until we meet again in fifteen years.”[%p]
I wonder what happened to Nae.[%p]
I can’t get that childish, yet hate-filled voice out of my head.[%p]
On that worldline, I turned an innocent girl into a murderer.[%p]
I bite my lip hard, hard enough to draw blood.[%p]
I won’t fear you, Nae. Nor will I repent.[%p]
That worldline has already been undone.[%p]
But... how will things turn out on this new worldline?[%p]
No, there’s no point thinking about it.[%p]
If the plan worked, the IBN 5100 should already be back in my possession.[%p]
And if that’s the case...[%p]
Then there’s no need to stay on this worldline, either.[%p]
