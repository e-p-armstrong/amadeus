On the way back to the lab, I stop by the Braun Tube Workshop and peek in through the window.[%p]
The 42-inch CRT is powered on, and Tennouji -- FB -- is lounging in front of it, reading the sports pages.[%p]
FB is still alive. His daughter, Nae, has no reason to hate anyone now.[%p]
I climb the stairs to the lab.[%p]
There’s nobody there but Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you been to Kiryu Moeka’s apartment?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Huh?”[%p]
Kurisu pauses her @channel browsing session to look at me in confusion.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Moeka-san’s apartment? Never.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, okay.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why do you ask?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It doesn’t matter. Just wondering.”[%p]
I cut across the lounge and head straight for the development room.[%p]
In the middle of that room sits the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
After a glance at the Time Leap Machine, I scan the shelves.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s here!”[%p]
A large, familiar cardboard box.[%p]
I was right.[%p]
Inside the box is the IBN 5100, the legendary retro PC stolen from me by a twist of fate.[%p]
At last, it has returned![%p]
The long battle is finally over.[%p]
I did it.[%p]
We can save Mayuri![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru! Daru! Where’s my super hacka!?”[%p]
I can’t contain my excitement.[%p]
My heart is beating like a jackhammer.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Uh, he’s not here.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“He went to ComiMa, remember?”[%p]
Oh... right.[%p]
In that case, he won’t return until evening.[%p]
I can’t wait that long.[%p]
So I fire up the time machine and leap.[%p]
As shape and color return to the world, I see Daru in front of his computer, sleepily playing an eroge.[%p]
Kurisu’s napping on the sofa. She probably just got done with her all-nighter on the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
Mayuri’s not around. She probably went to Lukako’s to beg him to cosplay.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru! Christina!”[%p]
Kurisu jerks awake.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s time for the final phase of Operation Verthandi!”[%p]
My sonorous declaration earns only blank stares.[%p]
Why are they so slow?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The IBN 5100, Daru!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...Yeah?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Listen to me, man! We have an IBN 5100!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Of course we do. You’re the one who found it, Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes! Yes I did! I found it at Yanabayashi Shrine!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...Have you been drinking too much soda?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Let me sleep, for crying out loud.”[%p]
Kurisu rubs her eyes and complains. She looks dead tired.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I was up all night.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A question, Daru. Have you researched how to use the IBN 5100?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? Well, yeah, I guess.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Can you believe I did it while preparing for ComiMa? I’m like a saint or something. They’d knight me for this in England.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then we shall call you Sir Super Hacka!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hell no.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Will you guys shut up? You’re giving me a headache.”[%p]
If Daru knows how to use the IBN 5100, then we can hack SERN right now![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hear me, lab mems!”[%p]
Mayuri’s not here, but that’s actually more convenient.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Our long struggle has at last reached its climax! Ragnarok is at hand!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now we must deliver the decisive blow. With the power of the IBN 5100, we shall crack SERN’s most secure database and destroy it from the inside!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Through the cowardly apparatus known as Echelon, the enemy has acquired precious intelligence on our activities. Now they plot to steal our sacred time machine, upon which rest the hopes and dreams of all mankind!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Beneath its scholarly trappings, SERN is a hive of scum and villainy, of men who would sacrifice innocent souls in their quest to rule all space and time. But now we are poised to crush them with the Hammer of Justice!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And when we do, they will know once and for all by whose hand the wheel of fate truly turns!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]”When the sun sets upon the battlefield, the foul System that rules the world will crumble! And from the flames, a new age will rise! An age of glorious, unfettered Chaos!” [%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Argh! Shut up!”[%p]
Kurisu gets fed up and rises from the sofa.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What are you talking about!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nobody can know the darkness in Okarin’s heart...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“First, get your character straight! What kind of mad scientist talks about the Hammer of Justice?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I guess he just got caught up in the heat of the moment. Maybe he regrets it now.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Come on, guys! Stop complaining and get ready!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Get ready?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“To crack SERN! Weren’t you listening?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Uh, I don’t think that’s a good idea.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When did you become a goody two shoes? Where’s your ambition!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you trying to get us arrested?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s not the problem!”[%p]
I fight the urge to grind my teeth.[%p]
Instead, I fix Kurisu with my stare.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s taken me so long -- [color index="A0140000"]so long[color index="800000"] -- just to reach this point!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is my chance to escape the Alpha worldline and save Mayuri. I won’t let anyone get in my way. Anyone!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“W-why so serious, man?”[%p]
I’ve got good reason.[%p]
To them, only half an hour has passed since the Time Leap Machine was built.[%p]
But to me, many days have passed since this ordeal began.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please!”[%p]
I bow my head deeply.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please, hear me out.”[%p]
Or else Mayuri will die, and in 26 years, the world will be ruled by SERN.[%p]
Suzuha’s sacrifice will have been for nothing.[%p]
Daru claps me on the shoulder, then smiles broadly and thrusts his thumb skyward.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I-it’s not like I’m cracking for you or anything, okay!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh god...”[%p]
I burst out in laughter.[%p]
Sir Super Hacka (tsundere version) is here to save the day. I couldn’t have asked for a better right-hand man.[%p]
As Daru hooks the IBN 5100 to his PC, I explain the situation one more time. Let’s hope this is the last.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This all happened because of the very first D-Mail I sent to Daru.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“SERN intercepted that D-Mail with Echelon and figured out what it meant, then sent their Rounders after us.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“They will kill Mayuri, kidnap us, and steal the Time Leap Machine.”[%p]
Some years after that, I assume, Daru and I escape and form the Resistance to which Suzuha belonged.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I tried to save Mayuri, but nothing worked. Every worldline converged on the same result, just as attractor field theory said they would.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You know, if this is all in your head, I think you’ve got a career as a [color index="820000"]light novel[color index="800000"] author ahead of you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s true. All of it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“To prevent Mayuri’s death...”[%p]
And to free Suzuha’s future from SERN...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We need to escape from the Alpha worldline. And I think we can do that by canceling all of our changes to the timeline so far.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That should return us to the Beta worldline, the worldline that existed before I sent that first D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s just one more step. We need to erase the first D-Mail from SERN’s database.”[%p]
If what Suzuha said is correct, then erasing that data will take us over 1% divergence and back to the Beta worldline.[%p]
It was just one short email, barely 36 bytes, but it changed the course of human history.[%p]
The Butterfly Effect. [%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Fascinating.”[%p]
Kurisu mutters as she sips her hot coffee.[%p]
It looks like she’s already recovered from her exhaustion.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You believe him, Makise-shi?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In theory. I’d like to see objective data, but that’s obviously impossible.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Relax. Your Time Leap Machine worked perfectly.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“O-of course it did.”[%p]
She doesn’t deny it. That’s just like Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Besides, we were already planning to crack SERN’s database, weren’t we?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Fine. Let’s see what’s in there. If the mail data exists, then it’s proof that what you said is true.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“So what you’re saying is, ’don’t think, feel.’ Got it.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Uh, you lost me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What he meant to say was, ’don’t think, do.’”[%p]
Daru extracts his massive body from the space behind the desk, plops himself down on the chair, and wipes away his sweat.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Done bridging them. I need to tinker with the settings a little, but we should be up and running in about ten minutes.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alright.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So the first D-Mail started everything...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Was that the one you showed me at ATF?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The one that said I died or something.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Right. I found you dead at Radi-Kan and sent Daru an email. Daru happened to be experimenting on the PhoneWave (name subject to change) at the time, so the discharge phenomenon occurred and the mail... was...”[%p]
My voice trails off.[%p]
Something is telling me to stop.[%p]
Fear rises in my chest, a sudden, terrible certainty that I am missing something vital.[%p]
I frantically replay the conversation in my head.[%p]
“We must cancel all of our changes to the timeline so far.”[%p]
“The very first D-Mail started it all.”[%p]
“The one that said I died or something.”[%p]
“Return to the worldline that existed before I sent the first D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
An icy fist seizes my heart, and I turn to Kurisu with a look of pure terror.[%p]
Our eyes meet.[%p]
Those eyes of hers no longer show the sharp defiance from when we first met.[%p]
Instead, they glow warmly with the light of curiosity.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What?”[%p]
I was right. I had missed something vital... something [color index="A0140000"]dire[color index="800000"].[%p]
The worldline I set my sights on to save Mayuri.[%p]
The worldline upon which Suzuha staked her hope for the future.[%p]
The worldline I am at last poised to reach at the end of this long struggle.[%p]
On that worldline, Mayuri lives.[%p]
On that worldline, SERN fails.[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]And on that worldline...[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]...on the 8th floor of Radi-Kan...[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]Makise Kurisu dies.[%e]
