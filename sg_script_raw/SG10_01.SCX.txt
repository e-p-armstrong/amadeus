I thought that I had found the solution, that everything would be alright.[%p]
But the equation was meaningless. I had solved nothing.[%p]
Instead, I am left with a terrible choice.[%p]
Mayuri.[%p]
Or Kurisu.[%p]
One of them must die.[%p]
Radi-Kan is still off limits.[%p]
They haven’t yet repaired the hole that Suzuha’s time machine made.[%p]
I look down through the hole at the streets of Akiba.[%p]
From up here, they look narrow and stifling.[%p]
Across the way, a train rumbles by. I watch the yellow-striped cars move past.[%p]
I came here because I wanted to be alone.[%p]
The day before yesterday, I abruptly canceled the attempt to hack SERN.[%p]
Kurisu and Daru demanded an explanation, but I just couldn’t give them one.[%p]
The decision has paralyzed me.[%p]
Two days later, I am still nowhere close to finding an answer.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
What do I do?[%p]
Two weeks ago, on July 28th, Doctor Nakabachi held a press conference in this very spot.[%p]
The same day, Kurisu was murdered.[%p]
Let’s say we go through with the plan and delete the first D-Mail I sent -- the one about Kurisu’s death -- from SERN’s database.[%p]
That would return us to the Beta worldline, where it all began. What would happen then?[%p]
According to my predictions, our friend, Lab Member 004...[%p]
Makise Kurisu would disappear.[%p]
Someone who died on July 28th cannot be alive now, on August 15th. That would defy causality.[%p]
A time paradox.[%p]
That worldline has already rejected her existence.[%p]
The moment we erase the D-Mail, Kurisu will cease to exist.[%p]
And so, I am left with two options.[%p]
Option One. Hack SERN with the IBN 5100 and erase the first D-Mail I sent, thus returning to the Beta worldline.[%p]
Kurisu will disappear, but Mayuri will live. SERN will never build a time machine, and the future will be free.[%p]
Option Two. Don’t hack SERN. Keep living here on the Alpha worldline.[%p]
Mayuri will die. So will Moeka and FB.[%p]
Kurisu will likely be kidnapped by SERN, but at the very least, she won’t die.[%p]
With her research, SERN will gain control of space-time, and the future will be a dystopia where no one is free.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And I’m supposed to choose?”[%p]
Ridiculous.[%p]
I choke out a laugh.[%p]
How am I, of all people, supposed to make that choice?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s no way...”[%p]
I don’t really care about the future, whether it’s free or ruled by SERN.[%p]
I know I should care. Suzuha entrusted her wish to me. Doesn’t that make it my responsibility?[%p]
But still, it doesn’t seem quite real. Twenty years is a long time.[%p]
Right now, only Mayuri and Kurisu matter. I must choose which to save.[%p]
If I had been given this choice back on July 28th, before this all started...[%p]
I probably would not have hesitated to abandon Kurisu and save Mayuri.[%p]
But it’s not July 28th. It’s August 15th.[%p]
I’ve spent two long weeks with Kurisu. She’s one of us now, an integral part of the lab.[%p]
And as I leapt through time again and again, she was the person I relied on most.[%p]
Always calm. Always thoughtful. Always ready with a new hypothesis. Always there to give me a push when I needed it most.[%p]
I wouldn’t even have the Time Leap Machine if not for Kurisu. It’s thanks to her that I made it this far.[%p]
After all she’s done for me, there’s no way I can abandon her now.[%p]
But nor can I let Mayuri die.[%p]
Everything I’ve done, I did to save her.[%p]
I would give anything, even my own life, to see her safe.[%p]
More than anything, I want her to live.[%p]
No matter what, I won’t let her die.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t choose... I can’t!”[%p]
Kill Kurisu, or kill Mayuri. That is what this choice comes down to.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is this how it ends!?”[%p]
I drive my fist into the wire fence.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha... Faris... Lukako... Moeka... Is this what I sacrificed your memories for!?”[%p]
Is there no other option? No way to save them both?[%p]
What if I use Suzuha’s time machine?[%p]
I could return to the Beta worldline, then use her time machine to travel to July 28th.[%p]
No, that won’t work.[%p]
The reason Suzuha leapt to 2010 was to prevent SERN from creating a dystopia. That only occurs on this worldline.[%p]
On the Beta worldline, she’ll have no reason to leap to 2010. Suzuha’s time machine won’t exist, so I won’t be able to use it.[%p]
Alright. Then what if I send Kurisu a warning via D-Mail?[%p]
It could say, “Don’t go to Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation.”[%p]
No, that won’t work either.[%p]
Remember, causality converges.[%p]
Kurisu’s death is inevitable on the Beta worldline, just as Mayuri’s is inevitable on this worldline.[%p]
No matter what I do, fate will ensure her death.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s no way...”[%p]
I slowly sink to the floor with my back against the fence.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I... can’t save her.”[%p]
I’m powerless against the will of fate.[%p]
What should I do?[%p]
What should I do!?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Maybe...[%p]
Maybe Mayuri doesn’t die on the current worldline.[%p]
I canceled Moeka’s D-Mail. Plus, I haven’t had an opportunity to check the divergence meter since.[%p]
Might there be a chance?[%p]
If the pattern continues, Mayuri’s death has been pushed back to the night of the 17th.[%p]
If Mayuri doesn’t die between 7 and 8 PM that night...[%p]
Then I won’t have to face this horrible decision.[%p]
I know it’s unlikely. I understand that from all my experiences so far.[%p]
But still, I can’t help but cling to that hope.[%p]
Mayuri and Kurisu.[%p]
If I can just save them both...[%p]
Then I don’t care if the future is ruled by SERN.[%p]
I’ll betray Suzuha’s dream, if that’s what it takes.[%p]
So please, let Mayuri live![%p]
To whom should I make this desperate plea?[%p]
God?[%p]
Fate?[%p]
The universe itself?[%p]
Either way, I am just one insignificant human among billions. Will my prayers truly reach?[%p]
I already know what the answer will be.[%p]
And that knowledge, that [color index="A0140000"]certainty[color index="800000"], is despair.[%p]
ComiMa runs for three straight days, from the 15th to the 17th.[%p]
On the last day, I go with Mayuri and stay with her from morning until ComiMa closes.[%p]
It’s not really my thing, though, and the crowd is ridiculous, so I wait off to the side with Mayuri’s bags. From time to time, Mayuri appears with new bags for me to guard, and usually a snack for us to share, but most of the day I spend alone.[%p]
To some extent, I’m here to escape reality -- to empty my mind and forget my fears.[%p]
But even when I close my eyes, I can still hear the footsteps of death approaching.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Haah, we’re finally home♪”[%p]
It’s already dark by the time the bus drops us back at Akiba.[%p]
Mayuri is dragging her costume case behind her.[%p]
I’m carrying bags covered in moe artwork and loaded with doujinshi.[%p]
These are all Mayuri’s purchases, not mine.[%p]
I can’t believe she bought so much. I guess the reason she doesn’t cosplay herself is that she’s too busy shopping.[%p]
We get off the bus and just stand there for a while.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you gonna do now? Head straight home?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Actually, I was thinking of going to the lab.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Need something?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Not really, but it’s been a while since I got to relax with Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m a little hungry, so I’ll buy some Juicy Chicken Number One on the way.”[%p]
Maybe Mayuri wants a taste of normalcy again, now that the chaos of ComiMa has ended.[%p]
I can’t begrudge her that.[%p]
I stifle a groan and shrug my shoulders.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Back to the lab, then.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, Okarin. Why did you come with Mayushii today?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’ve never come with me to ComiMa before. You’re not interested in moe, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I like robot anime.”[%p]
But not so much that I’d line up early in the morning for ComiMa each year, like Daru and Mayuri do.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So why did you come with me today?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well...”[%p]
“To confirm your death.”[%p]
Those words pop into my head, but I quickly shake them away.[%p]
Why am I so set on Mayuri dying?[%p]
I want her to [color index="A0140000"]live[color index="800000"], remember?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Well?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I just felt like it.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
Suddenly, silence.[%p]
A downhearted frown replaces the usual smile on Mayuri’s face.[%p]
Did my answer upset her?[%p]
But it’s not like I could tell her the truth.[%p]
How do you tell someone they’re going to die?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako...”[%p]
I frantically try to smooth things over.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I thought maybe you’d managed to get Lukako to cosplay, so I came to laugh at him. Too bad he didn’t come.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah... Luka-kun would be super popular if he did come, though.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“People would take his picture and post it all over the internet, then everyone in the world would see how cute he is!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And after he became a superstar, Mayushii would see him on TV and think, ’wow, he’s gone so far...’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s scary ’cause it’s true.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...Okarin?”[%p]
Suddenly, Mayuri turns around, and peeks at my face as she walks backwards.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Thank you for today.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why are you thanking me?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe! Well, like I said, this is the first time Okarin’s ever come to ComiMa with me.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It made Mayushii really happy♪”[%p]
A smile finally returns to Mayuri’s face.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ah, but you know what would make me even happier? If you cosplay next time!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yeah, I’ll think about it.”[%p]
That’s right. Don’t think negative thoughts.[%p]
Think about a fun, bright future.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really? You’ll cosplay for me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Only if you cosplay too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako too... and Christina, of course. Convince them to cosplay first.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If you manage that, then I, the great and insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, will grace ComiMa with my august presence.”[%p]
The next ComiMa takes place this winter.[%p]
We’ll all be there, as if none of this ever happened.[%p]
All of us, laughing and smiling together. Just imagine a future like that.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow... that’s gonna be tough.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But it sounds really fun too!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Besides, I think Chris-chan secretly wants to cosplay. So there’s hope♪”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s gonna do her best!”[%p]
We arrive at the lab.[%p]
I look up at the second floor, but there’s no light in the window.[%p]
Oddly enough, there’s nobody here today.[%p]
I’ve got a bad feeling about this.[%p]
Is Moeka going to ambush us?[%p]
On the previous worldline, I forgave Moeka and Tennouji.[%p]
But that has already been undone.[%p]
This is a new worldline. The Rounders are still alive, and they’re still after the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait here, Mayuri.”[%p]
I motion for her to sit and wait on the bench in front. Then I carefully check the area.[%p]
I know my efforts are likely futile.[%p]
But still, I want to do anything I can. Anything to give Mayuri a chance, however small, of surviving on this worldline.[%p]
Something tells me it would be foolish to go straight up to the lab.[%p]
So first, I decide to check the street for any suspicious people.[%p]
I walk down the street towards Kuramaebashi-dori, careful to always keep Mayuri in sight.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
Suddenly, a white station wagon parked at the end of the street fires its engine and takes off in our direction.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...”[%p]
I can see clearly through the front window. The man in the driver’s seat is unfamiliar.[%p]
But I have seen that station wagon before.[%p]
It’s the same one Moeka used to run us over on a previous worldline.[%p]
The same one Tennouji used to transport the IBN 5100.[%p]
And now it’s bearing down on me at full speed.[%p]
I’m in the center of the road. There’s nowhere to run![%p]
The station wagon flips on its high beams, instantly turning my vision white.[%p]
I can’t move. It’s all happening too fast.[%p]
I expected an ambush inside the lab. Instead, I’m facing a charging car.[%p]
What do I do!?[%p]
I’m fine. I won’t die. This worldline hasn’t approved that fate.[%p]
No, wait. What day is it?[%p]
This is the first time I’ve made it to the 17th. Does that mean my death is still undecided?[%p]
Will I die in Mayuri’s place?[%p]
If that will save her... if that will end this... then maybe it’s for the best.[%p]
No! I don’t want to die yet![%p]
Two contradictory emotions collide in my mind. My body doesn’t know which way to turn.[%p]
Will I be the one to die?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“!?”[%p]
Something slams into my back.[%p]
I open my eyes.[%p]
I’m lying on the side of the road.[%p]
My whole body hurts, but I don’t appear to be seriously injured.[%p]
Someone saved me?[%p]
I look up to see the station wagon’s taillights disappearing around the corner.[%p]
And there, lying in the center of the road... is Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri!”[%p]
I run to her side.[%p]
Mayuri is bleeding from the head. The pavement is slick with blood.[%p]
Did she... protect me?[%p]
But that’s not what I wanted![%p]
I lift her body up in my arms.[%p]
Her eyes twitch, then slowly open.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“O...kari...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri... I’m sorry. It’s my fault.”[%p]
Her hand wanders, as if seeking something.[%p]
It reaches for the starry sky.[%p]
Her eyelids are heavy. They could close any second now.[%p]
But still, she looks straight into my eyes.[%p]
And for some reason, she smiles.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Finally... Mayushii was...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“useful... to Okarin...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...t?”[%p]
Stardust Handshake.[%p]
Her delicate fingers grasp at the sky.[%p]
But all they find is empty air.[%p]
Her arm goes limp.[%p]
I grab her hand before it hits the ground.[%p]
Mayuri is no longer breathing.[%p]
I’ve seen her die countless times.[%p]
But this time, it’s too much.[%p]
This time, it’s all my fault.[%p]
I embrace Mayuri’s tattered body. Her lifeless, motionless, tattered body.[%p]
I clench my jaw and bite back my tears.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can’t see the stars from here...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How could this happen?”[%p]
Why did she have to die like this?[%p]
What possible meaning could this death have?[%p]
Yes, it happened because fate demanded it.[%p]
Yes, her death is unavoidable, the result upon which this worldline converges.[%p]
I knew from the beginning that this would happen.[%p]
But I never imagined that she would die saving me... and with a [color index="A0140000"]smile[color index="800000"] on her face.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean, you were finally useful? Tell me, Mayuri...”[%p]
There is no future for Mayuri on this worldline.[%p]
And that brings me once again to the choice.[%p]
Do I return to the Beta worldline, killing Kurisu?[%p]
Or do I leave things as they are, and accept Mayuri’s death?[%p]
I can’t run away.[%p]
I am the one who twisted fate.[%p]
I am the one who must decide.[%p]
