[margin top="228"][center]The sky is blue.[%e]
I’m on the roof of Radi-Kan, after going back 56 hours with two time leaps.[%p]
I lean against the wire fence and stretch out my legs as I look at the sky.[%p]
I wanted more time to think. That’s why I came back.[%p]
Last time, I spent two days refusing to face reality.[%p]
But that is no longer an option, now that I’ve confirmed Mayuri’s death.[%p]
This time, I need to reach a decision.[%p]
But how? This equation has no solution.[%p]
No matter what choice I make, someone dies.[%p]
From a purely utilitarian viewpoint, I should choose the Beta worldline, where SERN never creates a dystopia.[%p]
But it’s not that simple. Not for me.[%p]
There must be some other way.[%p]
According to Suzuha, 2010 is a point of great divergence at the attractor field level.[%p]
I think that divergence had already commenced by the time I sent the D-Mail reporting Kurisu’s death.[%p]
So when [color index="A0140000"]did[color index="800000"] divergence begin?[%p]
I can’t say for sure, but I think it was the moment we completed the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
That was around the middle of July. Daru and I deemed it a failure right after completion.[%p]
By the time Kurisu was killed, there was already a huge divergence at the attractor field level.[%p]
Now that I think about it, Reading Steiner activated that day, when I sent the D-Mail that started it all.[%p]
At that moment, every pedestrian and vehicle on the main street of Akiba suddenly vanished.[%p]
That feels so long ago.[%p]
But now, I can finally explain it.[%p]
That was the moment I moved to the Alpha worldline.[%p]
On the Beta worldline, where this all began, Suzuha didn’t arrive in her time machine. Doctor Nakabachi’s conference went ahead as planned, and the flow of tourists and shoppers through Akiba was unimpeded.[%p]
But when I sent the D-Mail, events changed on a huge scale. From my perspective, at least.[%p]
On the current worldline, Suzuha crashed her time machine into the roof of Radi-Kan. Nakabachi’s presentation was canceled, and this part of Akiba was closed to traffic.[%p]
Because I was out on the street when the worldline changed, it appeared to me as if thousands of people suddenly vanished.[%p]
The truth is that they were never there to begin with.[%p]
Like a magician’s trick, it’s so obvious once you understand how it works.[%p]
The real problem is the timing of the D-Mail.[%p]
I moved to the Alpha worldline after Kurisu died.[%p]
If I had sent the D-Mail [color index="A0140000"]before[color index="800000"] she died, then I might have been able to intervene, even now, on this worldline.[%p]
But no, that would defy causality. I sent that D-Mail because I saw Kurisu’s body. That’s the way it has to be.[%p]
Who killed her anyway? I still don’t know.[%p]
It definitely wasn’t suicide.[%p]
What if I identify the murderer and send them a D-Mail warning them off? Would that prevent her death?[%p]
I mean, no one has tried to kill her on this worldline, have they? Maybe there’s a chance.[%p]
However, to send that D-Mail, I would first have to move to the Beta worldline.[%p]
...The more I think about it, the more futile it seems.[%p]
I’ve already seen Mayuri die countless times. Everything I tried to prevent it failed.[%p]
I understand all too well.[%p]
When fate wants someone dead, nothing can stop it.[%p]
I can’t save Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There you are.”[%p]
I thought I was alone, but it seems that I was wrong.[%p]
I turn around to see Kurisu standing in the open door.[%p]
I avert my eyes. I can’t look her in the face, not now.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What are you doing here?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Nothing.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How did you know I was here?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You said you wanted to be alone. I ran the numbers and concluded that I had the greatest probability of finding you here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then leave me alone. You don’t have to look for me. I’m not a lost little boy.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“H-hey! Is that how you treat someone who’s worried about you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“N-not that I’m worried about you or anything!”[%p]
Right after she gets herself flustered, Kurisu sighs and puts on a serious expression.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I was going to leave you alone at first.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But you’ve been acting weird the last couple days. I mean, you’re always weird, but more than usual.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You look like a kid forced to eat crappy oatmeal. What happened?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nothing...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then why did you cancel the cracking of SERN?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re the one who said we shouldn’t.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh, so you’re afraid of triggering arrest flags. I get it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You should praise me for obeying the law for a change.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s not like you at all. What happened to your ego? What happened to the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyo--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“To hell with my ego!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This time, it’s not that simple.”[%p]
I have forced my ego on others before. Suzuha, Faris, Lukako... I sacrificed their dreams for the sake of my goal.[%p]
I justified it by telling myself that it was necessary to save Mayuri. I weighed their suffering against the alternative and made my self-righteous choice.[%p]
But this time, the alternatives are impossible to compare.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I have to choose which friend to let die. It would be so much easier if I [color index="A0140000"]knew[color index="800000"] what was right.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Which friend to let die? What are you talking about?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m just a student, Christina. You know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma? That’s just a fantasy. A character I made up. I bet you had no idea.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Uh... I may have figured that out when we first met.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When we first met...”[%p]
What if I hadn’t found Kurisu’s body back then?[%p]
Let’s try imagining that situation.[%p]
If I hadn’t seen Kurisu dead, I wouldn’t have interrogated her before the seminar at ATF.[%p]
Without hearing me call her a zombie, she wouldn’t have taken an interest in me. She wouldn’t have come to the lab.[%p]
Ultimately, we would never have built the Time Leap Machine, leaving me without the means to save Mayuri.[%p]
And of course, Kurisu would not have become our friend.[%p]
We would not be as close as we are right now.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Tell me, Okabe. What do you mean?”[%p]
I can’t meet her questioning gaze.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Do I have to tell you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’ve never hesitated to ask me for help before.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t hold back now.”[%p]
That’s not what this is about.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Then prepare yourself.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What I’m about to tell you is the absolute truth.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And it could also be... your death sentence.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...eh?”[%p]
Kurisu’s voice cracks a little.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Remember what I told you before? When we delete the D-Mail from SERN’s database, we’ll reach the Beta worldline, where Mayuri doesn’t die.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And where SERN doesn’t take over the world, right. Everyone lives. Everyone is free. You made it sound perfect.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Perfect? It’s anything but.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I showed you the first D-Mail, didn’t I? The one that started it all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“On the Beta worldline, the events described in that D-Mail actually happened.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu is a genius. I have no doubt that she understands.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu. On the Beta worldline...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You die on July 28th.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And according to the attractor field model, nothing can prevent that from happening.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If I want to save Mayuri, I have no choice... but to let you die!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu says nothing.[%p]
What expression is she making now?[%p]
I reluctantly sneak a look at her face.[%p]
She’s staring out across the cityscape.[%p]
Her eyes look distant. I see neither fear nor sadness in her face.[%p]
She seems... accepting.[%p]
Kurisu is always like this.[%p]
Always calm, no matter what.[%p]
It’s hard to believe she’s younger than me.[%p]
Her soft chestnut hair blows in the wind.[%p]
She lifts a hand to hold it down.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“How credible do you find this attractor field model?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Credible?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s all secondhand info from John Titor -- from Amane-san, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I get that it’s the accepted model in 2036.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But how exactly did scientists prove the existence of attractor fields?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you trying to say the model may be wrong? But I know for certain that convergence exists. I’ve experienced it firsthand.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Even if they’re right about convergence...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What about the relationship between worldlines?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The moment I change worldlines, everything is reconstructed. Past, present, and future.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But that’s just from your perspective, Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Once you go to the Beta worldline, the ’me’ that your brain perceives will die.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In other words, your perspective will have chosen the worldline where I die instead of the one where I don’t. However...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why can’t the world your brain perceives be different from the world my brain perceives?”[%p]
Brains. I forgot her specialty was neuroscience.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So you’re saying worldlines are independent?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Like trains, maybe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Trains?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Um, let me give you an easy example...”[%p]
Kurisu takes out her phone and starts fiddling with it.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If I want to take the train from Akiba to Yokohama, which route should I use?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I didn’t know you were a [color index="820000"]railfan[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s just an example. Geez.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You choose to take the Yamanote Line to Tokyo Station, then transfer to the Tokaido Main Line for the rest of your trip.”[%p]
Kurisu keeps talking as she looks at her phone, apparently reading off an itinerary.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But I take the Yamanote Line to Osaki, then transfer to the Shonan-Shinjuku Line.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Another person -- say, Hashida-san -- might decide to take the Keihin Tohoku Line for some reason.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And Mayuri might ride the Shinkansen from Tokyo.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You and I ride the same train until Tokyo Station. But from there, we ride different lines, while still aiming for the same destination.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And that applies to the universe? You’re claiming the existence of parallel worlds?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I like to use my imagination too, sometimes.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But where’s the proof that there’s only one world?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha said so... and then there’s Reading Steiner.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In other words, an unknown time traveler and your unexplainable super power.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But we knew Suzuha...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There’s no way to prove that she was Hashida’s daughter, or anything she said about 2036 either. Not without going there ourselves.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And if Reading Steiner is what you say, then it means that your subjective experience influences the memories of every single human being.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That’s completely absurd, Okabe. If it’s true, then you’re literally a god.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But there are no gods in reality.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The world doesn’t revolve around you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s just your brain making you believe that it does.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If that makes you this world’s god, then I must be a god too. My brain is just as big as yours.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you trying to say?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Let’s say you choose the worldline where I die. That doesn’t mean I have to do the same.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The fact is that I am standing here right now, observing the world with my own subjectivity.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I already exist on a worldline where I don’t die.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Even if your perspective shifts to the Beta worldline, my perspective might remain here.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s a question of where the soul lies. And I won’t let you have your way with my soul.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No true scientist would accept a hypothesis that flimsy.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But there’s a chance I’m right.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So you have nothing to worry about.”[%p]
Kurisu smiles.[%p]
How can she smile? I just told her that she’s going to die.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The problem is that you don’t want to let me die, right?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But if my hypothesis is correct, I’ll still be alive on another possible worldline.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So there’s no reason to be afraid.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s just a hypothesis.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The same is true of attractor fields.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It hasn’t been proven. Even if someone did prove it by 2036, that doesn’t help us here in the present.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In other words...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anything is possible.”[%p]
Kurisu turns her back to me after finishing.[%p]
It’s an armchair theory.[%p]
A daring armchair theory that could, quite possibly, render meaningless everything I’ve done up to now.[%p]
How can Kurisu stay so calm?[%p]
She’s just an 18-year-old girl.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You really don’t have to worry about me, Okabe. It would just hurt my pride if you did.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t say it like that.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Your phone’s ringing.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, yeah. It’s Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Answer it. I don’t mind.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Hello?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Ah...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Yeah...”[%p]
Displayed on the screen is Mayuri’s face, devoid of its usual brightness for some reason.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s wrong?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Um, I heard from Daru-kun that Okarin’s been acting kinda strange.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Mayushii was so preoccupied with ComiMa, she didn’t really notice...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Even though she usually notices right away when Okarin’s not happy...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“I’m sorry, Okarin.”[%p]
Don’t apologize.[%p]
You’ve done nothing wrong.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Um, did something happen?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Okarin?”[%p]
I can’t tell her. I can’t.[%p]
I’ve kept it a secret from her all this time. That’s the way it has to be.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s... nothing wrong.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Oh...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“You know, you used to talk to Mayushii about a lot of things, remember?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Like, umm, the Organization’s four leaders. Their names are Back Turkish, Virginian Burp, Balloon Drag Queen, and Wide-eye Gore, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Black Tortoise, Vermilion Bird, Blue Dragon, and White Tiger.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Yeah, that!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“You know, it was really fun talking to Okarin about stuff like that...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“But now...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Um, Okarin? If Mayushii’s a burden... just say so, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What!? I never...!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Ehehe. I’m hanging up now. If you feel like talking to Mayushii about anything, just call okay?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line][color index="8A0000"]“Tutturu♪”[%p]
She hung up on me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What did Mayuri say?”[%p]
The ringtone cuts off during my hesitation.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re such a wimp. I’m disappointed in you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Aren’t you afraid of dying?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Did you not hear what I just said?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I heard, but--”[%p]
An email interrupts me.[%p]
I don’t want to argue with Kurisu any more, so I open my phone to break the conversation.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How are you a burden!? Don’t say things like that, dammit!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why is she only serious at times like this!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“A burden, huh...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve never felt Mayuri was a burden. Not once.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then you should tell her that.”[%p]
Maybe it wasn’t a good idea to leave Mayuri in the dark.[%p]
She never looks like she’s thinking anything. And yet, she saw my doubt?[%p]
Either way, I can’t tell her the truth.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe.”[%p]
Kurisu sighs, then glares at me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The old you wouldn’t have worried about anything.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, you should go see Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m sure she has a lot to say.”[%p]
She’s right. Even if I don’t tell Mayuri the truth, I need to at least tell her [color index="A0140000"]something[color index="800000"].[%p]
I’ll postpone my decision, and go see Mayuri.[%p]
