It’s afternoon on the first day of ComiMa, and the crowds are finally beginning to thin out.[%p]
Of course, the industry booths and cosplay area are still packed, but at least I don’t have to wait in line to get in.[%p]
I’ve been trying to get in touch with Mayuri for a while now, but she hasn’t responded.[%p]
I checked with Daru, but he hasn’t seen her today either.[%p]
Cosplay ends at 4 PM. I focus on searching the cosplay area until then, but I still can’t find her.[%p]
Maybe she finished early and went home.[%p]
I try calling her home. No luck. They haven’t seen her since she left this morning.[%p]
Where is she?[%p]
I’m always afraid that she’ll disappear the second I take my eyes off of her.[%p]
It’s been like that ever since she lost her grandmother. [%p]
Maybe it’s just my imagination.[%p]
We’ve been so close for so long. I saw Mayuri at her weakest and most vulnerable.[%p]
Maybe that has made me overprotective.[%p]
But I don’t care how other people see us.[%p]
I just can’t leave Mayuri alone.[%p]
I step into the cemetery.[%p]
The final resting place of Mayuri’s beloved grandmother.[%p]
When was the last time I came here?[%p]
For about a year after Mayuri became my “hostage,” I’d periodically accompany her here.[%p]
But I don’t think I’ve been here since I entered high school. So it’s been about three or four years.[%p]
As I get closer to Mayuri’s grandmother’s grave, I begin to hear a voice.[%p]
It’s Mayuri. I’d recognize her voice anywhere.[%p]
It sounds like she’s talking to someone.[%p]
I approach quietly.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, Granny.”[%p]
Mayuri is standing there, talking to the grave.[%p]
What a relief. She hasn’t disappeared.[%p]
I decide to watch silently from a short distance away.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’ve been having scary dreams lately.”[%p]
For a second, I wonder if she’s learned to commune with the dead, but no, she’s just talking to herself.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“In my dreams, bad things keep happening to me.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Like someone shoots me, or a car hits me, or I get run over by a train...”[%p]
...What?[%p]
Don’t tell me...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s so real. It hurts so much, and I feel so sad, and I try to call for help but nothing comes out...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Why do you think I’m having these dreams?”[%p]
Does she... remember her deaths? [color index="A0140000"]All of them?[color index="800000"][%p]
Is she inheriting memories like I do?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And you know, they always end the same way...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s crying, and Okarin comes to save me.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii tries to say ’thank you, Okarin,’ but Okarin can’t hear my voice.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“He holds Mayushii, and makes a very sad face like he’s going to cry. But he never does, you know? I can tell he’s forcing himself not to cry.”[%p]
Come to think of it...[%p]
Both Faris and Lukako remembered their memories from before the past changed.[%p]
I used to think that memories couldn’t be shared between worldlines.[%p]
I used to think that I was the exception, with Reading Steiner.[%p]
But maybe that’s not the case.[%p]
Maybe everyone has the same power, and the only difference is how strong it is.[%p]
Maybe Reading Steiner is nothing special after all.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That makes Mayushii even more sad. I try to say ’sorry, sorry,’ but he still can’t hear.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And that’s when I wake up.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Why am I having these dreams?”[%p]
I’ve failed so many times to save her.[%p]
I’ve watched her die again and again.[%p]
Everything I’ve done has been to prevent that from happening.[%p]
And yet, have the memories of those deaths been tormenting her as she sleeps?[%p]
I bite my lip in frustration.[%p]
I still have a terrible decision to make.[%p]
Do I save Mayuri? Or do I save Kurisu?[%p]
There’s no perfect ending here. I can’t save them both.[%p]
It’s one... or the other.[%p]
If I choose Kurisu, then Mayuri’s dreams will become reality.[%p]
I don’t want Mayuri to feel any pain.[%p]
Until now, I’ve thought only of saving her.[%p]
That is my goal.[%p]
But at the same time, I can’t let Kurisu die.[%p]
Again, my thoughts hit the same dead end.[%p]
Mayuri hasn’t noticed me yet. She’s still staring at the sky, just as she was on the day I took her “hostage.”[%p]
She’s talking to her grandmother in heaven.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, right! We have a lot more lab mems now, you know!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“There’s Chris-chan, Moeka-san, Luka-kun, and Feris-chan. There’s also Suzu-san, but she moved away.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That makes eight of us. It’s really amazing.”[%p]
On this worldline, they all became lab mems. However, not a single one of them has sent a D-Mail.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You know, it was just Okarin and Mayushii at first.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Back then, Okarin seemed kinda bored most of the time.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But now, he’s having so much fun.”[%p]
Is that how she sees it?[%p]
Well... she’s not wrong.[%p]
She really does know me, doesn’t she.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And that makes Mayushii happy too!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s so busy, but it’s really exciting.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Especially now that Chris-chan is here. She’s really smart, you know. She got a paper published in a famous magazine!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii really admires her.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“She even made a time machine! Oh, but can’t forget Okarin and Daru-kun helped too.”[%p]
Then Mayuri falls silent.[%p]
Her gaze becomes distant.[%p]
She stands still, and looks up to the sky.[%p]
What could she be thinking?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But you know, sometimes I remember...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Back when it was just the two of us.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“When Mayushii had only just become Okarin’s hostage.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’d go to the lab after school, but Okarin wouldn’t be there. So I’d tidy up the room, and decorate it with cute things. Then Okarin would finally show up a little later.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii would say ’welcome back’. But instead of saying ’I’m back,’ Okarin would say ’Good work,’ like a big boss or something.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Every day, we’d spend a few hours just hanging out, doing nothing, and then we’d go home together.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“We didn’t talk much, but it wasn’t bad.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“We were just there... together, you know?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“We’d sit next to each other on the sofa. Okarin would work on his big plans, and Mayushii would read manga or play games.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And sometimes we’d have a snack together.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It was so nice and relaxing...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I never wanted to leave.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’d start feeling like a real hostage, and I’d laugh ’ehehe’ to myself.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Then Okarin would turn to me and say...”[%p]
I remember...[%p]
It was four months ago. Still spring.[%p]
The lab wasn’t as lively as it is now. It was an isolated bubble of slow-moving time.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did something good happen?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup. Well, not really, but kinda.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah, it must have been an illusion. We could be under attack from Illusion Conductor, one of the Organization’s feared agents.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh... gotta be careful, then. But you know, I’m sure that Mr.Illusion Kidhugger--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Conductor. Not Kidhugger.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m sure he’s not a bad guy.”[%p]
It was nothing. Just meaningless chatter to pass the time.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I felt so happy there.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So happy I could cry.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I wanted to stay like that forever.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ah! But that doesn’t mean I don’t like how things are now, okay?”[%p]
Mayuri shakes her head in denial.[%p]
Finally, she stops looking up at the sky, and bows her head instead.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You know, I haven’t talked to Okarin much lately.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Maybe Mayushii’s getting a little lonely.”[%p]
It’s true. I haven’t had time to talk to her lately.[%p]
But that’s because I’ve been fighting to prevent her death.[%p]
To keep her dreams from coming true.[%p]
All so that Mayuri will keep smiling.[%p]
I never again want to see her cry like she did on the day her grandmother died.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But you know, I don’t want to be a burden on Okarin.”[%p]
That word again. Burden.[%p]
I’ve never thought of her as a burden.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s just one big nuisance, isn’t she...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Granny?”[%p]
Mayuri lifts her face once more.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...I can’t stay like this forever, can I?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course you can!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh?”[%p]
When I finally speak to Mayuri, she turns my way with a surprised expression.[%p]
Her face is so soft, so innocent.[%p]
Slowly, her lips curve into a smile.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s Okarin♪”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow, how’d you know I was here?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I always know where my hostage is.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hostage...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You cannot escape my grasp. Not ever.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But don’t wear yourself out, okay?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s a little worried.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Hououin Kyouma is not so weak as to require your concern.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When the time comes, I’ll tell you everything.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So stay with me until then, like you always have.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...Okay.”[%p]
Mayuri stands up and turns to the grave once more.[%p]
As an offering, she leaves a brand new white lily, as well as some [color index="A0140000"]dango[color index="800000"] dumplings.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Let’s head back, Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Shouldn’t we get some dango for ourselves first?”[%p]
Back when we used to visit the cemetery together, it was part of our daily routine to eat dango on the way back.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe! Of course♪”[%p]
