Akiba is empty again today. The otaku have all made the Exodus to ComiMa for the second day of battle.[%p]
But come nightfall, they will return to Akiba like a victorious army laden with spoils, and the streets will be chaos.[%p]
I know Daru has gone to ComiMa. The question is, has Mayuri?[%p]
I hope she has. I want things to be normal again.[%p]
I remember what I heard yesterday. The feelings Mayuri expressed at her grandmother’s grave.[%p]
The events of the last few weeks have affected her as well.[%p]
After I escorted Mayuri home from the cemetery, I spent the whole night wracking my brain for a third option, a way out of this mess.[%p]
My thoughts were a jumble, ideas coming and going too fast to judge which were right and which were wrong.[%p]
But of course, there isn’t a right choice here.[%p]
For in the end, it always comes back to the same question. Who do I let die?[%p]
And no matter how I try to dance around it, the answer is always the same.[%p]
I can’t choose.[%p]
Is there no one else who can make this decision?[%p]
No. Even if there were, I know I’d never accept their choice. Whichever it happened to be.[%p]
Once again, I’m heading for the roof of Radi-Kan.[%p]
I had to get out of the lab. Mayuri or Kurisu might return at any moment, and I can’t face them now.[%p]
I look up at the sky. The clouds are dark and heavy.[%p]
It could start raining any minute now.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
I thought that I was alone, but someone was here before me.[%p]
Kurisu is lying in the middle of the roof, arms and legs spread as if making a snow angel.[%p]
The image of Kurisu in a pool of blood flashes through my mind.[%p]
Is she alright!?[%p]
I run towards her, but before I make it halfway, she suddenly sits up and turns to face me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re alive...”[%p]
What a dumb thing to say.[%p]
Fortunately, it looks like Kurisu didn’t hear me. She’s busy combing her disheveled hair with her fingers.[%p]
I breathe a silent sigh of relief.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Right. I forgot I might run into you here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What were you doing?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Thinking.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh...”[%p]
Was she thinking about her death?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I don’t know what to say, so I keep my mouth shut.[%p]
Kurisu appears to be in the same boat. She’s staring at the capsule toy dispenser in the corner, her face wearing the usual frown.[%p]
The awkward silence drags on.[%p]
When you think about it, Kurisu’s fate rests in my hands.[%p]
My decision will determine whether she lives or dies.[%p]
Her fantastic hypothesis yesterday was a desperate attempt to construct a scenario where she doesn’t die.[%p]
Even if she believes that her theory is correct, it must be difficult for her to avoid imagining her own death.[%p]
I force a smile. I’m getting really uncomfortable here.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Looks like I’m in your way, so I’ll just go.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Oh, okay.”[%p]
Damn. I was expecting a sarcastic remark like “Since when do mad scientists have manners?” or something.[%p]
Just then, something cold lands on the tip of my nose.[%p]
When I look up, raindrops start landing on my forehead.[%p]
An evening shower. It’s only going to get more intense, and quickly.[%p]
Kurisu hasn’t moved a muscle.[%p]
She’s just standing there with her arms folded, staring at the ground as if she doesn’t notice the rain at all.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey. It’s raining.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Huh? Oh, yeah.”[%p]
She’s acting strange, like her mind is elsewhere.[%p]
I knew it. She’s been thinking about...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whoa!”[%p]
In less than a minute, the rain turns into a full downpour.[%p]
We had no time to seek shelter.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What the hell!?”[%p]
Kurisu’s scream is drowned out by the roar of the rain.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Whew, what a surprise.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s what you get for tempting the sky gods.”[%p]
Now safely inside the building, we take a moment to catch our breath.[%p]
It’s been a week since Suzuha’s time machine disappeared, but Radi-Kan is still closed. The lights are off, and it’s pretty dark inside.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You should’ve warned me sooner. Even my underwear’s soaked.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Same here. I bet you’re glad it’s dark, huh?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If the lights were on, I’d be able to see everything.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...!”[%p]
Even in the dim light, I can tell that Kurisu is scrambling to cover her chest.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ugh, I forgot that you’re a perv too.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re the one who announced that your underwear was wet.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“J-just drop it! If you’re imagining what color my underwear is, I’ll kill you!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not imagining anything.”[%p]
She’s too self-conscious.[%p]
But... the color of her underwear, huh?[%p]
Hmmm... gotta be white.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Achoo!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Cold?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m not stripping naked, if that’s what you’re suggesting! Your pervy tricks won’t work on me!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who said strip!? Calm down, will you!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Grr...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But if you want to strip, go right ahead. I can’t make out your scrawny figure in this light anyway.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Another word, and I’ll make you eat your cerebral neocortex with ponzu sauce!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“S-sorry.”[%p]
Please, spare me that horror.[%p]
Still, these wisecracks are a welcome distraction.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“A storm like that shouldn’t last long. Guess we’ll just wait it out.”[%p]
I see Kurisu’s shadowy form move to sit on the staircase. I sit next to her.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“H-hey, get your own stair!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“W-what?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re the one who said not to speak.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Y-you’re too close...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t come any closer, okay? You can stay where you are, but come any closer, and I’ll push you away, okay?”[%p]
Our bodies gradually grow cold. We start shivering.[%p]
Maybe I should take off my wet clothes.[%p]
But if I do that, Kurisu will just call me a perv again.[%p]
Better not.[%p]
My eyes gradually adjust to the darkness.[%p]
I can see Kurisu more clearly now.[%p]
She’s huddled up against the wall.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Don’t look at me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Impossible! How can you see where I’m looking!?”[%p]
Does she have infravision!?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So you [color index="A0140000"]were[color index="800000"] looking.”[%p]
Damn! She used Leading Question on me.[%p]
That’s such a high-level technique.[%p]
I avert my eyes from Kurisu and take off my lab coat.[%p]
That’s when I notice my coat is torn at the shoulder.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Damn. Must have caught on something when we ran inside.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What are you talking about?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just a little tear in my coat.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Is clumsiness one of your character traits?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t be ridiculous. I am a mad scientist. I bear the curse of insanity, not clumsiness.”[%p]
It seems like forever since I’ve talked to Kurisu as “Hououin Kyouma.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yeah, yeah.”[%p]
Kurisu suddenly holds out her hand.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Give it here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I happen to have a sewing kit with me. I’ll stitch it up for you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A sewing kit? You?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Something wrong with that?”[%p]
I hand over my coat as asked.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re an experiment-loving girl. You’re not supposed to be... [color index="A0140000"]domestic[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Can’t I be a domestic experiment-loving girl?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You? Domestic?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Relatively, maybe. Well, actually, I don’t know the domesticity index for Japanese high school girls these days.”[%p]
There’s an index for that? First I’ve heard of it.[%p]
Kurisu skillfully threads the needle, despite the darkness.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s wet, so it’s kinda hard to thread.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Did you really just happen to have that on you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Get over it already. Is it really so wrong for me to have a sewing kit?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not wrong. It just seems like you planned for this.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So you’re saying I brought it with me because I somehow knew your coat was going to get ripped. Uh-huh.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ridiculous.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And before you get the wrong idea, I’m not fixing your coat because I want to or anything, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nice tsundere line.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t mock me. You just happened to tear your clothes, and I just happened to have a sewing kit handy when you did. It’s coincidence. That’s all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Coincidence...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey... you didn’t time leap, did you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So now you’re saying that I went back in time for the sole purpose of repairing your stupid lab coat. Uh-huh.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ridiculous. Ridiculous! There. It’s so important I said it twice. Comprendes?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re right. If you had time leaped, you would’ve brought a towel, not a sewing kit.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What’s that, sarcasm? All you do is complain.”[%p]
After working for a while, Kurisu cuts the string with her teeth, then hands me back my coat.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thanks.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Um, by the way... it was dark, so I couldn’t really see.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If it turns out bad, it’s not my fault. It was dark. That’s all.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh, and I hope you like the color. Because I have no idea which thread I used.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s... random?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Black, red, or pink. Those are the three possibilities.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s just hope it’s not pink...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Achoo!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Cold?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I guess.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Take my coat.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But it’s wet.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, yeah, but...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Silence again.[%p]
The words flow so naturally when it’s just harmless banter, but one second of silence, and suddenly we have nothing to say.[%p]
It must be because of what happened yesterday. I’m so desperate to avoid the topic that [color index="A0140000"]nothing[color index="800000"] seems safe.[%p]
I know I need to say something, but what?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Have you made your decision yet?”[%p]
Her voice is barely a whisper, but I can hear her clearly in the silence of the empty stairwell.[%p]
I look at Kurisu. She’s hugging her knees to her chest, presumably against the cold.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
My decision.[%p]
I know what she means.[%p]
That’s why I can’t answer.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Sigh... You still haven’t made up your mind?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You like Mayuri, don’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
Where did [color index="A0140000"]that[color index="800000"] come from?[%p]
Kurisu keeps staring into the darkness.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s probably just my imagination, but lately, I’ve been seeing things. Like a strange sort of deja vu.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“In these visions, you’re fighting to save Mayuri all by yourself. You never give up, no matter how much it hurts.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu, too?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then you come to me for help. You’re so desperate, so earnest, that I just have to do what I can.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“N-not that I’m doing it for you, okay!? I just want to save Mayuri, that’s all.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, these images are stuck in my head, like memories.”[%p]
So Kurisu’s the same. She still has faint memories from previous worldlines.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I tried self-analysis. Maybe I’m mistaking dreams for reality, projecting my hopes and fantasies... I don’t know.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But there’s one thing I [color index="A0140000"]do[color index="800000"] know.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You have to save Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Aren’t you afraid?”[%p]
To save Mayuri, I must undo the current worldline.[%p]
If I do that, Kurisu will die.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You know, it kinda feels like we’re trapped in an ancient ruin.”[%p]
Kurisu suddenly changes the subject. She looks around the dark, empty stairwell.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Like the world ended...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And we’re the only two people left.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ve been thinking.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Say you go to the Beta worldline, and everyone else goes with you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What if I can’t go with you? What if I’m the only one left behind?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Would the entire world become like this place?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s just a theory... but I can’t help but wonder.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I...”[%p]
I need to say it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll save you. Not just Mayuri, but--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t make promises you can’t keep!”[%p]
Kurisu cuts me off sharply, then buries her face in her knees.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You asked me if I wasn’t afraid.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Of course I’m afraid.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Maybe I’ll disappear. Maybe I’ll be left behind all alone.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Or maybe only you will disappear and everything else will stay the same.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The world will continue, and nobody will even know that you existed. I’ll go back to America as if nothing ever happened.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Maybe... maybe... maybe!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I feel hopeless, just thinking about all the possibilities.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But even so!”[%p]
Kurisu raises her head and spears me with her glare.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Do you think I would tell you to let Mayuri die!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Jesus, it’s cold!”[%p]
Kurisu grabs her own arms.[%p]
In the darkness, I see her shoulders shaking.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s because of these wet clothes! This sucks.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Anyway, enough of this nonsense. It’s nothing but conjecture. Baseless. Worthless. I want to cut open my skull and excise the part of my brain that comes up with these delusions.”[%p]
Now she’s talking to herself in an angry tone.[%p]
Kurisu has always been calm when faced with the unknown. I admired her for that.[%p]
I thought she was facing this calmly too.[%p]
But I was wrong.[%p]
Behind her cool facade, she was struggling to cope with the knowledge that her very existence was in jeopardy.[%p]
She was fighting that fear all alone, and now it has finally come to the surface.[%p]
Of course she’s afraid.[%p]
However brilliant she may be, she’s still just an 18-year-old girl.[%p]
Kurisu abruptly stands up.[%p]
I realize that I no longer hear the sound of rain pounding on the roof.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Listen, Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You can’t save both of us. Correct?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No matter how you struggle, it’s one or the other.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No buts. My answer won’t change.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Save Mayuri.”[%p]
I hear the pain in her voice... and also the resolve.[%p]
Kurisu has made up her mind.[%p]
I look away and clench my fists. My nails dig into the palms of my hands.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you telling me to give up!? To abandon you!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I could never do that!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You can, and you must! There’s no other way.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No! You’re our friend! I won’t abandon you!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe!”[%p]
Kurisu drops to her knees and grabs me by the collar.[%p]
I gasp for breath as she stares into my eyes.[%p]
Her eyes are hard and stern.[%p]
It’s always like this when she scolds me.[%p]
Always the same glare...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Is there another solution? There isn’t, is there?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t want to live if it means sacrificing Mayuri!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you don’t save her, I’ll never forgive you!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Guh...”[%p]
This can’t be happening![%p]
I hate this choice with no right answer.[%p]
I hate the universe for being so cruel.[%p]
And most of all, I hate myself for forcing Kurisu to speak these words when she is the one with the most to lose.[%p]
Tears well up in my eyes, but I bite my lip and hold them back.[%p]
Is there really no other way?[%p]
I can’t bear it.[%p]
I look straight back at Kurisu as she holds me by the collar...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh...?”[%p]
And tightly embrace her slender body.[%p]
Her clothes are still wet from the rain, but all I feel is warmth radiating from the core of her being.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But you’re right here!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why does it have to be this way!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe...”[%p]
Tension drains from her back and her hands.[%p]
She gives her whole body to my embrace.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thank you. I know you’re hurting for me.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But you’ve done enough. I’m fine, so just think about Mayuri, okay?”[%p]
Despite her fear, Kurisu has made her choice.[%p]
It’s time for me to do the same.[%p]
I need to decide, here and now.[%p]
The future of the world.[%p]
Which friend to let die.[%p]
Holding Kurisu tightly, I whisper into her ear...[%p]
