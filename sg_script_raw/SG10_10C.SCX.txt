[name]Rintaro[line]“I won’t give up. Ever!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Kuh!”[%p]
Kurisu suddenly pushes me away.[%p]
She steps back. Her face is hidden behind her hair.[%p]
But her fists are trembling. Her body exudes raw fury.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This is ridiculous! You... [color index="A0140000"]motherfucker[color index="800000"]!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whoa!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I said I was fine! What do you mean you won’t give up!? Are you stupid? Wanna die?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you trying to be a hero, you chuunibyou wackjob? Don’t make promises you can’t keep!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Your stupidity is infuriating! Why can’t you just do as I say!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What’s the problem, huh!? If you weigh the options logically, saving Mayuri is the only--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Fuck logic!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...!”[%p]
Kurisu stares at me in shock.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not God! Maybe I got close, but that’s not me!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t decide who lives and who dies anymore!”[%p]
Suzuha.[%p]
Faris.[%p]
Lukako.[%p]
I sacrificed their happiness to save Mayuri.[%p]
And the whole time, a voice in the back of my head was asking...[%p]
Is this really okay?[%p]
What gives me the right?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This time...”[%p]
This time, I want to save both of them, without sacrificing anyone.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hmph!”[%p]
Kurisu turns away with a frown, then starts tapping her foot in a clear gesture of displeasure.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There’s nothing you can do. It’s the choice of Steins Gate. Isn’t that what you always say?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The equation is proven, Okabe. There’s no escape.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re just one man. No matter how hard you try, you can’t overcome the will of the universe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know... but I’m still going to try!”[%p]
I won’t lose Mayuri or Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Kuh...”[%p]
I hear Kurisu grinding her teeth.[%p]
Then she turns her back to me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Have it your way! But I’m not helping. I’m going back to America, and that’s that.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Goodbye. I don’t expect we’ll meet again, Hououin Kyouma.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kuh...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I can’t believe this! How stupid can you be? You’re so... stupid!”[%p]
Kurisu disappears down the stairs, muttering insults until I can no longer hear her.[%p]
Now alone, I sigh into the darkness.[%p]
Kurisu is absolutely right.[%p]
I can’t think of a single way to save them both.[%p]
I’m a fool.[%p]
And yet, I have to try.[%p]
But this time, I won’t have Kurisu’s help.[%p]
I have to fight the universe alone.[%p]
How do I save both Kurisu and Mayuri?[%p]
I can’t use D-Mail. Too much could go wrong.[%p]
I don’t want to make the same mistakes again.[%p]
In the end, all I can do is time leap.[%p]
Time leaping can’t save Mayuri, but at least it can delay her death, give me time to find a solution.[%p]
On this worldline, Mayuri dies at half past seven on the night of August 17th.[%p]
That’s about 26 hours from now.[%p]
My battle has no end in sight.[%p]
If only Suzuha were here, I could have asked her for advice.[%p]
But even alone, I must find a way.[%p]
So resolved, I start time leaping again to save Mayuri.[%p]
I’ve done this before. When Mayuri died the first time at Moeka’s hands, I tried time leaping to prevent her death.[%p]
But I only tried running away that time. This time, I try every approach I can think of.[%p]
I try hiring bodyguards to protect Mayuri.[%p]
I try taking Mayuri to South America -- an entire world away from Japan.[%p]
I try crippling SERN with attacks on their servers, the ones that don’t need the IBN 5100.[%p]
I try getting Mayuri admitted to a hospital. It’s hard, given Mayuri’s perfect health, but I manage. My goal is to keep her from dying by heart attack.[%p]
I try everything I can possibly imagine.[%p]
However.[%p]
Every plan fails.[%p]
Mayuri dies, again and again and again.[%p]
Sometimes it’s murder, sometimes an accident.[%p]
But every time I leap, Mayuri dies.[%p]
Maybe it really is impossible to resist fate.[%p]
As long as I remain on this worldline, Mayuri can’t be saved.[%p]
Fate will kill her every time.[%p]
From Mayuri’s perspective, she only dies once.[%p]
But I have seen her die dozens of times.[%p]
All because of me.[%p]
And yet, it no longer affects me as it used to.[%p]
Little by little, I have grown desensitized to her death.[%p]
In the beginning, I felt unbearable pain every time I saw her die, and murderous rage towards the ones responsible. Now I feel nothing.[%p]
The realization stuns me.[%p]
After dozens of leaps, I finally realize what should have been obvious from the beginning -- I never leap back more than 26 hours.[%p]
Why?[%p]
I could go back as far as August 11th -- one whole week in the past.[%p]
Yet I never do.[%p]
Why?[%p]
Because I know that even if I do, nothing will change.[%p]
I [color index="A0140000"]don’t believe[color index="800000"] that anything will change.[%p]
Every time Mayuri dies, I find myself thinking, “Another failure. What went wrong this time?”[%p]
I calmly analyze Mayuri’s death, then take my data and head for the Time Leap Machine with a sigh, like a gamer forced for the umpteenth time to restart a particularly difficult stage.[%p]
I’m just going through the motions. I didn’t even realize, until this moment, how routine it had all become.[%p]
Now that I have, my actions suddenly seem meaningless.[%p]
I can’t take another step.[%p]
And that’s how I find myself here, sitting motionless in front of the Time Leap Machine. I’ve been staring at it for hours.[%p]
When we got caught in that evening shower on the Radi-Kan rooftop, my clothes got soaked. But now they’re completely dry.[%p]
My body temperature has dropped, but I don’t have the energy to warm myself with a shower.[%p]
I sluggishly get to my feet and pick up the headset.[%p]
The sight of it fills me with resignation.[%p]
Resignation. That’s all.[%p]
There is no desperate drive to save Mayuri, no hope that this time I might succeed.[%p]
Those emotions are long gone.[%p]
In truth, they have been gone since my argument with Kurisu. Deep down, I always knew that she was right.[%p]
I pretended not to see it. I told myself that the Time Leap Machine could solve everything. [%p]
But that was just an excuse, a last attempt to satisfy my ego.[%p]
In the end, all I’m doing is--[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Running away?”[%p]
I turn around in surprise, and there I see Kurisu standing in the doorway.[%p]
I thought she never wanted to see me again.[%p]
Why is she here?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why...”[%p]
Kurisu ignores my question and fixes me with her usual glare.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Time leaping is just running away.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
You don’t have to tell me. I already know.[%p]
I know all too well.[%p]
In the end, all I’m doing is running away. Running from responsibility. Running from the decision.[%p]
If I had known I would have to make this choice, then I would have refused Suzuha when she entrusted me with her mission.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve hurt people... lots of people... just to save Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And yet, I don’t even feel guilty anymore.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I feel like I’m losing my humanity.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Then why are you hesitating now?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Maybe because my insurance, the Time Leap Machine, isn’t effective.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Or maybe I just haven’t mastered it yet. Maybe I haven’t tapped into its full potential.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Running only makes it hurt more.”[%p]
She suddenly looks away.[%p]
Then she leans against the wall and smiles bitterly.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I should know.”[%p]
Is Kurisu running too? From what?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Look at yourself, Okabe. You look like you’ve aged a decade.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Your heart can’t take it anymore. You don’t need to beat yourself up like this. Just accept the truth.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Like I said, you can’t stay here.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Go to the Beta worldline. Go to the world where Mayuri doesn’t die.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Not just for your sake, but for mine as well.”[%p]
She’s right. I have no other options left.[%p]
No more D-Mails. No more time leaps.[%p]
There’s no perfect world where both Kurisu and Mayuri live.[%p]
Maybe there are things I have yet to try, but I’m certain that all of them will end in vain.[%p]
As long as I stay on this worldline, Mayuri will die.[%p]
And if I go to the Beta worldline, Kurisu will die.[%p]
We’ll never be able to talk like this again.[%p]
It’s only been twenty days since we met, and yet...[%p]
Memories of Kurisu flash before my eyes.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thank you. I know you’re hurting for me.”[%p]
So much has happened these past twenty days.[%p]
We argued. We exchanged insults.[%p]
We made incredible discoveries together, and when confronted with the implications, we shared our fears.[%p]
Whenever I hit a dead end in my struggle to save Mayuri, I always turned to Kurisu for help. She always listened. She always believed me.[%p]
And I helped her too, when she was distraught over her father.[%p]
We promised to go to Aomori together.[%p]
Without this girl genius on our side, we would not have the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
Proud, passionate Makise Kurisu. Always strong, or at least pretending to be. A little nosy, too, and serious to a fault.[%p]
Before I knew it, she had become the center of the lab.[%p]
From the very beginning, I was attracted to her radiant confidence.[%p]
I found myself mesmerized by her every gesture. Hanging on her every word.[%p]
I listened enraptured whenever she presented her latest theory.[%p]
At the end of the day, the reason I never called her by her name... was because I was too embarrassed.[%p]
I admired her. I longed for her. And I didn’t want to admit it to myself.[%p]
Only now do I realize the truth.[%p]
I love her.[%p]
And that is why I want so desperately to save her.[%p]
She’s not just a fellow lab member.[%p]
To me, Kurisu is far more than that.[%p]
And yet, I have no choice.[%p]
In the end, everything she said was right.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...can’t save you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry...”[%p]
In a desperate attempt to hold back my tears, I bite my lip tightly.[%p]
The taste of blood spreads through my mouth.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why does it have to be you? Why!?”[%p]
I pound my fist on the table.[%p]
Silence.[%p]
Nothing moves.[%p]
Outside the window is only darkness.[%p]
Is this what it’s like to be the only person left in the world?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Once you go to the Beta worldline, Mayuri and Hashida will forget the time we spent together, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu’s cheeks start to redden, and she turns away.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Will you... remember me?”[%p]
Her voice is barely a whisper.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course I’ll remember you. Of course I will!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s no way I could ever forget the girl most important to me!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh? Y-you mean...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wh-what the hell are you saying!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The truth.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“B-but... proof. I need proof. I can’t come up with a formula otherwise!”[%p]
Kurisu is getting flustered for some reason.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“When the anterior pituitary gland hypersecretes [color index="820000"]ACTH[color index="800000"], and gamma waves induce stochastic resonance, we can assume an infinite Hausdorff dimension for the Hilbert curve.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“That is, we can measure the asymptotic line with positron emission tomography...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu.”[%p]
I speak her name. Our eyes meet.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I love you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...!”[%p]
Kurisu looks away. Her face is bright red.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh!? Wh-what!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do you, uh... How do you feel about me?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Y-you want to know?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu suddenly looks me straight in the eye. Her face is still red, but her expression is firm.[%p]
She walks straight up to me, grabs me by the collar, and jerks me towards her.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Close your eyes!”[%p]
Did I make her mad?[%p]
Perhaps Kurisu hates me for some reason.[%p]
Maybe she really [color index="A0140000"]did[color index="800000"] mean all those insults she’s said to me.[%p]
That would be really sad...[%p]
I slowly lick my trembling lips, and timidly try to ask a question.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why close my--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Just shut up and close them!”[%p]
I do as I’m told, though I still don’t know why she’s so angry.[%p]
My collar is still in Kurisu’s grip.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“nn...”[%p]
Abruptly, I feel a soft sensation against my lips.[%p]
The faint scent of citrus tickles my nose.[%p]
When I open my eyes in surprise...[%p]
I see Kurisu’s face scant millimeters away.[%p]
And then I understand what has happened.[%p]
She’s kissing me.[%p]
Her lips are very warm.[%p]
My mind goes blank.[%p]
I’m unable to think.[%p]
I want to stay like this forever.[%p]
But soon, our lips separate.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu looks down shyly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha... wha...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I-it’s not like I did it... because I wanted to or anything.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s just... you promised... that you wouldn’t forget about me.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Research shows that memories are harder to forget when coupled with intense emotions.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Y-you’re a virgin and a perv, so I was sure you’d have an [color index="820000"]elaborative rehearsal[color index="800000"] on your first kiss, instantly making it a long-term memory you’d never forget... so...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I just don’t want you to forget about me, Okabe. No matter what.”[%p]
My heart fills with love for Kurisu as she makes her frantic excuses.[%p]
What a relief. Kurisu wasn’t mad. She was just trying to hide her embarrassment.[%p]
I want to be with her even more. I want to talk with her even more.[%p]
I want to learn even more about her.[%p]
But I know that wish can never come true.[%p]
My chest tightens. I feel like I’m suffocating.[%p]
Desperate to keep my emotions under control, I place my own hands on top of Kurisu’s, which are still grabbing my collar.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“S-sorry to disappoint you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...eh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That wasn’t my first kiss.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“W-why you... You’re just a cherry boy!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Shut up, virgin.”[%p]
I remember playfully kissing Mayuri in elementary school.[%p]
And just a little while ago, I forcibly kissed Moeka to silence her.[%p]
But that was on another worldline, and now it never happened, so... I guess it doesn’t count?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So it wasn’t your first...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Right. So it only left a weak impression. Probably not enough to become a long-term memory.”[%p]
I’m lying, of course. I’ve never felt such an intense kiss as that.[%p]
The shock was like a lightning bolt to the brain.[%p]
But still, I’m lying.[%p]
Because if I miss this opportunity, I’ll never be able to touch Kurisu again.[%p]
This is my last chance.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So, once more.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wha...”[%p]
Kurisu fidgets. She usually glares at me harshly, but now she’s avoiding my eyes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t ever want to forget... so let’s make doubly sure.”[%p]
I decide to take the initiative. I wrap my arm gently around Kurisu’s waist and pull her slender body against mine.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Th-then I guess there’s no choice...”[%p]
Kurisu looks up at me shyly.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Just a kiss... okay?”[%p]
What is she worried I’ll do?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Be gentle... okay?”[%p]
I run my fingers softly through her hair.[%p]
Then I slowly bend down...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Mm...”[%p]
We’re both shy, so we end up pecking at each other’s lips like two small birds.[%p]
Then we draw back and look at each other.[%p]
Kurisu’s eyes are wet. Tears are running down her cheeks.[%p]
I kiss them away.[%p]
They’re salty.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t forget me...”[%p]
We press our lips together again.[%p]
Stronger than the first time. Longer than the first time.[%p]
I never want to let go.[%p]
We embrace each other tightly, our feelings too powerful to contain.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“mm...”[%p]
We seek each other’s warmth again and again.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Locked in our embrace, we feel each other’s breath.[%p]
We feel each other’s scent.[%p]
We feel each other’s taste.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s too fast...”[%p]
Kurisu’s whisper resonates through our embrace.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Time is going by too fast.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I could really use a word with Einstein right now.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Time is not absolute.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Einstein proved that time could be fast or slow, depending on the observer.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“The theory of relativity is so romantic...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...and so sad, don’t you think?”[%p]
How does Kurisu feel about me?[%p]
In the end, she never really answered my question.[%p]
Early morning, Akihabara Station.[%p]
Kurisu is standing before the entrance with her huge suitcase beside her.[%p]
She waves to me shyly as I approach.[%p]
Then she blushes and shoots me her usual glare.[%p]
After that kiss, Kurisu went back to her hotel to pack. That suitcase must hold everything that she brought to Japan.[%p]
She’s going back to America.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Well then.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you sure I shouldn’t call Mayuri and Daru?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I think that would just make it harder.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But you, I have no trouble leaving behind.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...That was a joke.”[%p]
Kurisu looks like she’s about to cry.[%p]
I’m sure I look just as sad.[%p]
But I won’t cry.[%p]
I don’t have that right.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is a souvenir. Take it.”[%p]
I hand her Future Gadget No. 2: The Bamboo Helicam.[%p]
It’s a bamboo helicopter equipped with a CCD camera, which allows it to record video in the air. A truly groundbreaking invention.[%p]
But sadly, due to its constant high-speed rotation, the video it produces tends to cause motion sickness.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Uh... no thanks.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just take it. It’s not even that bulky.”[%p]
I wanted to give her Future Gadget No. 7: Ghost in the Ball, but it was too big.[%p]
Kurisu accepts Bamboo Helicam with a strained smile.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Oh, fine. I guess I’ll take it.”[%p]
And then, silence.[%p]
No words of farewell.[%p]
We just look at each other.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry I couldn’t go with you to Aomori...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But these two weeks were fun, in their own way.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Give my regards to Mayuri and Hashida, okay?”[%p]
Kurisu spreads her arms wide.[%p]
Without a moment’s hesitation, I step forward, and embrace the girl genius one last time.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hang in there, Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Stay well.”[%p]
Kurisu smiles faintly, then turns and walks toward the entrance with suitcase in hand.[%p]
I watch her go, unable to move a muscle.[%p]
I want to stop her.[%p]
I want to wrap my arms around her and tell her to stay with me forever.[%p]
But I can’t.[%p]
This is what we decided.[%p]
To save Mayuri.[%p]
To save the future.[%p]
I’m sorry, Kurisu.[%p]
I can’t save you.[%p]
Kurisu will disappear.[%p]
She’ll be left behind on this worldline.[%p]
There is no place for her in the coming world.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I will remember you, Makise Kurisu. I will remember your warmth.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I will never forget!”[%p]
I don’t know whether Kurisu hears my words.[%p]
She keeps walking.[%p]
Stride steady.[%p]
Back straight.[%p]
Long, silky hair fluttering in the wind.[%p]
She’s quickly fading into the distance.[%p]
But I can tell.[%p]
I see her shoulders trembling.[%p]
We will never meet again.[%p]
Our worldlines will never cross again.[%p]
I’m glad I met you, Kurisu.[%p]
I would have been lost without you.[%p]
I love you.[%p]
Goodbye.[%p]
I stand there in the entrance as commuters file past, until long after she has vanished from sight, afraid that any motion, any thought...[%p]
Might cause the tears to fall.[%p]
