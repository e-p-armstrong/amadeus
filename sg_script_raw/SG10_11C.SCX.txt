[name]Rintaro[line]“The time has come. We will now commence the final phase of Operation Verthandi.”[%p]
Mayuri and Daru turn to me and nod.[%p]
Today is the last day of ComiMa. Daru wanted to attend, of course, but a little begging convinced him to prioritize the operation.[%p]
I take a look around the lab.[%p]
These twenty days have been madness. It’s incredible to think that at one point, this lab had a whole eight members.[%p]
And now we’re back to three.[%p]
The memories we made.[%p]
The experiences we shared.[%p]
To save Mayuri, I will undo them all.[%p]
There is sorrow in me. And guilt.[%p]
I engrave them deep inside my heart.[%p]
I’ll never forget -- I mustn’t forget -- these long, yet short summer days.[%p]
But still, I choose to erase our memories. I choose to return everything back to normal.[%p]
Suzuha’s mission is irrelevant. I’m not doing this for the future.[%p]
As long as Mayuri lives, nothing else matters.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru. You may begin.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...You sure?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okey-dokey!”[%p]
Daru starts typing on the IBN 5100. It’s already connected to his main computer.[%p]
This will get us into SERN’s central database, where they keep the data they mine with Echelon.[%p]
There we will locate the first D-Mail I sent on July 28th, and erase all trace of its existence.[%p]
With this, I can reach the Beta worldline.[%p]
At last, Mayuri will be safe.[%p]
I look at Mayuri. She’s on the couch, sitting straight as a ramrod, with her grandmother’s pocket watch pressed to her ear. She stays still, her eyes closed.[%p]
Whenever Mayuri wants to calm down, she listens to the sound of that pocket watch.[%p]
Earlier, I told Mayuri everything.[%p]
I guess she’s come to terms with it, in her own way.[%p]
The actual work, I’ve left to Daru. No problem there.[%p]
While waiting for him to finish, I walk into the development room.[%p]
In the center of the room is the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
I squat down and gently brush my fingers against the microwave’s surface.[%p]
It’s cool to the touch.[%p]
I’ve made irreplaceable friends because of this thing. And because of this thing, I’ve hurt them.[%p]
But I don’t want to blame the tool.[%p]
It’s how you use the tool that matters.[%p]
And I’ve got to admit, it’s saved me more than once.[%p]
But still.[%p]
Once this is over, I’ll destroy the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
We must never make the same mistakes again.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin, I found it! It’s really there!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The D-Mail I sent? It’s there!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It sure is, man.”[%p]
Daru points to a string of characters.[%p]
My name is there, followed by the message I wrote about Kurisu’s death.[%p]
Three lines total, each twelve characters long.[%p]
This data led SERN to our doorstep.[%p]
At FB’s instruction, Moeka and the Rounders attacked.[%p]
If Suzuha is right, then by erasing this data, we will escape from Attractor Field Alpha, where SERN dominates the future.[%p]
That will take us to Attractor Field Beta.[%p]
To the Beta worldline within its range of convergence.[%p]
To a future without Mayuri’s death.[%p]
Mayuri is standing next to me, gazing intently at the monitor.[%p]
She grasps my hand firmly.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s okay.”[%p]
She looks anxious, so I pat her head to calm her down.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Everything’s set. One press of the enter key, and that data’s gone.”[%p]
Daru stands up and gestures to the open seat.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I leave that honor to you, Okarin.”[%p]
I sit down and face the keyboard.[%p]
This time.[%p]
This time, it ends.[%p]
Kurisu’s face floats through my mind.[%p]
I close my eyes and take a deep breath.[%p]
...Goodbye, Kurisu.[%p]
Slowly, I raise my right hand and extend my index finger.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Victory is at hand!”[%p]
Daru twitches at my cry.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“With unimaginable brilliance and unwavering conviction, I have defeated our vast and powerful enemy and now stand triumphant on the field of Ragnarok!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I give thanks to the comrades... whose sacrifice made this victory possible!”[%p]
One press of this key, and Kurisu will die.[%p]
I firmly grip my coat at the shoulder, where it has been stitched together with jagged pink thread.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The coming world... is the world I wished for!”[%p]
I wished for Mayuri to live, and Kurisu to die.[%p]
That is the truth. And I must never forget it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is the choice of Steins Gate!”[%p]
This is the choice of Okabe Rintaro.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let the world be reborn!”[%p]
I swing down my index finger.[%p]
And at the exact same time, I hear the lab door open.[%p]
My eyes dart towards the sound.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“--!”[%p]
There, in the doorway, stands Kurisu.[%p]
Her face is flushed. Was she running?[%p]
Why is she here?[%p]
She should be on her way to the airport right now.[%p]
Kurisu is looking at me.[%p]
Her eyes are glistening, but her face is all smiles.[%p]
Did she come back for me?[%p]
In a split second of frozen time, I imagine I hear her voice.[%p]
“We didn’t say goodbye,” she says.[%p]
Immediately afterward, my finger strikes the enter key.[%p]
The world starts to warp.[%p]
The timeline is being rewritten.[%p]
I feel my consciousness being sucked into the vortex.[%p]
Reading Steiner.[%p]
Divergence is changing.[%p]
The warp accelerates.[%p]
Kurisu.[%p]
Daru.[%p]
Mayuri.[%p]
Everything inside the lab is shifting.[%p]
Color fades as my consciousness leaves this worldline.[%p]
I turn to face Kurisu, desperate to burn this last sight of her into my eyes.[%p]
She raises her hand.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Goodbye.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe, I lo--”[%p]
