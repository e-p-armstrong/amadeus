The world gradually stops spinning.[%p]
Little by little, color returns.[%p]
I look to the door.[%p]
She was standing there just a moment ago.[%p]
My assistant, Christina... Makise Kurisu.[%p]
Now she is gone, vanished like a dream.[%p]
I look around the room.[%p]
Next to me is Daru.[%p]
Behind me is Mayuri.[%p]
Everything is where it should be.[%p]
It looks like nothing has changed at all.[%p]
I gently touch my coat’s shoulder, where Kurisu fixed a torn seam.[%p]
...It’s gone.[%p]
My coat isn’t torn.[%p]
The stitches, uneven from having been sewn in the dark, have disappeared.[%p]
There’s no trace of that ridiculous pink thread.[%p]
I stand up and head to the development room.[%p]
Underneath the table, the Time Leap Machine...[%p]
No.[%p]
That’s not the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
That’s the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
The upgrades Kurisu made are gone.[%p]
Nothing has changed. This world is exactly the same.[%p]
In all respects save one.[%p]
Kurisu... was never here.[%p]
Every trace of her has vanished.[%p]
Kurisu is nowhere now.[%p]
Nowhere, except in my memories.[%p]
Mayuri and Daru are looking at me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Hey, who was Lab Mem 004 again?”[%p]
I need to ask.[%p]
Even though I know what the answer will be.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin, there isn’t a 4th lab mem, remember?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Are you going to introduce a new member? Requesting cute girl.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...No.”[%p]
I knew that it would be like this.[%p]
But the fact that they forgot her existence is so saddening. So frightening.[%p]
I am the only person in the world who remembers Makise Kurisu as Lab Member 004.[%p]
So I won’t forget.[%p]
I alone will live with her memory engraved upon my heart.[%p]
...Now, time to proclaim my triumph.[%p]
There are still things that must be done.[%p]
And many sacrifices were made to get here.[%p]
But despite all that, this is my victory.[%p]
I have won.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh... heh heh... MUHAHAHAHA!”[%p]
Mayuri and Daru stare in wonder at my abrupt laughter.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The last battle of Ragnarok is won!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I, the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, with an IQ rivaling that of Einstein himself, have thwarted the Organization, outsmarted SERN--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And conquered the whole of space and time! Now, at the moment of my triumph, I stand before you as a god!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This brave new world is the fruit of my ambition! The hated System shall collapse, and chaos shall rule the Earth!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This truly is the choice of Steins--”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin.”[%p]
Mayuri suddenly throws her arms around me.[%p]
I freeze, utterly taken aback.[%p]
Daru looks as confused as I am.[%p]
Mayuri looks up at me and smiles.[%p]
It’s the gentlest smile I’ve ever seen.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s okay now.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha... what are you saying? I must proclaim our glorious victory, that all may--”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But Okarin... you look like you’re about to cry.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You don’t have to try so hard, okay? I know you’re doing it for me, but I don’t want to be a burden.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So you don’t have to pretend anymore, okay?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“If you’re hurting, just say so. Like normal Okarin would.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But... I...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You don’t have to worry about Mayushii anymore.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii is fine.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So you can cry if you want to, okay?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I don’t know what happened...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But it’s okay to cry now.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
And just like that, the mask shatters. All it took was one word from Mayuri.[%p]
Mayuri, the sister I never had, the girl who always needed my protection.[%p]
I had to save her. That was my purpose.[%p]
I even sacrificed the girl I loved.[%p]
But now, I finally realize that it’s over.[%p]
Mayuri is safe.[%p]
I’m... free.[%p]
Once more, I see Kurisu’s face in my mind’s eye.[%p]
I recall the warmth of her body.[%p]
The softness of her lips.[%p]
The weight of her last words.[%p]
One by one, they pound against my heart.[%p]
I can’t bear it anymore.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whoa, man. Are you really crying?”[%p]
My vision blurs.[%p]
Tears run down my cheeks.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I... I...”[%p]
A tidal wave of emotion crashes over me. Nothing remains to hold it back.[%p]
I’ll never see Kurisu again.[%p]
That knowledge shreds my heart.[%p]
I can’t hold back my sobs.[%p]
I can’t stop my tears.[%p]
This is the world I’ve been searching for.[%p]
A world where Mayuri does not die.[%p]
And yet, it is missing the person most precious to me.[%p]
It’s too much.[%p]
It’s too cruel.[%p]
Why did it have to be Kurisu?[%p]
Why was I forced to choose?[%p]
Why did she send me off with a smile!?[%p]
I cling to Mayuri.[%p]
She strokes my hair gently.[%p]
I surrender to my grief.[%p]
Three days have passed since then, and Mayuri is still alive.[%p]
Moeka and the Rounders have not attacked, and Tennouji has shown no sign of moving against us.[%p]
Daru has been visiting MayQueen as usual, while Mayuri has been working on costume designs for next ComiMa. Everything is back to normal.[%p]
Everything... save for the hole in my heart.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Phew. That’s that.”[%p]
I’m standing by the dumpster out back of the lab.[%p]
We just finished dumping the last of the trash.[%p]
This morning, I called Daru, and together we dismantled the PhoneWave and the IBN 5100.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Man, what a waste. That thing was worth a fortune.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And now we don’t have a microwave...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“How will Mayushii eat her Juicy Chicken Number One?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Come on. I’ll get you a new microwave.”[%p]
We no longer need the PhoneWave, that miraculous time machine built by coincidence.[%p]
It brought Kurisu into my life.[%p]
But at the same time, it made many people suffer.[%p]
It must never be used again. Not by me. Not by anyone.[%p]
It’s time for the PhoneWave to die. And with it, the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, lord of space and time.[%p]
I recall what Kurisu once said.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t want to deny who I’ve been. Because even my failures are a part of who I am today.”[%p]
I gaze once more upon the scrap heap that was Future Gadget No. 8.[%p]
We stripped it down to the last bolt and circuit board. Surely no one can rebuild it now.[%p]
Time travel is too much power for any human to wield.[%p]
We don’t need D-Mails or time leaps.[%p]
Even if nothing in the future is guaranteed.[%p]
Even though I may die tomorrow.[%p]
Life was never meant to be redone.[%p]
And that’s fine by me.[%p]
Wouldn’t you say so too, Kurisu?[%p]
I look up at the sky, and even though it’s the middle of the day, I can see a single star shining.[%p]
Maybe it’s Venus.[%p]
Which suddenly reminds me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Going to the past is possible right now. Look into the sky at night, and you can see how things were tens of thousands of years ago.”[%p]
Every night, we casually travel through time.[%p]
That’s what Kurisu said.[%p]
And each and every word she spoke, I carve into my heart.[%p]
So that I’ll never let them slip from memory.[%p]
For as long as my life endures.[%p]
