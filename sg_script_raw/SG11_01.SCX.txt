She said to meet her on the roof of Radi-Kan.[%p]
When I get there, I find it cordoned off. The roof was off-limits to begin with, but now it’s also part of a crime scene. As if I needed another reminder of the murder that took place here three weeks ago.[%p]
I duck under the yellow tape and open the door.[%p]
The lock is still broken.[%p]
I can hardly breathe after running up the stairs to get here. As I gasp for air, I look across the stark white concrete.[%p]
And naturally, my eyes go straight to the satellite sitting smack-dab in the middle of the roof.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No way...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow! What’s that?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s a robot, right? The transforming kind?”[%p]
Mayuri and Daru are just as surprised.[%p]
What is that thing?[%p]
I mean, it [color index="A0140000"]looks[color index="800000"] like Suzuha’s time machine.[%p]
But there’s something different about it.[%p]
Suzuha’s looked old and beat up. This one looks brand new.[%p]
It’s not stuck in the wall, either.[%p]
And besides, this is the Beta worldline, where SERN’s dystopia never forms. Suzuha has no reason to travel to 2010.[%p]
That satellite shouldn’t be here.[%p]
And yet, I feel like I’ve seen it before.[%p]
Where?[%p]
When did I...[%p]
Of course! It was at Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation![%p]
Right before the presentation started, something shook the building like an earthquake. And when I went to check the roof, this satellite was sitting there.[%p]
Though still confused, I approach the satellite.[%p]
Just then, the hatch opens, and someone steps outside.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah...!”[%p]
[name]???[line]“...”[%p]
[name]???[line]“...Okabe Rintaro?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha!”[%p]
It really is her.[%p]
The part-time warrior.[%p]
John Titor.[%p]
Time traveler from 2036.[%p]
Daru’s daughter, who will be born 7 years from now.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why are you here!?”[%p]
I asked her the same question over the phone, but I can’t help myself. I need answers.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Are you Okabe Rintaro? I need to know.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-yeah...”[%p]
The way she puts it makes it sound like she’s never met me before.[%p]
And now that we’re talking face to face, I realize that there’s something very different about her.[%p]
For starters, what’s with all the camo?[%p]
It looks dirty and worn, like she’s been fighting in it for a while.[%p]
She’s even carrying a gun, for some reason, and I’m pretty sure it’s not a replica.[%p]
Is she really Amane Suzuha?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hold on. Just hold on one second.”[%p]
This doesn’t make sense![%p]
No, calm down. Figure this out, Okabe.[%p]
You know that this is impossible.[%p]
Suzuha [color index="A0140000"]can’t[color index="800000"] be here.[%p]
She leapt to 1975 in her one-way time machine. She found the IBN 5100, made sure it would get to you, then passed away in the year 2000.[%p]
So where did this girl come from?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m a time traveler from the year 2036. I have a request for Uncle Okarin.”[%p]
U-Uncle!?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’re an uncle?”[%p]
We don’t have time to humor Mayuri’s question.[%p]
Suzuha walks up to me and looks me in the eye. Her expression is grim.[%p]
The next words out of her mouth are the last thing I expected to hear.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“This worldline is headed for World War Three!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I need your help to prevent it! Please, help me change the future!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha... what the...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What the hell are you talking about!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“World War Three? Oh no! That’s really bad!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Uh, are you really a time traveler? You’re not just messing with us here?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Stay out of this, Dad.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“D-Dad!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“W-whoa... that was a shock. I mean, it’s not every day a mysterious beauty calls me dad. Though to be honest, I’d prefer to be called big brother.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait! Everyone just wait! Let me think!”[%p]
I take a deep breath. Okay... let’s figure this out.[%p]
I turn to Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is that thing a time machine?”[%p]
Suzuha nods curtly.[%p]
She hasn’t smiled once. There’s no hint of the cheerful Suzuha I remember.[%p]
Instead, I sense strength, conviction, and steel resolve.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your father built it?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s right.”[%p]
Suzuha glances at Daru.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where did you come from?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The year 2036.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I stopped in 1975 and 2000 first.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You... what?”[%p]
That doesn’t make any sense.[%p]
She’s obviously not in her 40s.[%p]
Which means...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That time machine can travel to the future!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It wouldn’t be much of a time machine otherwise.”[%p]
This isn’t the Suzuha I know.[%p]
But it [color index="A0140000"]is[color index="800000"] Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re... from a different future?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“A different future?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s going on in 2036? What about SERN’s dystopia?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“SERN? What’s that?”[%p]
Suzuha frowns.[%p]
She doesn’t know about SERN?[%p]
That settles it. She’s definitely not the Suzuha I know.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You said something about World War Three?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Right. In my time, humanity has been reduced to less than a billion people.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Less than a billion? But the population now is like 6.7 billion. Are you saying 5.7 billion people died!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s what happens when you use nuclear weapons.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It was just like the Cold War. Only this time, they were fighting over time travel technology.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It started with a race between the EU and Russia. Then the Americans got involved, and things really went to hell.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“They were all desperate to stop anyone else from being first to build a time machine. Whoever controls time controls the world, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Time travel again...[%p]
It has the power to grant your dreams, and at the same time, destroy everything you love.[%p]
I know that better than anyone.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“By 2036, the war’s over, but it left the Earth in ruins. We won’t survive for long, not as things are.”[%p]
It’s unbelievable.[%p]
In the future of the Alpha worldline, SERN used their time machine to fashion a dystopia where no one could oppose their rule.[%p]
Suzuha traveled to the past to change that. She showed me how to escape that convergence.[%p]
The result is this, the Beta worldline. Here, SERN fails to complete its time machine.[%p]
But instead, 5.7 billion people die in the fires of nuclear war.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This can’t be happening...”[%p]
My legs fold beneath me. I sink to my knees. [%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Are you okay?”[%p]
Mayuri kneels beside me and gently rubs my back.[%p]
But I’m too stunned to respond to her kindness.[%p]
I glare at Suzuha. Though I know it’s absurd, part of me blames her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why is this happening!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You lied to me! You said a peaceful future was waiting for us on the Beta worldline!”[%p]
We saved Mayuri. We changed the future.[%p]
And now, after everything we did, Suzuha appears before me once again to say that it wasn’t enough!?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“We’re at a point of great divergence, when--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know that already!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Then you understand! 5.7 billion people are going to die, and the survivors will be left with no future! No hope!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I came here to prevent that. And to do that, I need your help, Uncle Okari--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I refuse!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“--!”[%p]
I reject her plea outright.[%p]
Suzuha looks hurt, betrayed, like an abandoned puppy.[%p]
How dare she look at me that way?[%p]
I borrow Mayuri’s shoulder and struggle back to my feet.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I came here from the Alpha worldline. I had to sacrifice the girl I loved to make it this far!”[%p]
I can’t go back. Not to the worldline where Mayuri dies.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t care if 5.7 billion people die! I won’t let her... I won’t let Kurisu’s sacrifice be in vain!”[%p]
One person versus 5.7 billion.[%p]
They can’t be compared.[%p]
Suzuha is staring at me in disbelief.[%p]
Mayuri and Daru clearly don’t know what to say. I haven’t told them what happened, so they can’t understand.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Wait. You mean you’ve been to another attractor field?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Wow. So that’s the power of Reading Steiner.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...How do you know about that?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Dad told me. And I’ve met you before, Uncle Okarin. In the future, that is.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’ve... met me?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I see... so the me of that attractor field went to the past too...”[%p]
A faint smile flickers across her face, then she looks at me with renewed intensity.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle Okarin. I know you don’t want to, but--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No. I won’t let Kurisu’s death be in vain. I won’t let Mayuri die.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh? Mayushii dies?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“By Kurisu, I assume you mean Makise Kurisu?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Listen, Uncle.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Let’s say -- hypothetically -- that the only way to change the future of this worldline is to go to July 28th, 2010, the day Makise Kurisu dies...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...and save her. What would you do?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What!?”[%p]
Shock ripples through my body.[%p]
What did she say?[%p]
Save... Kurisu?[%p]
But how?[%p]
We no longer have the PhoneWave or the Time Leap Machine. And even if we did, I could never leap that far back.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah...!”[%p]
Of course.[%p]
I look over Suzuha’s shoulder, at the object disguised as a satellite.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your time machine... We can use your time machine!”[%p]
It came all the way from 2036. It should have no trouble going back a mere three weeks.[%p]
Even better, this time machine can do what Alpha Suzuha’s could not.[%p]
It can travel to the future.[%p]
I can go to July 28th, save Kurisu, and return to the present.[%p]
No D-Mails. No time leaps.[%p]
Genuine physical time travel![%p]
I can’t refuse.[%p]
I [color index="A0140000"]literally[color index="800000"] can’t refuse.[%p]
I saw this time machine once before. On July 28th, that fateful day.[%p]
Shortly before Kurisu was killed, I saw it standing in this very spot, as sure as it is standing before me now.[%p]
There’s only one thing that can mean.[%p]
It has already been established that this time machine will appear on that day, in this place.[%p]
Even before I sent the first D-Mail, my participation was assured. Even the thought of turning Suzuha down now is meaningless.[%p]
Nothing is coincidence. Everything is inevitable.[%p]
The revelation makes me dizzy.[%p]
It’s like I don’t have the tiniest atom of free will, like my every action from the moment of my birth was planned for me by some cosmic force.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The worldline I’m aiming for isn’t... what did you call it? The Alpha worldline? It’s not that.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What we’re aiming for...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Is the space between attractor fields.”[%p]
The... space between?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“There lies a worldline unaffected by any attractor field.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“A worldline known as Steins Gate.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...”[%p]
But that’s the chuuni name I pulled out of my ass! It doesn’t even mean anything![%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I was told that Steins Gate is a brand new worldline, one no one has ever observed.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But didn’t someone have to observe it to know it’s there?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Nope. It’s never been observed. That’s what makes it new.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But Dad and Uncle Okarin were able to calculate its divergence.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“-0.081609% relative to the current worldline.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s where we’ll find Steins Gate.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And to reach that worldline, we have to save Kurisu?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Exactly.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“She’s the key to averting World War Three. As long as she lives, the war won’t happen. Or at the very least, 5.7 billion people won’t die.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why Kurisu? I mean, I know she’s a genius, but are you telling me she’s the hero who’ll save 5.7 billion people?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...I don’t know.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You don’t know? And you expect me to go along with this!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hey, I’m just following Dad’s plan.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And apparently, you’re the one who came up with it in the first place.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If there’s a flaw in your plan, then we’re all in trouble.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It sounds like you didn’t hear it from me. Is that right?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You passed away ten years ago -- 15 years from now, that is. The year 2025.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
The same result as on the Alpha worldline.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So I don’t know the whole story. What I do know is that my dad continued your work. After you died, he built this time machine all by himself just to see your plan through.”[%p]
That’s my super hacka...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...?”[%p]
He must have hacked into SERN and stolen their research, then used it to construct his own time machine.[%p]
On the Alpha worldline, SERN killed Daru before he could complete the machine.[%p]
But here, Daru was able to perfect his design. That’s why it can go back to the future.[%p]
At least, that seems the most likely explanation.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Like I said, Steins Gate is unobserved. Nobody knows what future awaits us there.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“There’s a chance that a dystopia rises from the ashes of World War Three.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“There’s a chance that Makise Kurisu dies just two days after you save her.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“There’s a chance that you don’t die in 2025, but next week.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But there’s also a chance that when 2036 comes, there will be no dystopia, no world ravaged by war.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“There’s a chance that everyone, including Makise Kurisu, will still be alive.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“There’s a chance that a wonderful future awaits.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“At least it won’t be the future I came from. And it won’t be the future the other me came from. That much is certain.”[%p]
Is an unknown future really for the best?[%p]
I would hate for the ending roll to say, “Despite your best efforts, you made everything worse.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s completely unknown, completely unpredictable.”[%p]
Kurisu can’t be saved. I [color index="A0140000"]know[color index="800000"] that. Even if we change the past, convergence will ensure her death, just as it did for Mayuri.[%p]
It’s impossible. There’s no way this plan can succeed.[%p]
In the end, fate will win, as it always has.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But if you’re willing to try. If you’re willing to come with me to July 28th...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Then take my hand.”[%p]
I look down at Suzuha’s hand. Her skin is rough, her palm calloused. [%p]
This cool, collected, unsmiling Suzuha comes from a ruined world, from the ashes of a war that claimed over five billion lives. I can only imagine what she’s been through.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu...[%p]
How I have dreamt of saving her. I would do anything -- [color index="A0140000"]anything[color index="800000"] -- to change her fate.[%p]
But how do I know this invitation won’t lead me into another maze of despair?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Mayushii doesn’t understand any of this...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But this Makise person was very important to you, wasn’t she?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I think you should go for it!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“5.7 billion people, man. I can’t even imagine.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But don’t sweat the small stuff. Just save the girl, and you’re set for life! It’s the dream of every otaku!”[%p]
Mayuri and Daru offer me encouragement.[%p]
But it’s not enough to overcome my doubt.[%p]
The Makise Kurisu we knew -- Lab Member 004 -- is already gone.[%p]
Even if I save her on this worldline, she won’t remember any of the time she shared with us.[%p]
So there’s no point![%p]
I won’t bend time to my convenience. Not again.[%p]
I’m not God. I don’t have that right.[%p]
If I try, I’ll just end up making things worse![%p]
Reason pleads with me to stop.[%p]
And yet.[%p]
I look at Suzuha’s outstretched hand.[%p]
And then, with resignation...[%p]
I grasp it firmly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m in.”[%p]
Try though I may to fight it, this choice was made for me on July 28th, the moment I laid eyes upon this time machine.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Fate wants me to take your hand. Who am I to argue?”[%p]
I’m not at all confident that I can save Kurisu. How many times have I tried to resist fate only to fail?[%p]
I don’t want to see her die.[%p]
But if there is a chance, however small, that she can be saved, I have to try.[%p]
Even if I can’t take back what we had, I want more than anything to save her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s go.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Thank you, Uncle Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hop aboard!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can this thing even fit two people?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Of course it can. It’s my Dad’s masterpiece!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, your daughter really loves you.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I don’t get it, but stop calling me Dad. I’d rather be your big brother, if you know what I mean.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Be sure to come back, okay? I don’t want you to disappear, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not going to another world. It’s just a short hop to the past.”[%p]
I pat Mayuri’s arm reassuringly.[%p]
Then I follow Suzuha to the time machine’s hatch and slip inside.[%p]
