The interior is cylindrical and surprisingly tight.[%p]
When I sit down on the ledge that rims the cylinder, it puts me face-to-face with Suzuha, kind of like one of those giant teacup rides.[%p]
There are fewer controls than I expected. The inside definitely looks more refined than what I saw of Suzuha’s time machine on the Alpha worldline.[%p]
But one thing remains the same: the time display panel, a black screen with red lettering. I guess that’s just Daru’s taste.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Give me your phone.”[%p]
When I hand it over, Suzuha casually tosses it out the hatch.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s better not to bring it. It’ll cause interference.”[%p]
Interference?[%p]
Oh, I see. We’re going to July 28th. So there’ll be two of me, and if I bring it, two of my phone.[%p]
I guess that could be a problem if I got a call or something.[%p]
So time travelers really do need to be careful about what they bring to the past.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Shut the hatch.”[%p]
I hear Mayuri and Daru cheering outside. Mayuri caught my phone, thankfully.[%p]
I give them a final nod, then close the hatch.[%p]
Silence engulfs us.[%p]
Suzuha is operating the time display panel.[%p]
She sets our destination. July 28, 2010. 11:50 AM.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That should do it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s cutting it awfully close.”[%p]
I remember that Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation began at 12.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“This time machine can’t physically move.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Meaning?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No matter what time we travel to, we’ll always arrive at the exact same coordinates. In other words, on the roof of Radi-Kan.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I mean, it’s a little more complicated than that, but there’s no time to explain.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Anyway, we could leap to the day before the presentation. But if we attract too much attention, they could close Radi-Kan and cancel the presentation. That’s why we’ve gotta cut it close.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle, this is your first time time traveling, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Okay, first, stop calling me Uncle.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And yes. I’ve made more time leaps than I want to remember, but I’ve never time traveled before.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“According to John Titor, the G-forces are pretty strong. You feel like you’re being stretched out.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Yeah, I wrote that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The John Titor stuff?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Right. Back when I leapt to 2000.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see...”[%p]
The past has changed -- changed [color index="A0140000"]back[color index="800000"], I suppose, from my point of view.[%p]
When I was on the Alpha worldline, I saw Titor post on @channel in real time. On this worldline, those posts were made to an English BBS in the year 2000.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You don’t sound surprised.”[%p]
Nothing can surprise me now. My brain’s too busy trying to process all this new information. It feels like it’s gonna blow. [%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ll go over the mission one more time. Once we arrive, there’ll be no time for chitchat.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The objective is to prevent Makise Kurisu’s death.”[%p]
Ever since I returned to this worldline, I’ve avoided all news of Kurisu’s murder.[%p]
I was afraid of setting that “result” in stone.[%p]
So I still don’t know who killed Kurisu. I don’t know how or why she died. I don’t know anything at all.[%p]
If I had known it would come to this, would I have looked things up?[%p]
I ask myself that question. The answer is no.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What about attractor field convergence?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That day’s a turning point, remember?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Meaning the probability of Makise Kurisu’s death is roughly 50%.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So convergence won’t happen?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It may happen, it may not. No, it probably will. But I’m sure there’s a loophole somewhere. That loophole is the doorway to Steins Gate.”[%p]
So in the end, it’s a gamble.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, one more thing. Watch out for Doctor Nakabachi.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Remember what I said about World War Three?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It all started because of something called the Nakabachi Paper, a paper Doctor Nakabachi wrote detailing his theory of time travel.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But that fraud’s theory was just a ripoff of John Titor’s.”[%p]
Wait a minute... John Titor’s sitting right in front of me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So what Titor posted on the internet was true?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I mixed in some lies, so not many people listened to me at the time.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I never thought someone would reevaluate it ten years later. Looks like he built his theory off what I wrote. Apparently, it’s almost perfect.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Anyway, Doctor Nakabachi was there when Makise Kurisu was killed, right? So watch out for him. I’m sure he’s important to the divergence of this worldline.”[%p]
Doctor Nakabachi? Important?[%p]
I thought he was just some con artist.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ready to go? Fasten your seatbelt.”[%p]
I look underneath my butt to find what looks like a car seatbelt.[%p]
I wrap it around my waist and fix my body to the seat.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Does it shake a lot?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Shake? No, it doesn’t shake.”[%p]
You mean it does something else?[%p]
Wait, is this safe!?[%p]
Suzuha leans forward and pushes a bright yellow button on the bottom of the panel.[%p]
There are no windows, so I can’t tell if the time machine is moving.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s only three weeks, so it shouldn’t take more than two or three minutes.”[%p]
Suzuha fastens her own seatbelt and sighs.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“When I first leapt to 1975, it was six long hours with nothing to do.”[%p]
I guess time travelers have their own problems.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Since it’s only a few minutes, we won’t bother with the oxygen masks. Just be aware we’ll have no oxygen for the duration.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You mean I have to hold my breath!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Right here...”[%p]
Suzuha points to the center of the cylinder -- the space between me and her.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“There’ll be an air pocket. Stick your head inside, and you’ll have enough oxygen for about ten minutes.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey. For argument’s sake... what happens if we fail to save Kurisu?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“There’s not much fuel left. We barely had enough to begin with. There’s not even enough for a return trip to 2036.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So if we fail to change the worldline, then I’ll be stuck in this time.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But don’t worry. As long as we’re just traveling three weeks each way, we still have enough for two round trips.”[%p]
So what she’s really saying is that we only have two chances.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But then how do you plan to get back to 2036?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I don’t. Once we reach Steins Gate, I won’t have any reason to come to this time in the first place, will I?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Causality will be reconstructed. I should disappear from this time, since I’ll probably be living peacefully in 2036.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But that all depends on you, Uncle Okarin.”[%p]
Her tone is light, but her expression is serious.[%p]
This is the first time in weeks that we’ve spoken, but I just now realized something about her. [%p]
Suzuha is pretty reckless, isn’t she?[%p]
Suddenly, there’s a zapping sound, and countless faint silver lights start floating around the cylinder.[%p]
They look like moth dust. Or powdered snow.[%p]
The lights slowly change colors.[%p]
Violet. Blue. Green. Yellow, orange, and red. Back to silver. Violet. Blue...[%p]
The colors of the rainbow?[%p]
I feel pressure on my entire body, similar to the sensation you feel as you ascend in an elevator.[%p]
In an elevator, you feel as if you’re being pulled downwards. But instead, the time machine feels like it’s pulling at my back.[%p]
The feeling of pressure quickly increases.[%p]
It starts to feel like I’m falling horizontally. I’ve never experienced anything like this. It’s so uncomfortable, I want to scream.[%p]
The strangest thing is that the time machine itself isn’t shaking. In fact, it doesn’t seem to be moving at all.[%p]
There’s no noise. No vibration. It’s eerie.[%p]
The pulling sensation grows even stronger.[%p]
I can hear my bones creaking.[%p]
I imagine my body flattened like a pancake. It’s not a pleasant thought.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Guh...uh...!”[%p]
It’s getting worse![%p]
I look at Suzuha. She has her eyes shut and her jaw clenched tight.[%p]
I can no longer move. It feels like my back is glued to the wall.[%p]
My vision begins to warp.[%p]
And within my warping vision, the powder of light still shifts through the colors of the rainbow.[%p]
It’s strangely beautiful, like something out of a painting.[%p]
And still I keep falling.[%p]
Where is it taking me? Through a tunnel in space-time?[%p]
All I know is that I’m falling.[%p]
Suddenly, everything goes dark.[%p]
I try to scream, but even my voice falls away. It doesn’t even reach my own ears.[%p]
It’s gravity. There’s an intense gravitational distortion behind me.[%p]
And I’m still falling towards it.[%p]
My vision slowly recovers.[%p]
The smell of ozone fills my nostrils.[%p]
Suzuha takes a deep breath and unfastens her seatbelt.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“We’re here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I gulp for air.[%p]
Did I really just travel through time?[%p]
If so, then this is July 28th.[%p]
The day Kurisu and I first met.[%p]
The day I sent the first D-Mail.[%p]
The day it all began.[%p]
Suzuha takes out a digital watch.[%p]
It’s a fairly old-fashioned design.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I bought it in 1975, but it’s not even three years old yet.”[%p]
This is where an uninformed person would say, “In Japanese plz.”[%p]
Suzuha sets the watch to the correct time, then hands it to me.[%p]
The display reads 11:51.[%p]
Nakabachi’s presentation starts at 12.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Let’s do this. You keep an eye on Makise Kurisu and stop whoever tries to kill her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And you?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ll back you up.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Also, remember how I took away your phone? The you of July 28th is here too. Meaning there are currently two Okabe Rintaros in this world.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Whatever you do, don’t let your past self see you. It could cause a major time paradox.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But Titor said that couldn’t happen.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That was a lie. Misinformation.”[%p]
Come to think of it, Alpha Suzuha said the stuff she posted about the many-worlds interpretation was fake too.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Got it.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Then let’s go. We’ll rendezvous at the time machine when it’s over!”[%p]
Suzuha finishes her rushed explanation and motions me toward the hatch.[%p]
I open the hatch and grab the rim.[%p]
I squeeze my way out.[%p]
Suzuha crawls out after me and closes the hatch.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You hide! I’ll provide a distraction.”[%p]
Suzuha runs up to the emergency door.[%p]
And then, to my astonishment, she draws her gun and fires at the doorknob.[%p]
The door opens easily. That must have broken the lock.[%p]
Any minute now, a crowd of people will run up these stairs to see what happened. My past self will be among them.[%p]
I need to hide before they get here![%p]
