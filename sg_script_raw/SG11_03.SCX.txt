That was a close one.[%p]
I nearly bumped into myself on the 8th floor landing.[%p]
Right after I ran downstairs to the 7th floor, I heard footsteps running the other way behind me. Those footsteps were mine, no doubt. It was a near miss.[%p]
To be safe, I descend to the 4th floor before stopping to take a breath.[%p]
I take a look around, but there’s nobody paying attention to me.[%p]
I wonder what Suzuha is doing. I’m worried, but I need to focus on my own mission.[%p]
I must prevent Kurisu’s death.[%p]
In about 30 minutes from now, just after Nakabachi’s presentation ends, someone will murder her.[%p]
I know where it happens. In the 8th floor hallway, towards the back of the building, where people rarely go.[%p]
What I don’t know is who stabbed her.[%p]
Instead of running around and drawing attention to myself, I should just wait at the scene.[%p]
Let’s cool off here for about five minutes, and then head over there.[%p]
If I remember correctly, Kurisu tried to talk to me in the assembly hall, but I blew her off and came down here.[%p]
After that, I tried calling Mayuri, but her phone was off and I couldn’t get through, so I went back up to the assembly hall to find her. [%p]
What time was that?[%p]
I search my memories, trying to plot the actions I took on July 28th. It sounded simple when Suzuha said it, but staying away from my past self is going to take more work than I thought.[%p]
Frustration mounts. I shove Suzuha’s watch into my pocket to quash it.[%p]
Just then--[%p]
[name]???[line]“Excuse me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“!?”[%p]
That voice...[%p]
I turn around.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu...!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Um, do I know you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You came down from the roof just now, didn’t you?”[%p]
She looks at me with those beautiful eyes, eyes shining with intelligence and strength of will.[%p]
I thought I would never see her again.[%p]
But now.[%p]
Now, before my very eyes, is the girl I love.[%p]
Tears well up in my eyes.[%p]
I want to embrace her right this instant.[%p]
It takes everything I have to resist the urge.[%p]
Don’t forget. This is our first meeting.[%p]
This Kurisu doesn’t know me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I heard a strange sound from the roof. Is that why the building shook just now?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What’s going on? It’s not Doctor Nakabachi’s doing, is it?”[%p]
Why did I have to run into Kurisu, of all people?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I can’t answer. I’m afraid that if I speak, I’ll be unable to contain my emotions.[%p]
The memory of her last smile is burned into my mind, imploring me to act.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you listening? You’re sweating like crazy.”[%p]
Kurisu looks at me with suspicion.[%p]
What would happen if I were to grab Kurisu and run? [%p]
Would divergence change? Would her murder be averted?[%p]
I recall all the times Mayuri died. I recall all the times I time leaped to save her.[%p]
Everything I tried ended in vain.[%p]
I was unable to save her even once.[%p]
No matter what I did, the world itself killed her.[%p]
Won’t it be the same with Kurisu?[%p]
Should I even try?[%p]
I reach towards Kurisu, my hand shaking.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey!”[%p]
She steps back in surprise and fear, clutching a manila envelope to her chest.[%p]
This is our first meeting. I know that. But to me, she’s still the girl I love. [%p]
If I’d been thinking straight a second ago, I would have realized that my plan to grab her and flee wasn’t going to work. Kurisu would never follow some strange man she only just met.[%p]
Running isn’t an option.[%p]
All I can do is wait at the scene of the crime.[%p]
Fighting against the urge to stay, I force myself to turn and leave.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Please answer my question!”[%p]
But Kurisu pursues me.[%p]
Why is she so desperate to know who I am?[%p]
I do look suspicious. I’ll admit that.[%p]
But if she thinks I’m dangerous, why would she come alone?[%p]
I turn around reluctantly and meet Kurisu’s stare.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Answer me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can I--”[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]“Can I really save you?”[%e]
The words catch in my throat.[%p]
Can I save her?[%p]
I don’t know.[%p]
All I know is that convergence is merciless and cruel, and that I am powerless to stop it.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Can you... what?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I shake my head, then bolt for the stairs before Kurisu can react.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“W-wait! Stop!”[%p]
When I make it back to the 8th floor, the presentation has already started.[%p]
I peek in through the door of the assembly hall.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who the hell am I!? Someone who knows you for a fraud, that’s who!”[%p]
Someone in the audience is shouting at Doctor Nakabachi.[%p]
And that someone is me.[%p]
Now I remember. I confronted Doctor Nakabachi in the middle of his presentation. I called him a fraud for ripping off John Titor’s posts.[%p]
From this angle, I look like a real asshole.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“S-someone throw that man out!”[%p]
Staff members approach. Damn, this is embarrassing.[%p]
But there’s nothing I can do here. I need to leave before Kurisu appears.[%p]
I turn around and head deeper into the dim passage.[%p]
An image flashes through my mind. She was lying there, at the end of this passage, in a puddle of her own blood.[%p]
Twenty minutes from now, that’s exactly what will happen.[%p]
Can I prevent it?[%p]
...I must. Whatever it takes.[%p]
There’s a pile of junk -- toolboxes, cardboard, and the like -- about halfway down the passage. The perfect hiding spot. I crouch behind them.[%p]
Now all I have to do is wait for Kurisu to show.[%p]
But what will I do when she does?[%p]
Only now do I realize that I’m completely unarmed. I really didn’t think this through.[%p]
Kurisu was lying in a pool of blood. That means her killer had a weapon.[%p]
Since I didn’t hear a gunshot, it must have been a knife, or something similar. How am I going to defend her -- and myself?[%p]
Is there anything around here that might work as a weapon?[%p]
I still have about 20 minutes.[%p]
But one wrong move, and someone might catch me. I shouldn’t leave this spot.[%p]
Maybe I’m being overly cautious, but this is my only chance to prevent Kurisu’s death. I don’t want to jeopardize that.[%p]
I don’t know what I’d do if I ran into Kurisu again. It’s a miracle that I managed to tear myself away last time.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Haah.”[%p]
The longer I wait in the darkness, the harder it becomes. The anticipation is killing me.[%p]
So far, not a single soul has passed down this hallway.[%p]
I can faintly hear Nakabachi’s voice through the mic from far away, but that’s it.[%p]
The silence does nothing but increase my tension.[%p]
To make matters worse, it’s hot and humid. I guess the air conditioner’s not on back here.[%p]
My entire body’s drenched in sweat, and I haven’t even been hiding for a minute.[%p]
Sweat drips from my brow to the floor.[%p]
I rub it out with my shoe.[%p]
I have to keep waiting.[%p]
There’s no other choice.[%p]
I stay there, crouched in the darkness, for what seems an eternity.[%p]
In the distance, I hear the sound of sparse applause.[%p]
I glance at Suzuha’s watch. It’s 12:26.[%p]
I guess the presentation’s over.[%p]
I peek out from behind the boxes, and just then--[%p]
I hear footsteps approaching.[%p]
I quickly duck back behind cover.[%p]
My heart is pounding.[%p]
Someone’s coming this way.[%p]
Who? Is it Kurisu’s murderer?[%p]
I clench my teeth and try to drive away the tension.[%p]
I can only pray that I won’t be found.[%p]
Finally, the footsteps pass right by my hiding spot.[%p]
Moving only my eyes, I sneak a glance at the person.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Kurisu?[%p]
There’s no one with her.[%p]
I didn’t expect Kurisu to be the first to appear.[%p]
What is she doing back here? This area is for employees only.[%p]
Now that I think about it, Kurisu’s murder made no sense.[%p]
Why was she killed in a place she would normally never come?[%p]
Careful to keep quiet, I watch Kurisu from the shadows.[%p]
About five meters down the hall, she stops walking and leans against the wall.[%p]
She’s holding that manila envelope I saw her with earlier. She peeks inside and smiles softly.[%p]
Why is she smiling?[%p]
Kurisu rarely smiles like that.[%p]
I mean, it’s more like her to glare at people.[%p]
That envelope...[%p]
I search my memories again. When Kurisu approached me during Nakabachi’s presentation, I’m pretty sure she was holding that envelope. [%p]
But did she have it when I discovered her body?[%p]
I don’t remember seeing it.[%p]
What could be inside to make Kurisu smile like that?[%p]
I can’t begin to imagine.[%p]
Kurisu hasn’t moved a muscle.[%p]
She’s just standing there, head hung, her face hidden behind her long hair. I can’t read her expression.[%p]
Is she waiting for someone?[%p]
Who?[%p]
Who would she meet in a place like this?[%p]
That’s when I hear another set of footsteps approaching.[%p]
I can’t see who it is from where I’m hiding.[%p]
But given the timing, it has to be the person who killed Kurisu![%p]
And as proof, Kurisu raises her head, and upon recognizing the newcomer, lifts her back off of the wall. Her expression softens slightly.[%p]
The footsteps come even closer.[%p]
Who is it?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I wanted to talk.”[%p]
Kurisu suddenly starts speaking.[%p]
The footsteps pass right by my hiding spot.[%p]
I’m so tense, I can’t move a muscle.[%p]
The newcomer finally appears in my narrow field of vision.[%p]
And it’s...[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!?”[%p]
Doctor Nakabachi![%p]
I slap a hand over my mouth to keep from shouting in astonishment.[%p]
Kurisu and Doctor Nakabachi know each other!?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Oh, one more thing. Watch out for Doctor Nakabachi.”[%p]
Something else occurs to me.[%p]
Why would Kurisu, an accomplished scientist, attend the presentation of a man like Nakabachi?[%p]
He’s just a two-bit inventor. Only fifteen people came to hear him speak, and that’s including trolls like me. There wasn’t even any press coverage.[%p]
Besides, Kurisu hates time travel science.[%p]
That much was obvious from her lecture at ATF.[%p]
In that case, it’s obvious why she’s here.[%p]
She didn’t come to see his presentation.[%p]
She came to see [color index="A0140000"]him[color index="800000"].[%p]
But why?[%p]
What could be the connection?[%p]
...Wait.[%p]
It can’t be...[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you listening, Papa?”[%p]
Papa...[%p]
He’s her [color index="A0140000"]father[color index="800000"]... her estranged father, who she told me she hadn’t seen in seven years.[%p]
Kurisu did say that her father was a physicist.[%p]
And Nakabachi certainly is a physicist, though the scientific community at large has rejected his research.[%p]
But wait... does this mean that Nakabachi killed his own daughter?[%p]
Or was it someone else, someone who has yet to appear?[%p]
There’s no way to know.[%p]
If I could be sure that Nakabachi was the killer, then I would intervene right now.[%p]
But I’m not. I’d better keep watching, see what happens.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“What is that?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I heard you were giving a presentation on time travel.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So I thought about it too. Could it be possible to make a time machine?”[%p]
Kurisu wrote a paper on time travel!?[%p]
But when she spoke at ATF, she rejected the very idea of time travel![%p]
Although, come to think of it, she was awfully interested in the PhoneWave...[%p]
...Damn, I forgot how much of a tsundere she was.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’d like your opinion, Papa.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We can polish it together, then submit it to the scientific community.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t know if they’ll listen, but just in case, I do have acquaintances at Science Magazine.”[%p]
Nakabachi takes out the document and starts reading it with a disgusted frown.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“...”[%p]
So that’s what it was.[%p]
She didn’t have anything dangerous in that envelope, like drugs or a gun. It was just some document.[%p]
But that raises a new question.[%p]
Could that be the Nakabachi Paper?[%p]
According to Suzuha, that document sparked a time travel arms race that ultimately led to World War Three and the deaths of 5.7 billion people.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It started with a race between the EU and Russia. Then America got involved, and things really went to hell.”[%p]
Is that why Kurisu’s safety is so important to changing divergence?[%p]
I get it now.[%p]
Nothing is coincidence. Everything is inevitable.[%p]
Nakabachi flips restlessly through the document.[%p]
He’s not even trying to hide his irritation.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Did I ask you to write this?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well... no, but...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You invited me to come, remember? It was the first time we’d talked in seven years. That’s what got me thinking.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And as I worked on the thesis, I started to realize it might actually be possible to build a time machine. ”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If the thesis is published, you could have your revenge on the scientific community for shunning you--”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“I wasn’t shunned!”[%p]
Nakabachi suddenly shrieks at Kurisu, causing her to shrink back in fear.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Those incompetent bastards were just jealous of my superiority. I was the one who gave up on them!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Please don’t yell...”[%p]
Nakabachi gives his daughter a disdainful snort, then goes back to flipping through the paper.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You read really fast, Papa. Just like I remember.”[%p]
Nakabachi even ignores Kurisu’s words of endearment.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“...Not bad.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You think so?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We can submit it jointly, if you like. I don’t mind.”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“No, don’t do anything. I’ll take care of it.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“What do I mean? I mean don’t think you’re special just because you got your plebeian thesis published in some magazine!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“What? Is that how you look at your father!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m sorry...”[%p]
An awkward silence follows.[%p]
I feel no warmth between these two.[%p]
The only thing I feel is distance.[%p]
Kurisu, in particular, seems desperate to avoid upsetting her father.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Um... we haven’t seen each other in a while. There’s a lot I want to talk about. You’re living in Aomori now, right?”[%p]
Kurisu is trying to maintain a cheerful tone, but I can see that her expression is stiff.[%p]
I remember how she said she had trouble dealing with her father.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I think... my father hates me.”[%p]
She looked so lonely when she spoke those words.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Leave.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh...”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Go back to America. Never show your face to me again!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But--”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“You want my [color index="A0140000"]opinion[color index="800000"]!? We’ll submit it [color index="A0140000"]jointly[color index="800000"]!? You don’t mean any of that! I know how you think!”[%p]
He sounds like a child with an inferiority complex.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Is this pity!? How dare you!? You’re supposed to be my daughter!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I... I don’t understand. Please calm--”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“I am calm! Don’t tell me what to do!”[%p]
This is bad.[%p]
It’s almost time for Kurisu’s murder.[%p]
Was it really Nakabachi, her own father, who killed her?[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“I’ll tell you why I called you here today. I wanted to show you my research, research beyond even what you can imagine!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“I wanted to prove, once and for all, that you are nothing compared to me!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“But that brat in the lab coat ruined everything! I know you were laughing at me too, don’t you deny it! How dare you treat your own father this way!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I wasn’t--”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“You want my [color index="A0140000"]opinion[color index="800000"] on this thesis? Fine, I’ll give it to you.”[%p]
Nakabachi rolls right over Kurisu’s objections. It’s like he doesn’t even hear her voice.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“I’m going to publish it myself. End of discussion.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re... stealing it, Papa?”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“...What did you say?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re stealing my work? I didn’t think even you would do something like--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ah!”[%p]
Nakabachi suddenly whirls and strikes Kurisu across the face.[%p]
What do I do!?[%p]
I know I should do something, but what!?[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Who do you think you’re talking to!?”[%p]
Nakabachi throws the paper aside and seizes his daughter by the throat.[%p]
Kurisu gasps for air. Her face twists in pain as his grip tightens.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ah, guh...”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“You can’t possibly understand how I feel! Why did you have to be so talented!? I detest you! I hate your very existence!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Nobody is allowed to be better than me! Understand!? Nobody! Especially not my own daughter!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“That’s why I sent you away! I couldn’t bear the shame of being your father!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“It’s all your fault! It’s all your fault!”[%p]
This is completely absurd! He’s blaming her for his own failures![%p]
I’ve seen enough. He’s the killer for sure.[%p]
I burst from my hiding spot.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stop!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“...!?”[%p]
I ram him with my shoulder as hard as I can, knocking him away from Kurisu.[%p]
Kurisu gasps for breath.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Guh, gah hoh gah hoh gah hoh...”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Who the hell are you!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I won’t let you kill Kurisu!”[%p]
I’m going to save Kurisu.[%p]
I’m going to save her and change the future.[%p]
Even a weakling like me can pin down an old man like Nakabachi.[%p]
Then I can get Suzuha to call the police and--[%p]
The memory of Kurisu’s body flashes through my mind.[%p]
No! It won’t turn out like that![%p]
Steadying himself with one hand against the wall, Nakabachi gets to his feet and looks straight at me. [%p]
The instant our eyes meet, his face twists in rage.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“You!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“You’re the brat who ruined my presentation!”[%p]
His presentation?[%p]
Right, of course. I called him out on his lies in the middle of his presentation. Nakabachi is mistaking me for my past self -- understandable, since we look exactly the same.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“How dare you show your face before me!? Why does everyone get in my way!?”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“I know! You and Kurisu planned this, didn’t you? Didn’t you!?”[%p]
He’s delusional![%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“You brats won’t get away with this!”[%p]
Nakabachi glares at me with bloodshot eyes, then takes something out of his pocket.[%p]
At first, I can’t tell what it is.[%p]
But then I see it glint in the dim light.[%p]
A knife.[%p]
The blade is about 20 centimeters long.[%p]
I can’t help but shiver at its cold shine.[%p]
Why is he even carrying something like that? Is he completely insane!?[%p]
Wait. Is that the weapon that killed Kurisu?[%p]
I won’t let that happen![%p]
Damn![%p]
Why is my brain so fixated on that scene!?[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“You’ll pay for mocking me!”[%p]
Nakabachi charges like an enraged bull, with no sign of hesitation whatsoever.[%p]
He raises his knife high--[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Kuh!”[%p]
I instinctively dodge back. The knife misses me by a hair.[%p]
He gathers himself for another strike. The sight of his face twisted in madness and rage fills me with terror. I want to scream.[%p]
He’s going to kill me![%p]
No, don’t be afraid![%p]
I can’t die here. The past is already decided![%p]
But wait. If the past is already decided, then doesn’t that mean I can’t save Kurisu? [%p]
I shake off the thought.[%p]
Just think about saving her![%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Apologize!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gh--”[%p]
Swallowing my fear, I force myself to stop running away.[%p]
Instead, I lunge forward.[%p]
I knock Nakabachi’s hand aside.[%p]
The knife falls from his grip and clatters to the floor. I leap on it and pick it up.[%p]
That was easier than I expected.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Stop it, Papa!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Don’t tell me what to do!”[%p]
I look up in surprise.[%p]
Nakabachi has taken a screwdriver from a toolbox left in the passage.[%p]
Kurisu is walking towards him, pleading with him to stop. She’s completely defenseless.[%p]
No, Kurisu! Stay away from him! You’re the one in danger, not me![%p]
Just when I thought I’d disarmed him, he finds something else![%p]
Even a screwdriver can kill with enough force behind it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Run, Kurisu!”[%p]
Kurisu glances at me, but she doesn’t move.[%p]
Why won’t she run away!?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This is crazy, Papa! Please stop!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“What do you know? What do you know!?”[%p]
Nakabachi has completely lost his mind.[%p]
Nothing she can say will reach him.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“If only you’d never been born!”[%p]
Nakabachi turns to Kurisu, brandishing his screwdriver.[%p]
But Kurisu still doesn’t run away.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Guh...!”[%p]
Blood spurts from the arm Kurisu used to guard her face.[%p]
She’s going to die. I have to do something![%p]
I grip the knife firmly in my hands.[%p]
Kurisu won’t die if I kill Nakabachi first.[%p]
That image again![%p]
Stop getting in my way![%p]
I won’t be tied to that past![%p]
I need to do this. To change the future. To save Kurisu![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“NAKABACHI!”[%p]
As Nakabachi raises his arm for another blow, I thrust my knife at his unprotected back.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“NO!”[%p]
Through the knife, my hand feels resistance.[%p]
The sensation of tearing through flesh, scraping bone.[%p]
It’s surprisingly tough.[%p]
But at the same time, I feel the flesh pulsating.[%p]
It shifts in time with my victim’s breath.[%p]
I--[%p]
Stabbed--[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ah... guh...!”[%p]
I stabbed--[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“wh...y...”[%p]
I can’t believe my eyes.[%p]
What happened?[%p]
I tried to stab Nakabachi.[%p]
The blade should have pierced his back.[%p]
And yet--[%p]
At the last minute, Kurisu forced herself between us, as if... as if to protect Nakabachi.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why...”[%p]
Strength drains from Kurisu’s body. She slumps against me, her head on my shoulder.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Ha... hahahaha! A fitting end for you fools, hahahaha!”[%p]
Laughing maniacally, Nakabachi picks up the dropped thesis and runs to the elevator at the far end of the hall.[%p]
I can’t chase him.[%p]
I know what’s going to happen if I don’t stop him, but I can’t take a single step.[%p]
Is this the joke? Is [color index="A0140000"]this[color index="800000"] the punchline?[%p]
I wanted to know who killed Kurisu.[%p]
And now...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m... sorry...”[%p]
Kurisu speaks. Her voice is barely a whisper.[%p]
I feel something wet on my hands.[%p]
Wet... and warm.[%p]
Blood.[%p]
Kurisu’s blood.[%p]
Gushing from her wound.[%p]
It’s warm, but not hot.[%p]
And yet, it feels like it’s burning my hands.[%p]
I try to pull the knife out.[%p]
If I can stop the bleeding, maybe she’ll be okay.[%p]
But my hands won’t move.[%p]
It’s like they’ve turned to stone.[%p]
My arms. My fingers.[%p]
No matter how hard I try, they won’t move an inch.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Haah... haah...”[%p]
Kurisu’s breathing quickly grows labored.[%p]
She’s suffering.[%p]
I didn’t mean for this to happen.[%p]
This isn’t what I wanted![%p]
Why won’t my hands move?[%p]
I want to pull out the knife. I want to ease her pain. Why won’t my body obey me!?[%p]
It’s as if someone else is in control.[%p]
Kurisu’s body convulses against mine. The pain must be unbearable.[%p]
Is there nothing I can do to help her!?[%p]
I want to cry.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why...”[%p]
The only thing I can do... is ask.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Because... he’s still... my father.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I just... wanted him... to accept me...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I studied... so hard... hoping he would... praise me...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But now... I finally... understand...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Papa... didn’t want... to accept me...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m such... an idiot...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why... did I save him... I wonder...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m... sorry... for getting you... involved...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ugh... it hurts...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Am I... going to die?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t want to die...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t want it... to end... like this...”[%p]
Her voice is fading fast.[%p]
Don’t die. Please don’t die on me![%p]
But my prayers are in vain.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Help... me...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“He...lp...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
Her body suddenly grows heavy. I can no longer hear the sound of her breathing.[%p]
And yet, the blood from her wound is still warm.[%p]
I killed her.[%p]
I killed her.[%p]
The one who killed Kurisu...[%p]
Was me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah... ah...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“AHHHHHHHHHHH!”[%p]
As I scream, another me looks down from above.[%p]
As he hears the sound of my despair, the last piece of the puzzle clicks into place.[%p]
The scream I heard that day... was my own.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle Okarin!”[%p]
Someone pulls at my arm.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Come on! Get up!”[%p]
I feel hands slip under my shoulders and drag me away.[%p]
The knife in my hands pulls free of Kurisu’s chest.[%p]
A fresh torrent of blood follows it.[%p]
Still warm.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Open your eyes, Kurisu... Wake up...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Pull yourself together!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“We need to get out of here before they find us!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m sorry... I didn’t mean to kill you... I tried to save you... I did...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why is this happening...”[%p]
Someone puts my arm over their shoulder and hauls me to my feet, then drags me away step by step.[%p]
I don’t have the strength to resist. Guilt and regret are the only things inside of me.[%p]
I killed Kurisu... twice.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hup!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Phew... let’s get outta here...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Don’t give up yet, Uncle.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Everything’s gonna be fine. I promise!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Now hold on tight!”[%p]
I feel someone push me hard from behind.[%p]
Next, they take the knife away. My fingers are like solid rock. They have to be pried open one by one.[%p]
I failed to save Kurisu.[%p]
Worse... convergence made me kill her.[%p]
The past has already been decided.[%p]
It was impossible to change it from the start.[%p]
