Someone drags me out of the time machine.[%p]
I crumple on the spot, powerless to even stand.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Woah, you’re already back! It hasn’t even been a minute.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
Mayuri rushes over to me.[%p]
She looks at my face in concern.[%p]
But even her concern is too much for me to bear.[%p]
Please, don’t talk to me.[%p]
Just leave me alone.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whoa, you’re covered in blood! What happened!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Get him a towel, Dad! And water! And some clothes, too! Hurry!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Eh? Eh? An explanation, por favor!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Just go already!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“O-okay!”[%p]
Daru runs back inside the building.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Are you okay? Hang in there... don’t die...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“He’s okay. It’s not his blood.”[%p]
Leave me alone.[%p]
I don’t deserve your concern.[%p]
Save Kurisu? What a joke.[%p]
Not only did I fail to save her. I took her life with my own two hands.[%p]
Three weeks ago, in this very spot.[%p]
I killed her.[%p]
I murdered her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s no way to save her... there never was...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hahaha... Everything has already been decided...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s the same as it was with Mayuri. The same...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No matter how hard I struggle... the result will always be the same...”[%p]
We have a time machine. Shouldn’t we give it another try?[%p]
No. It’s not that simple.[%p]
No matter how many times I try, the result will converge on Kurisu’s death.[%p]
Even if I throw the knife away, fate will find some other way to kill Kurisu.[%p]
Maybe Nakabachi will kill her.[%p]
Maybe I’ll trip and push her down the stairs.[%p]
Maybe she’ll just drop dead for no reason.[%p]
The cause doesn’t matter.[%p]
The effect will always be the same.[%p]
It doesn’t matter if I time leap, or if I time travel. Going to the past can’t change the result.[%p]
Maybe a D-Mail could shift divergence enough to take us to another attractor field, but there’s no way to control what might happen.[%p]
D-Mail is a shot in the dark. It’s useless.[%p]
Useless. Everything is useless.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s nothing I can do... nothing... nothing...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t save Kurisu after all... ha, haha, hahaha...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I knew this would happen... I knew it would turn out like this...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t take this any more... I’m so tired... enough already... I give up...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Haha, ha...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
A burning numbness spreads through my cheek.[%p]
Mayuri hit me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...”[%p]
She’s never done anything like this before.[%p]
The shock is enough to bring me to my senses.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
Mayuri looks at me with tears streaming down her cheeks.[%p]
Her small body gently embraces mine, though I’m still covered in Kurisu’s blood.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin... you’re not a quitter.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii knows. You never, ever give up. Not until the very end.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Remember? Every day, Mayushii prayed for help in front of Granny’s grave.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And every day, you came to see me.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Even on rainy days and snowy days, you always stood next to Mayushii and called my name.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Because you were always there for Mayushii... I was finally able to say goodbye to Granny.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii doesn’t really understand what’s going on, but don’t give up now. Okay?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii doesn’t want to see you sad.”[%p]
Mayuri’s gentle warmth envelops me.[%p]
I cling to that warmth, but it’s not enough to heal my heart.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But... I killed her.”[%p]
The person most precious to me, who I wanted so desperately to save.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I... killed her!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin...”[%p]
I can still feel the knife in my hand.[%p]
I can still feel her fading heartbeat.[%p]
I look at my hands over Mayuri’s shoulder.[%p]
They’re red with blood. Kurisu’s blood.[%p]
The shaking won’t stop.[%p]
Tears fall, washing away the blood.[%p]
Guilt and despair are tearing my soul.[%p]
If Suzuha hadn’t taken the knife, I might have slit my own throat in that very spot.[%p]
This reality is too much to bear.[%p]
But I realize that this is retribution, my just punishment for taking the godlike power of time travel and using it to distort the past.[%p]
Kurisu can’t be saved.[%p]
That has been proven beyond a doubt.[%p]
At the very least, [color index="A0140000"]I[color index="800000"] can’t save her.[%p]
Not even with Mayuri’s encouragement.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s nothing I can do...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’re wrong.”[%p]
Suzuha speaks, her voice full of conviction. And immediately afterwards--[%p]
I hear a familiar melody. My mail tone.[%p]
Mayuri takes my phone out of her pocket. She’s been looking after it.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’ve got mail, Okarin...”[%p]
Mayuri gently puts my phone into my hand.[%p]
I don’t have the energy to check my mail. But for some reason, Suzuha gestures for me to look at it.[%p]
I reluctantly open my inbox.[%p]
What?[%p]
Turn on the TV?[%p]
That’s all it says.[%p]
The sender is unfamiliar.[%p]
Is this a prank? Spam?[%p]
I’m bewildered. I don’t know who sent this.[%p]
But then I happen to glance at the send time, and the shock is like a lightning bolt to the brain.[%p]
The date it was sent...[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]August 21, 2025.[%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“2025...”[%p]
No... Is this...[%p]
It doesn’t even occur to me to wonder if my phone has malfunctioned.[%p]
After all, I [color index="A0140000"]know[color index="800000"] this phenomenon.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A D-Mail!?”[%p]
I look up at Suzuha.[%p]
She sees my confusion and looks at my phone.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It actually came through! Just like he said it would!”[%p]
Judging by her surprise, I guess she doesn’t know much.[%p]
Suzuha leapt from 2036. That’s 11 years after this D-Mail was sent.[%p]
Does that mean it’s not related to her?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What does it mean?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“There must be something on. Something you need to see!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hey, guys! I brought the stuff!”[%p]
Daru comes back with a convenience store bag. Right on time.[%p]
Fortunately, my phone has TV reception.[%p]
As soon as I switch it on, I see a news reporter standing in some foreign airport.[%p]
There’s a jumbo jet in the background. Looking closer, I see burns near the plane’s tail.[%p]
The caption says “Fire on Russian Airlines.”[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]“Russian authorities announced today that a fire broke out on Russian Airlines Flight 801, en route from Narita to Moscow.”[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]“The flight departed Narita Airport at 11:05 Japan time, but a fire broke out in the cargo hold shortly before arrival.”[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]“The flight made an emergency landing at Domodedovo International Airport, where the passengers were evacuated. No one was injured.”[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]“One of the passengers on Flight 801 was a Japanese physicist who had declared his intention to seek asylum in Russia.”[%p]
The screen changes, and the camera cuts to what appears to be the airport lobby. A man is standing there, surrounded by reporters.[%p]
When I see his face, my breath catches in my throat.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Doctor Nakabachi!”[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]“Doctor Nakabachi, real name Makise Shouichi, made these comments to the press earlier today.”[%p]
I still haven’t recovered from the shock of murdering Kurisu. The images on the TV seem like something from a dream.[%p]
Did they say Nakabachi sought asylum in Russia?[%p]
I didn’t think people still did that in this day and age. I mean, all you need is a passport to travel to Russia.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“I am delighted to have arrived safely in this wonderful country. My deepest gratitude to the Russian government for accepting me.”[%p]
“What happened on the plane?” read the subtitles at the bottom of the screen.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“When the cabin filled with smoke, I remained perfectly calm. Some passengers panicked, but they settled down after I gave them a talking to.”[%p]
Nakabachi responds confidently.[%p]
He certainly doesn’t look like a man who could strangle his own daughter.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“My compliments to the pilot for his safe landing. He’s a hero, for he saved not only my life, but my historic thesis as well.”[%p]
The subtitles change to “Is that thesis related to your request for asylum?”[%p]
Nakabachi nods theatrically.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Indeed. If this thesis had been lost, it would have set scientific progress back a century.”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“This thesis will change the course of human history!”[%p]
“What is your thesis about?”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“This thesis describes the first practical theory of time travel! Do you understand!? Time travel! I, Doctor Nakabachi, have succeeded where countless others have failed!”[%p]
Nakabachi’s tone quickly grows feverish.[%p]
Now he’s talking directly to the camera.[%p]
Moreover, he’s not talking about the accident at all. He’s just promoting his research.[%p]
He presents something to the camera.[%p]
It’s the envelope. The one Kurisu gave him.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“This envelope contains the future of mankind! Soon, all of our dreams shall be realized! When I present this thesis to the scientific community, the world will change forever, and I will be known as the father of the time machine!”[%p]
I have no right to condemn Nakabachi for his actions, not when it was my hand that took Kurisu’s life.[%p]
But at the same time, I can’t stop myself from recalling the words Kurisu spoke, that hurt, betrayed tone that triggered Nakabachi’s violence.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re stealing my work? I didn’t think even you would do something like--”[%p]
Do those words not echo in his ears too? How can he stand there and present his murdered daughter’s work as if it were his own, and look so proud of himself while doing it?[%p]
I hear my teeth grinding in my head.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Originally, this envelope was in my checked baggage. If it had stayed there, then it would have burned up in the cargo hold, and humanity’s dreams along with it.”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“However! Fate intervened on my behalf, as if God himself had decreed that my greatness should be known across the world!”[%p]
Nakabachi thrusts his open hand at the camera.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Behold the vessel of God’s grace! Because [color index="A0140000"]this[color index="800000"] was inside the envelope, it set off the metal detector.”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“As a result, I had to take the envelope with me on the plane!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“The pilot is a hero, yes. But the true hero, the savior of humanity’s future, is this tiny figurine!”[%p]
Sitting in the palm of his hand is a lump of silvery metal barely five centimeters tall.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“AHHH!”[%p]
Mayuri points at the screen.[%p]
I look closer.[%p]
That lump of metal in Nakabachi’s hand.[%p]
It’s not just [color index="A0140000"]any[color index="800000"] lump of metal.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s my Metal Upa! Look! See there? It has Mayushii’s name on it!”[%p]
Upa is a mascot character from the popular card game RaiNet Access Battlers.[%p]
You can see Upa merchandise everywhere in Akihabara, from capsule toys to phone straps and other accessories.[%p]
But of all Upa merchandise, the most rare is the Metal Upa.[%p]
The very same Metal Upa that Nakabachi is presenting to the camera.[%p]
Near the bottom of the Metal Upa, I can see cute letters written in bright red magic marker.[%p]
The letters read...[%p]
“Mayushii’s!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whoa, you’re right! What’s he doing with it?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I dropped it during the presentation! I looked everywhere, but couldn’t find it. So that’s where it went!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I can’t get it back if it’s all the way in Russia...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I stare at the screen in disbelief.[%p]
My body is shaking. Goosebumps break out over every inch of flesh.[%p]
I know what this is.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The Butterfly Effect!”[%p]
Three weeks ago, Mayuri dropped her Metal Upa in the assembly hall of Radi-Kan. That tiny figure, a mere child’s toy, went on to decide the fate of mankind.[%p]
It rescued the Nakabachi Paper from the fire.[%p]
And in so doing, it laid the foundation for World War Three.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha... did you know about this?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha answers with a look of apology.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who sent that D-Mail from 2025?”[%p]
Whoever it was clearly meant for us to see the news about Doctor Nakabachi.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Sorry.”[%p]
Sorry? About what?[%p]
What is she apologizing for?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Sorry for not telling you everything.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But we needed you to fail once. You had to experience Makise Kurisu’s death firsthand.”[%p]
What?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You... tricked me?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Not exactly. It was part of the plan. At least, that’s what I was told.”[%p]
Told? By whom?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m sorry for making you go through that, Uncle.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Tell me what’s going on.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“See for yourself.”[%p]
Suzuha points to the phone in my hand.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Then you’ll understand.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you talking about?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The message should already be in your phone.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The message you sent from 2025.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“A video mail.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You received one, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah...!”[%p]
She’s right.[%p]
When was that again?[%p]
July 28th. Right after I met Kurisu for the first time.[%p]
Just as I was about to contact Mayuri, I received a mysterious video mail from an address I had never seen before.[%p]
Is that what she’s talking about?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But there was nothing on it. Just noise.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Try again.”[%p]
Suzuha grins.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If you try now, after failing once to save Makise Kurisu’s life...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You should be able to see it.”[%p]
Are you kidding me?[%p]
Is that even possible?[%p]
