I’m not convinced, but I check my phone anyway, just to be sure.[%p]
And there, I find a saved video mail.[%p]
When I check the sender’s address, I realize that it’s from the same address as the D-Mail just now.[%p]
So they’re from the same person. And this person... is me in fifteen years?[%p]
Fifteen years. 2025. The year I die, according to Suzuha.[%p]
I sent this message on the eve of my death, a message to myself in 2010.[%p]
Suzuha said that there was a plan to reach Steins Gate.[%p]
Could that plan be in this video?[%p]
Mayuri and Daru peek over my shoulder.[%p]
I take a deep breath...[%p]
And press play with a trembling finger.[%p]
Nothing appears on the screen but noise.[%p]
Nothing has changed after all.[%p]
There’s no hidden message or anyth--[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!?”[%p]
The noise suddenly dissolves, revealing the silhouette of a man.[%p]
It looks like the video was shot somewhere dark. I can’t see the man’s face.[%p]
Unkempt hair. A lab coat. That’s all I can make out.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Is that you in fifteen years?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It has to be! Something about him just says ’Okarin.’”[%p]
Really?[%p]
Is this guy really me?[%p]
My phone’s tiny screen has become a window onto the future.[%p]
I can’t believe I’m about to hear a message from myself.[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Did you get my email? Then go watch the news. If you already have, then keep listening.”[%p]
So that last mail was from him. From me.[%p]
It doesn’t feel real.[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Greetings. It’s been fifteen years, I suppose you could say.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow, your voice is so deep and cool!”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“The year is 2025. I’m sending this video by a process similar to D-Mail.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You dismantled the PhoneWave. So did I. But not one year later, I -- which is to say you -- turned back to time travel as my last hope.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“I’ve spent fourteen years researching time travel.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Along the way, I managed to design a D-Mail transmitter that wasn’t bound by the 36-byte limit.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“The fact that you’re watching this means that you failed to save Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“It hurts, doesn’t it? I know how you feel. After all, I went through it myself fifteen years ago.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“That’s right. I failed too.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“I’ve lived with that failure for fifteen years.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Do you understand why you had to fail?”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“It was necessary. Necessary to give me the proper [color index="A0140000"]motivation[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You failed to save Kurisu. You killed her with your own two hands.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Your guilt, your self-loathing, have driven me for fifteen years. They gave me the [color index="A0140000"]focus[color index="800000"] I needed to complete my plan.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Without your failure, you would not be watching this message now.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“As you know, this worldline is subject to attractor field convergence.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Time travel alone cannot save Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]”That is why you had to fail. To create the chain of causality that linked you to me.” [%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Because you failed, I spent the last fifteen years researching time travel.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“As the revelations Nakabachi unleashed sped the world towards nuclear war, I continued my research in secret.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Suzuha’s time machine is the result. Although the finishing touches were Daru’s and mine, its design was based on the theory that SERN first developed...”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“...and that Kurisu improved on the worldline you undid.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Its model number is C204. C for Christina. I believe you understand what that signifies.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]”Now that the causal link has been established, allow me to explain the final stage of the plan.” [%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“The purpose of this plan is to change divergence and reach the unknown worldline called Steins Gate.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“By the way, I’m the one who named it Steins Gate. You, of all people, know why I chose that name.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Because it sounds cool. Isn’t that right?”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“There are two conditions you must meet to reach Steins Gate.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“First, you must save Makise Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Second, you must destroy the Nakabachi Paper.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“I know what you’re thinking. Convergence won’t let you change the past. No matter what you do, Kurisu will die.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“But rest assured, there is a way.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You can save Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Listen carefully.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“On July 28th, the first you went to Nakabachi’s presentation blissfully unaware of what was about to happen.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You must not change what the first you saw.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Those events have been established. They are the result upon which this worldline converges.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“However.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“There is room for deception.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You don’t understand, I know. Calm down. I’ll explain.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You’re going to deceive [color index="A0140000"]yourself[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“The first you saw Kurisu lying in a pool of blood.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“If you were to change that fact, it would render everything that you have done since -- as well as everything that I have done -- a paradox.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“After finding Kurisu’s body, you sent a D-Mail, which was intercepted by Echelon, which tipped off SERN.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Recall your experiences on the Alpha worldline.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You saw more than just Mayuri’s death.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You saw Kurisu alive and well. You made her a lab member despite her protests, and together, you built the Time Leap Machine.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“It was only three weeks, but she was [color index="A0140000"]there[color index="800000"], beside you.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Those memories are yours. Those memories are mine. They are the proof that we did not live only on this worldline, where Kurisu died on July 28th.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You traveled to the Alpha worldline.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You met Kurisu and fell in love.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You sacrificed the dreams of those closest to you.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“But still, you fought to give Mayuri a future.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“For three weeks, you fought. And now, those memories are part of you.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“If you had not seen Kurisu’s body in the hallway of Radi-Kan...”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You would not have sent that first D-Mail. SERN would not have found you.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“When you encountered Kurisu later, you would not have been shocked to see her alive.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You would not have spoken the words that led her to your doorstep.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Without those memories...”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You would not now be willing to travel through time to save her.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“I would not have spent my life searching for a path to Steins Gate.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“I would not have recorded this message.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Daru and I would not have completed the time machine.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Suzuha would not be standing beside you now.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You must not reject the three weeks you spent drifting between worldlines.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You must not undo the past!”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]”Those three weeks made you who you are, a man who would do [color index="A0140000"]anything[color index="800000"] to save the woman he loves.” [%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Your desperation made me who I am, a man who has given [color index="A0140000"]everything[color index="800000"] to make that dream come true.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“This moment would not be possible if not for the memories that you and I share!”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“The man you were trying to create, a man with none of those memories to drive him, could never stand where you stand now.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“It [color index="A0140000"]all[color index="800000"] meant something.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“My preparations are complete. The rest is up to you.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“The final phase of Operation [color index="820000"]Skuld[color index="800000"] will now commence.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Your mission: change the outcome without changing established events.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You saw Makise Kurisu lying in a pool of blood. That has been established.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“But at the same time, [color index="A0140000"]only[color index="800000"] that has been established.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Deceive yourself.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Deceive the world.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“That is the choice which will lead you to Steins Gate.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Good luck, mad scientist.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“El.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Psy.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“Kongroo.”[%p]
And with that, the video ends.[%p]
Mayuri and Daru look dumbfounded. They obviously didn’t understand a single word.[%p]
I, however...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh... heh heh heh...”[%p]
Laughter bubbles up from the depths of my soul.[%p]
Not minutes ago, I was lost in despair.[%p]
I was ready to kill myself for what I had done.[%p]
But now... I’m laughing.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh, hehehehe...”[%p]
Operation Skuld?[%p]
El Psy Kongroo?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m thirty-three years old and I [color index="A0140000"]still[color index="800000"] have no shame?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Deceive myself? Deceive the world?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s such chuuni bullshit!”[%p]
It’s pathetic. Laughable. A juvenile fantasy.[%p]
But at the same time... it feels [color index="A0140000"]right[color index="800000"].[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Very well! If this is the choice of Steins Gate, then so be it!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma! Deceiving the world is child’s play!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It looks like I have to change the world after all!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“MUHAHAHAHA!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whoa! I thought Okarin was finally turning serious, but now he’s back to his usual antics.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But you know, Mayushii likes Okarin better this way♪”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Yeah, I know what you mean. Okarin just isn’t Okarin unless he’s laughing like an idiot.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hououin Kyouma saved Mayushii, you know.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So this time, he’ll definitely save Makise Kurisu!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“But ’deceive the world’? What’s that supposed to mean?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ummm... Mayushii doesn’t have a clue...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh... Isn’t it obvious?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The only established fact about the past is that I saw Kurisu lying in a pool of blood. That’s the extent of my observation.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu was lying in a pool of blood. As for whether she was alive or dead...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s still open to interpretation.”[%p]
Isn’t that right, future me?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Mayuri tilts her head. She still doesn’t get it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“For example, just think of it like this.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu was merely unconscious, and the blood was just a coat of red paint.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh! Is that what happened?”[%p]
Mayuri’s eyes open wide in wonder.[%p]
I give up. She’s not going to understand.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Wait a second. The news reports all said that she was--”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What’s true now doesn’t matter. Only what Uncle Okarin saw on July 28th matters.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“R-really?”[%p]
Really. And that’s because I’m not the Okabe Rintaro who lived on the Beta worldline after Kurisu died.[%p]
I traveled to the Alpha worldline and back.[%p]
I am not bound by whatever effect Kurisu’s death may have had during that time.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What I’m going to do is recreate what I saw, and only what I saw. But this time, I’ll do it so Kurisu doesn’t have to die.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Don’t forget you also need to destroy the Nakabachi Paper. Can you handle it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who do you think you’re talking to, Part-Time Warrior?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Part-time warrior?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you forgotten? I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!”[%p]
I disregard the blank stares of my comrades and brush back my hair with a flourish.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“My plan is flawless. Operation Skuld will succeed!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I need to prepare. Give me 30 minutes.”[%p]
Suzuha tightens her expression and nods firmly.[%p]
