I squat against the roof’s chain fence with my eyes closed.[%p]
To refresh my memory, I pull out the drawers of my mental archive and sort through each file one by one.[%p]
My actions that day. Mayuri’s actions. My conversation with Kurisu. Nakabachi’s presentation.[%p]
With those memories to guide me, I begin to draw up a plan for how to complete my mission.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin! I got the stuff!”[%p]
I open my eyes once I hear Mayuri’s voice.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then it’s time.”[%p]
I take a deep breath and stand up.[%p]
Mayuri’s faster on her feet than Daru and I are, so I had her pick up some things for me.[%p]
She went all the way to the lab and back in the sweltering heat, but she’s not even breathing hard.[%p]
She runs up to me with a triumphant smile.[%p]
Almost like a playful puppy, shaking her tail.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Here you go. Will this work?”[%p]
In her hand is a plastic stick, about 30 cm long.[%p]
I take it and nod in satisfaction.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Good work, Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe! Mayushii’s happy to be useful to Okarin♪”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh! I also brought you this.”[%p]
She hands me a banana.[%p]
I guess she’s telling me not to time travel on an empty stomach.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What’s that?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“A banana!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“No, I mean that stick.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not a stick. It’s a sword.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“One of our lab’s many inventions -- Future Gadget No. 6: The Cyalume Saber!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Cyalume Saber?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s a red cyalume glow stick. An essential item for idol and voice actress concerts.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But it’s not just a glow stick. It’s saber shaped, just as its name implies, so you can reenact scenes from Spark Wars.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Um... wow?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Furthermore, it can also form fake blood clots. Detach the cap at the tip, and thick ’blood’ starts flowing out.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I, uh, really don’t get what you were trying to accomplish when you made this...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“We wanted to make our sword fights more realistic.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What he means to say is that everything is inevitable.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I think I see the plan. You’re gonna use that cyalume stuff as a stand-in for Makise Kurisu’s blood, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Precisely.”[%p]
I stuff my cheeks with banana, enraptured by my own genius.[%p]
I truly am a mad scientist! Muhahaha![%p]
I put the Cyalume Saber into my pocket. It’s about 30 cm long, so it sticks out a little, but I don’t mind.[%p]
I had Daru buy me a stun gun earlier. I pocket that too.[%p]
With this, my preparations are complete.[%p]
I give Suzuha a glance.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Let’s go, Uncle Okarin. One more time.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“One more trip to July 28th.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“There and back. That’s all the fuel we have left.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“This is our last chance.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...You ready?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Leave it to me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I... will change the world.”[%p]
I follow Suzuha into the time machine.[%p]
While waiting for Mayuri to return, I asked Suzuha if there was a chance that I might run into myself from last time -- in other words, the me who killed Kurisu.[%p]
She replied that wasn’t possible.[%p]
The worldline where I killed Kurisu is minutely different from the one to which the time machine will take us.[%p]
Time travel has a very small effect on divergence, much too small to cause any noticeable changes, but enough to ensure that there can never be two versions of the same time traveler. [%p]
However, it is important to remember that worldlines are not parallel worlds.[%p]
Ultimately, attractor field convergence merges them into a single worldline.[%p]
My actions are not meaningless. If I succeed in deceiving both myself and the world, the entire universe will converge upon a different future.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin.”[%p]
Mayuri leans through the hatch and gently strokes my cheek.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Come back, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course.”[%p]
I return the smile and give her a thumbs up.[%p]
I close the hatch as Daru and Mayuri see me off with words of encouragement.[%p]
Suzuha’s already operating the time machine.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The fate of the future hangs on this mission.”[%p]
Suzuha speaks as she presses some buttons.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“We’re counting on you, Uncle.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Instead of answering, I close my eyes.[%p]
I find myself strangely calm.[%p]
No impatience. No tension. None of the anxiety I felt the first time.[%p]
How many times have I tasted failure?[%p]
My hubris hurt those closest to me. My foolishness cost them their dreams.[%p]
And even though those mistakes have been undone, the memories still remain as a brand on my heart.[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You must not reject the three weeks you spent drifting between worldlines.”[%p]
[name]Okabe[line]“You must not undo the past!”[%p]
It all meant something.[%p]
Every mistake. Every sacrifice.[%p]
Without them, I would not be standing here now.[%p]
From that knowledge, I draw strength, confidence, and pride. The memories I shoulder deserve nothing less.[%p]
And so, I am no longer afraid.[%p]
I will reach the unknown worldline, Steins Gate.[%p]
Its future is uncertain. But that is how it should be.[%p]
For once, I need not worry what fate has in store.[%p]
Only one thing matters now.[%p]
Saving Kurisu.[%p]
Gravity pulls at my back.[%p]
Rainbow lights start drifting through the compartment.[%p]
It’s time.[%p]
This is my Ragnarok.[%p]
I exit the time machine onto the familiar rooftop.[%p]
As before, it’s empty. I can see the top of the train station a short distance away.[%p]
This is the third time I’ve been here now.[%p]
I run through the plan in my head one last time.[%p]
Time is short, but I have no choice. I have to do it.[%p]
No. I [color index="A0140000"]will[color index="800000"] do it. Failure isn’t an option.[%p]
I wait for Suzuha to break the lock, then I run inside just like last time.[%p]
Narrowly avoiding the first me again, I descend to the seventh floor.[%p]
Last time, I went all the way down to the fourth floor. But not this time.[%p]
I direct my attention to the capsule toy machines near the landing.[%p]
It’s time for step one.[%p]
“RaiNet Kakeru Character Doll Series”[%p]
This is it. On July 28th, the first me won a super rare Metal Upa from this very machine.[%p]
No time to waste. I insert the 100 yen coin I prepared beforehand and turn the lever hard.[%p]
A capsule falls into the slot.[%p]
Just as I grab it...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Look! RaiNet!”[%p]
My heart leaps into my throat.[%p]
That was Mayuri’s voice.[%p]
She’s already here!?[%p]
I quickly turn and leave the area before Mayuri can see my face.[%p]
Luckily, she’s so entranced by the capsule toy machines that she doesn’t realize who I am.[%p]
Once I get down to the fourth floor, I check the contents of the capsule.[%p]
The metal Upa is inside.[%p]
This is the prize that was meant for me.[%p]
Which means the first me will get--[%p]
The answer is obvious. Phase one is complete. Time for phase two.[%p]
I turn around abruptly.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Ah!”[%p]
Kurisu is standing behind me, her mouth open in surprise.[%p]
My timing was perfect.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“H-hey, you just came down from the--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I’m going to save you.”[%p]
Leave everything to me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What?”[%p]
I say no more. If I tell her everything, she’ll have no reason to talk to the first me.[%p]
On July 28th, she came to me during Nakabachi’s presentation. She claimed that I had tried to tell her something, then proceeded to drag me out into the hallway for further questioning.[%p]
That is part of my experience. This should be enough to ensure that it happens exactly as I remember.[%p]
I pat Kurisu on the shoulder, then race back up the stairs.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“W-wait!”[%p]
I run to the sixth floor, then creep up towards the seventh floor landing until I can just make out the capsule toy machines.[%p]
As expected, there’s the first me about to turn the lever in Mayuri’s stead.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ah, it’s an Upa!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is it rare?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s not rare, but isn’t it just so cute? Mayushii loves Upa!”[%p]
I grin to myself.[%p]
It worked. The order changed.[%p]
Mayuri now has a regular Upa, not the metal one I gave her the first time.[%p]
And that means...[%p]
[name]Presenter[line]“Thank you all for coming to Doctor Nakabachi’s Time Machine Press Conference.”[%p]
The presentation is about to begin.[%p]
The first me heads up to the eighth floor.[%p]
But Mayuri doesn’t move. She takes out a pen and starts signing the Upa.[%p]
Just as planned.[%p]
When Doctor Nakabachi defected to Russia on August 21st, he had Mayuri’s Metal Upa with him.[%p]
If he has a plastic one instead, it should change the fate of the Nakabachi Paper.[%p]
But one question remains. How exactly did Mayuri’s Upa fall into Doctor Nakabachi’s hands?[%p]
I watch as Mayuri finishes signing her name. She nods in satisfaction, then runs after the first me.[%p]
Just before she gets to the stairs, she puts the Upa into her coat pocket.[%p]
But it doesn’t go in all the way. As she runs up the stairs, I see it fall out and roll away.[%p]
Mayuri is completely oblivious. A moment later, she disappears from sight.[%p]
I look at the Upa lying on the floor.[%p]
Does Nakabachi pick it up?[%p]
How? He’s in the middle of his presentation upstairs. He doesn’t have any opportunity.[%p]
That’s when Kurisu comes up from downstairs.[%p]
I quickly hide in the stairwell across the landing.[%p]
Kurisu reaches the seventh floor without noticing me. She finds the fallen Upa and picks it up.[%p]
So it was Kurisu who found the Upa...[%p]
The Butterfly Effect.[%p]
In three weeks, this completely innocuous event changes the outcome of an accidental fire on one of what must be thousands of planes flying that day.[%p]
By extension, it changes the fate of the entire human race.[%p]
Kurisu looks curiously at the Upa, then looks around as if searching for the owner.[%p]
Of course, Kurisu doesn’t know who Mayuri is.[%p]
At this point in time, those two aren’t even acquainted yet.[%p]
After realizing there’s no one around, Kurisu puts the Upa into her envelope and goes up to the eighth floor.[%p]
Now that I’ve seen what I need to see, I go upstairs too and head to the employee hallway.[%p]
