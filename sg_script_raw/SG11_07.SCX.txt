...Here’s where it gets serious.[%p]
I grip the Cyalume Saber and shake it silently, thus activating the red fluorescent reaction inside.[%p]
It’ll last about 10 minutes. It should get dim before Kurisu makes her appearance.[%p]
I know what I need to do.[%p]
The problem is that my window of opportunity is so slim.[%p]
Will I be able to handle the enraged Doctor Nakabachi?[%p]
One mistake, and Kurisu will die.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you afraid of, Hououin Kyouma?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Everything’s going according to plan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Operation Skuld is flawless. You spent fifteen years perfecting it, remember?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Believe in yourself. Believe in Hououin Kyouma.”[%p]
Hououin Kyouma will save Kurisu.[%p]
I close my eyes and wait for the time to come, hidden behind the same pile of cardboard boxes as last time.[%p]
I hear the sound of sparse applause from the event hall.[%p]
Which means I should be hearing footsteps soon...[%p]
There they are. Kurisu has come, right on time.[%p]
She leans against the wall and looks inside her envelope, smiling softly as she does.[%p]
And now, I know the reason behind that smile.[%p]
It’s the Upa inside.[%p]
She’s probably smiling at how adorable it is.[%p]
That smile really doesn’t suit you, Kurisu.[%p]
I stifle a chuckle.[%p]
I’m surprised I’m calm enough to feel that way, despite the current situation.[%p]
Once Nakabachi appears, that’s my signal to spring into action.[%p]
I’ll bring out the Cyalume Saber as soon as that bastard tries to take out his knife.[%p]
Then I’ll scare him away and stun Kurisu.[%p]
The stun gun I brought should handle both tasks flawlessly.[%p]
That’s the plan, at least.[%p]
The next set of footsteps echoes down the hallway.[%p]
Kurisu looks up.[%p]
I can’t see Nakabachi, but I know it’s him.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I wanted to talk.”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Are you listening, Papa?”[%p]
Even the words she speaks are the same.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“What is that?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I heard you were giving a presentation on time travel.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So I thought about it too. Could it be possible to make a time machine?”[%p]
The atmosphere is far from pleasant. Nakabachi doesn’t even try to hide his displeasure.[%p]
And the first me is probably at fault for that. At least partially.[%p]
Looks like it’s about time for Nakabachi to go ballistic.[%p]
I grip the Cyalume Saber and make one final check.[%p]
It’s already dimmed down. Now all I have to do is remove the cap at the tip, and the fake blood will--[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!?”[%p]
My breath catches in my throat.[%p]
In the darkness of my hiding spot, I bring the Cyalume Saber close to my eyes and peer inside.[%p]
The fake blood has begun to coagulate.[%p]
No. This shouldn’t happen. I was certain the liquid would remain fluid for around 30 minutes after losing luminescence.[%p]
Was it defective!?[%p]
Come to think of it, we never tested the Cyalume Saber.[%p]
It can only be used once before the tube needs to be replaced. Given the lab’s financial situation, we thought it would be a waste to use it, so we never did.[%p]
How could I have failed to consider this possibility!?[%p]
If I’d had half a brain, I would have brought a spare![%p]
This is bad. The plan is falling apart.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“I wasn’t shunned!”[%p]
Nakabachi’s shrill shriek startles me.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Those incompetent bastards were just jealous of my superiority. I was the one who gave up on them!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Please don’t yell...”[%p]
Time won’t stop for me.[%p]
How do I recover from this setback?[%p]
I can’t leave.[%p]
Nakabachi’s about to attack his daughter.[%p]
If I make my appearance after that, it’ll be the same as last time.[%p]
I’ll end up killing Kurisu again.[%p]
No matter what, I can’t let that happen![%p]
What do I do!?[%p]
Do I go back to the time machine and try again?[%p]
No. Remember what Suzuha said?[%p]
There’s not enough fuel for another trip.[%p]
This is my last chance![%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Um... we haven’t seen each other in a while. There’s a lot I want to talk about. You’re living in Aomori now, right?”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Leave.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh...”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Go back to America. Never show your face to me again.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But--”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“You want my [color index="A0140000"]opinion[color index="800000"]!? We’ll submit it [color index="A0140000"]jointly[color index="800000"]!? You don’t mean any of that! I know how you think!”[%p]
My heart is pounding. I’m sweating like crazy. It feels like I’ve just run a marathon.[%p]
I cover my mouth to suppress the sound of my breathing.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Is this pity!? How dare you!? You’re supposed to be my daughter!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I... I don’t understand. Please calm--”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“I am calm! Don’t tell me what to do!”[%p]
Nakabachi is about to snap.[%p]
Events are proceeding just like last time, barreling inexorably towards disaster.[%p]
Please, I find myself begging. Make time stop.[%p]
But another voice from within answers.[%p]
Are you [color index="A0140000"]praying[color index="800000"], Hououin Kyouma?[%p]
Have you forgotten?[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“I’ll tell you why I called you here today. I wanted to show you my research, research beyond even what you can imagine!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“I wanted to prove, once and for all, that you are nothing compared to me!”[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]Change the future.[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]Deceive the world.[%e]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“But that brat in the lab coat ruined everything! I know you were laughing at me too, don’t you deny it! How dare you treat your own father this way!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I wasn’t--”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“You want my opinion? Fine, I’ll give it to you.”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“I’m going to publish it myself. End of discussion.”[%p]
I won’t court the mercy of a heartless god.[%p]
I will save Kurisu myself.[%p]
She won’t die again.[%p]
Not at my hands.[%p]
Not at anyone’s.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re... stealing it?”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“...What did you say?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’re stealing my work? I didn’t think even you would do something like--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ah!”[%p]
Nakabachi strikes Kurisu on the cheek.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Who do you think you’re talking to!?”[%p]
It’s starting![%p]
Nakabachi puts his hands around Kurisu’s neck.[%p]
Her cries of agony fill my ears.[%p]
There’s still a way to prevent Kurisu’s death.[%p]
That puddle of blood I saw beneath Kurisu’s body.[%p]
There’s one more way to reproduce it.[%p]
One more way.[%p]
One last chance.[%p]
It’s a gamble, to be sure. Even if it succeeds, I don’t know what effect it might have on the Steins Gate worldline.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ah, uuh...”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“You can’t possibly understand how I feel! Why did you have to be so talented!? I detest you! I hate your very existence!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Nobody is allowed to be better than me! Understand!? Nobody! Especially not my own daughter!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“That’s why I abandoned you! I couldn’t bear the shame of being your father!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“It’s all your fault... it’s all your fault!”[%p]
It matters not.[%p]
I am Hououin Kyouma, the mad scientist who defies God.[%p]
My true desire is chaos.[%p]
I have no need for a predetermined future![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Stop!”[%p]
Calmly, I step out from my hiding spot.[%p]
Nakabachi looks at me in disbelief. His eyes are wide and bloodshot.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“You!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“You’re the brat who ruined my presentation!”[%p]
Nakabachi lets go of Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Guh, gah hoh gah hoh gah hoh...”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“How dare you show your face before me!? Why does everyone get in my way!?”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“I know! You and Kurisu planned this, didn’t you? Didn’t you!?”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“You brats won’t get away with this!”[%p]
Nakabachi pulls the knife from his pocket.[%p]
Its blade reflects cold light. Once I see that glint, I laugh disdainfully.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Try it, if you dare.”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“You... who are you!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“My name...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is Hououin Kyouma!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“What!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“’Houou’ for ’phoenix’, then ’in’, and finally the ’terrible truth’ that must never be revealed! Hououin Kyouma!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am the Bringer of Chaos. The Destroyer of Order.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And I am the one who will end your ambition!”[%p]
Kurisu staggers to her feet with her hand to her neck.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Run away!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Never!”[%p]
I dismiss Kurisu’s plea, and instead turn to Nakabachi with my arms spread wide.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s wrong, Doctor Nakabachi? Aren’t you going to kill me? Or have you lost your nerve?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course, a mere mortal can never slay a god such as I! Muhahaha!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“You little...!”[%p]
Nakabachi goes into a frenzy. He charges me with his knife point-first.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No! Papa, stop!”[%p]
Nakabachi has completely lost his mind. I can see it in his eyes.[%p]
He won’t stop.[%p]
And if he won’t stop...[%p]
Then I’ll stop him. With my own body.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can’t kill me! You’re nothing!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“DIE!”[%p]
The knife approaches. Its point glitters menacingly in the dim light. [%p]
Inches away. I don’t move a muscle.[%p]
This is my last chance.[%p]
I’ll do whatever it takes![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gah... ha...!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Haha... hehehe... hehehehehe...”[%p]
Intense pain rips through my abdomen.[%p]
I feel the cold steel sink into my body.[%p]
He did it...[%p]
He stabbed me... with the knife... that killed Kurisu![%p]
The pain flares. It feels like my insides are being torn out.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah, gaah, aaahh!”[%p]
Nakabachi yanks out the knife. Blood gushes from the open wound.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Haah, haah, gaha...”[%p]
The iron taste of blood spreads through my mouth.[%p]
Pain threatens to steal away my consciousness.[%p]
My body’s on fire.[%p]
My vision blurs.[%p]
I struggle desperately to stay on my feet.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“N-now who’s laughing... hehehehe... That’s what you get for mocking me!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Hee...!”[%p]
I whip out the stun gun and switch it on. The electric arc crackles to life inches away from Nakabachi’s face. He instantly turns pale.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Now you’ve done it...”[%p]
I spear him with my glare and take a step forward. A wave of nausea surges over me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gach...”[%p]
Blood spews from my throat.[%p]
But I don’t look away. I keep my eyes fixed on Nakabachi.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’ll regret this, old man!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m going... to kill you...”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Heeee...!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You and the girl... I’ll kill you both!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t move!”[%p]
Kurisu runs up to me.[%p]
She holds me and supports my body.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Lie down! I’ll call an ambulance!”[%p]
What is she doing trying to help me? Didn’t she hear me threaten to kill her?[%p]
You’re too soft-hearted for a tsundere. Back when I was trying to save Mayuri, you were always the one who saved me. So this time--[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m going to save you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What--”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“----”[%p]
Kurisu convulses.[%p]
Strength leaves the legs she used to support me.[%p]
She collapses.[%p]
I’m sorry.[%p]
I send her my silent apology.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll be sure... to have my way with your daughter... before I kill her...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But first... is you, Nakabachi!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Muhahahaha...”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Heeeeee!”[%p]
Nakabachi tosses his knife away with a pitiful cry.[%p]
He takes a step back. Two steps back.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Hyeehhhhhh!”[%p]
Firing the stungun once more does the trick. Nakabachi turns and flees down the hallway toward the elevators.[%p]
But first, he makes sure to pick up the envelope Kurisu dropped. How shrewd of him.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Haah... haah... haah...”[%p]
I touch my wound.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ugg...”[%p]
The lightest touch sends pain coursing through my body. I fall to my knees.[%p]
I feel faint.[%p]
The bleeding won’t stop.[%p]
The blood is starting to pool on the floor.[%p]
I press my hands into the blood.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Still... not enough...”[%p]
I reach for my stomach, wet and glistening with blood.[%p]
I take a breath, then drive my fingers into the wound.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gah!”[%p]
The pain is like nothing I’ve ever experienced.[%p]
Unable to bear it, I throw back my head.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!”[%p]
I scream until my throat is raw.[%p]
I can’t stop now![%p]
Fighting against the urge to faint, I feed strength into my hands and pull the wound wider.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gach, haah, haah, gghh, khah...”[%p]
My blood paints the floor crimson.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle Okarin!”[%p]
Suzuha runs up to me.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Th-that wound! What happened!? What were you thinking!?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If you die... if we fail...!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh... heh heh...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You forget who you’re dealing with, Suzuha.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Look at the floor... notice anything?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The floor?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh... that should be enough blood... don’t you think?”[%p]
She looks down and beholds my masterpiece.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“A pool of blood!”[%p]
To deceive myself.[%p]
To deceive the world.[%p]
The stage is set![%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But Uncle, you’ll die!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh, there’s no way I’m going to die...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who do you think I am?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Uncle...”[%p]
If convergence holds, then it’s already determined that I don’t die. Not here.[%p]
I die in 2025. That’s a fixed event on the Beta worldline.[%p]
That was my bet.[%p]
I intentionally provoked Nakabachi to rage.[%p]
I took the knife meant for Kurisu and survived.[%p]
The wound gave me what I needed to carry out the plan.[%p]
Though I have to admit, I didn’t think it would hurt this much.[%p]
There’s no telling what will happen when we reach Steins Gate.[%p]
The future of that worldline is still undecided. There’s no reason it can’t include my death.[%p]
How ironic. I made a bet based on the guarantee that I wouldn’t die, but winning that bet makes death a very real possibility.[%p]
I twist my lips into a smile. Time to put the finishing touch on my masterpiece.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Suzuha... get Kurisu...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Ah, okay!”[%p]
Suzuha picks up the unconscious Kurisu.[%p]
Then she lays her face down on top of my blood puddle.[%p]
Kurisu doesn’t wake up. She’s perfectly still.[%p]
But she’s definitely breathing.[%p]
I stroke her hair gently.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did it hurt? I’m sorry... but I had to do it... to save you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Even though those three weeks... will never come back...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I want you to live.”[%p]
Even if we reach Steins Gate.[%p]
Even if Kurisu lives.[%p]
Even if I don’t die.[%p]
We’ll never meet again.[%p]
Kurisu will never join the lab.[%p]
We will never build the Time Leap Machine together.[%p]
But still, I’m glad I was able to save her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Goodbye.”[%p]
Please stay unconscious for a while.[%p]
I need you to deceive the first me.[%p]
While Suzuha goes to pick up the knife, I use the wall to climb to my feet.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mission... complete. Return to base...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“This is crazy, Uncle. You’re insane!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Insane? Nonsense. This is all... according to plan... heh heh... heh...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Don’t talk. I’ll take you back to August 21st.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Try to endure the Gs, okay? Damn! I should’ve brought a first aid kit.”[%p]
I feel pressure crush my body.[%p]
My wound throbs. I feel like groaning, but I bite my lip and bear it.[%p]
Rainbow lights fill my vision.[%p]
The time machine is activating.[%p]
Suzuha wraps my wound with a towel.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hey, Uncle. I’m sure Steins Gate is waiting for us on the other side. A world where nothing is known, where anything is possible.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“A world where you live, where Makise Kurisu lives, where Shiina Mayuri lives.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“A world where I have no reason to travel to 2010.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The future may still lead to World War Three...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It may lead to a dystopia ruled by SERN...”[%p]
Someone’s warm hand grasps mine.[%p]
Tightly. Tightly.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But now, there is hope for the future again.”[%p]
I slowly close my eyes.[%p]
It’s hard to breathe.[%p]
But my pain feels distant now.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Once we arrive, I’ll probably disappear. I won’t be able to thank you for bringing me to Steins Gate.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So I’ll say it now.”[%p]
The warmth of her hand slowly fades away.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Thank you, Uncle. Don’t die. Live.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And in seven years... let’s meet again, okay?”[%p]
[margin top="228"][center]It’s time to go home.[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]Mayuri and Daru are waiting.[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]And with them, a future that has yet to be written.[%e]
