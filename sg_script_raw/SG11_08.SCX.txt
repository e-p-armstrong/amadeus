It’s been a month since then.[%p]
My wound was deep enough to require surgery.[%p]
If I’d been just one hour late getting to the hospital, I would have died from blood loss.[%p]
The doctor laughed as he told me this. Hilarious.[%p]
After being cooped up in the hospital for so long, it’s exciting to be walking around Akiba again.[%p]
I look around to see if Akiba’s any different from what I remember, but nothing catches my eye.[%p]
I just get the feeling that there are more moe shops than before.[%p]
The mysteries of divergence.[%p]
I chuckle to myself, then dig into my pocket.[%p]
Something jingles.[%p]
There are metal pins inside. Eight of them.[%p]
The Future Gadget Laboratory’s member badges, their design based on the pin Suzuha brought from the future.[%p]
Which worldline’s Suzuha was that again?[%p]
Anyway, back then, we searched all over Akiba for that pin.[%p]
And while I was hospitalized, I thought it was the perfect opportunity to ask Daru to have them made.[%p]
And of course, the one we commissioned to make them was that shady foreign street vendor.[%p]
The final product is slightly different from Suzuha’s, but it’s pretty well-done.[%p]
I pass through the archway of Yanabayashi Shrine and head to the courtyard. There, brandishing a sword with sublime dignity, stands a miko.[%p]
The miko is so lovely that anyone would doubtless stop to stare.[%p]
But that’s not a miko, and that’s not a real sword.[%p]
That sword is a 980 yen imitation, and that beautiful miko... is a guy.[%p]
Lukako lifts his head at the sound of my footsteps.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san!”[%p]
As soon as our eyes meet, he runs up to me in a fluster.[%p]
His eyes are already wet with tears.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“You were discharged today?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“But... I’m sorry! I didn’t know anything about it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course you didn’t. I didn’t tell you.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“But I’m glad you’re okay. I’m... I’m so happy...”[%p]
And then he starts crying in earnest.[%p]
Seeing his tears, I feel an urge to pat his head and tell him everything will be alright, but I resist and sigh instead.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I hear you were a natural at your cosplay debut. I hear you even have a fan club.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Augh...”[%p]
Mayuri filled me in on the situation.[%p]
After years of persistent nagging, she finally convinced Lukako to cosplay near the end of summer break.[%p]
It wasn’t in time for ComiMa, but he wore one of Mayuri’s costumes to a cosplay event in early September. His cosplay debut was... effective.[%p]
Dozens of photographers took his picture, and the images soon went viral on the net.[%p]
Try to look up pictures of Lukako now, and you’ll get a ton of hits.[%p]
He’s being swarmed by fans. And since he’s what they call a “trap,” he’s popular with girls, too.[%p]
There are some things in this world I just don’t understand.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“To be honest, it’s so confusing...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You know, I still haven’t had the pleasure to see you cosplay in the flesh.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I... I just can’t. If Okabe-san were to see me... I’d get so embarrassed, I’d die.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But you had fun, didn’t you? That’s what Mayuri said.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...Yes.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’ve grown up, Lukako.”[%p]
He’s overcome his feelings of inadequacy and accepted himself for who he is.[%p]
And he even had fun doing it.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-sa... I mean, Kyouma-san, it’s all thanks to the Seishin Zanma style you taught me.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’ve cleared my mind of all mundane thoughts.”[%p]
He truly is a worthy disciple.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But you must not grow complacent. Your next objective is to ascend to the true form of the Seishin Zanma style. Once you’ve mastered it, the flames of evil sealed within you will have nothing left to burn.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That moment will mark the beginning of the legend of Urushibara Luka, Guardian Miko of the Personapolis of Akihabara!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Umm, what exactly will this legend be about?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I shall tell you at the proper time.”[%p]
I reach into my pocket, and take out a pin.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lab Mem Number 006, Urushibara Luka. I grant this unto you.”[%p]
Lukako nervously accepts the pin with a confused expression.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Um... when did I become a lab mem?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s a memory from beyond the veil of time. Your past life, I suppose you could say.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“M-my past life?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’ve been a lab mem from the moment you were born. Be proud.”[%p]
It’s not an exaggeration. It’s the truth.[%p]
Lukako most likely doesn’t remember.[%p]
But it’s okay, even if I’m the only one who does.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You don’t like it?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“No, it’s just... I’m really happy... sniff.”[%p]
He starts crying again.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I always wanted... to be a part of your lab... I wanted to be one of you...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“But... I never had the courage to ask...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Thank you so much.”[%p]
He bows his head.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is a precious artifact. Only eight of them exist in the entire world. It’s a magic item that protects you from all calamity.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“R-really?”[%p]
No.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So don’t lose it.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I won’t!”[%p]
Lukako nods, with a joyful smile on his face.[%p]
...Too cute.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Welcome back, myaster♪”[%p]
I pass through MayQueen’s door for the first time in forever. Faris runs over to greet me.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma!”[%p]
She suddenly links arms with me.[%p]
At first, I get a little flustered when something soft touches my elbow. But then I break into cold sweat once I feel the murderous glares of the surrounding Faris fans.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“They let you outta the hospital, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Y-yeah. I managed to claw my way out of hell.”[%p]
I tear Faris off of me and take a deep breath.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Purrcisely what I expected from the Hououin bloodline... The name of the undying phoenix isn’t just for show, nya.”[%p]
I see she’s still making up her own backstories for people.[%p]
It boggles the mind that this crazy catgirl is behind the redevelopment of Akihabara. Maybe the world’s just messed up.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Mayushii has the day off, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I know.”[%p]
She shows me to my table, where I order iced coffee.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Oh, right. We decided to open a second MayQueen location, nya. And it’s right on Chuo-dori, nyan. Isn’t that awesome, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t you think you’re abusing your authority as redevelopment committee chair? Just a little?”[%p]
No doubt the recent explosion of moe shops is her doing. I think she’s getting just a little carried away.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“This is my sacred duty, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]”Now is the time to summon all the powers of moe to this holy land in preparation for [color index="A0140000"]their[color index="800000"] offensive, nya.” [%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? They’re going to attack? Did the Awakening occur while I was in the hospital?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“That’s right, nya. They took your absence as their opportunity, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Will we be able to complete the moefication of Akiba before they hatch? That’s the only way to defeat them! It’s a race against time, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris also fought in the RaiNet AB tournament to gather Karma, but it was really tough by myself, nya.”[%p]
What the hell does she mean by “Karma”?[%p]
Over the past month, Faris has started participating in RaiNet AccessBattlers tournaments.[%p]
Faris is the chairman of the Akihabara redevelopment project, a high school student, a popular waitress at a maid cafe, the president of the company founded by her father, and the head of the Akiha family.[%p]
She should be incredibly busy, but I guess she couldn’t stay away from RaiNet forever.[%p]
Anyway, she went to her very first official tournament and snatched a dramatic victory.[%p]
Faris is even more cheerful than usual now.[%p]
I guess all it takes to feel fulfilled is to do the things you like to do.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I need your mad scientist powers to stop them, nya. If they make it into town, they’ll make the place their litter box!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I guess I have no choice. If it’s come to this, then I too must fulfill the Covenant.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh yeah, and take this with you.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nya?”[%p]
I take a pin out of my pocket and present it to Faris.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“This is...! Where did you get this, Kyouma!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“During my stay at the hospital.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So you’ve overcome the Test of the Heart, nya. You truly are a great man, nya.”[%p]
I don’t really get what’s going on, so let’s just nod for now.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This belongs to you, Lab Mem Number 007.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whenever you need my help, just hold that pin and speak the incantation ’La Yohda Stasella’.”[%p]
Faris and I smile at each other.[%p]
And then we high five.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Thanks, nya! The Future Gadget Laboratory is the hope of Akiba, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Can I come over for a visit, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course you can. Daru will be glad to see you.”[%p]
When I get back to the lab, I’m startled to find an unexpected visitor.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Yo, Okabe. Outta the hospital already?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Uh, yeah...”[%p]
Tennouji Yuugo and Nae are standing out front. Kiryu Moeka is with them.[%p]
The Rounders, who killed Mayuri on another worldline.[%p]
Nae hides behind her father when she sees me, like usual.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Oh yeah, lemme introduce ya.”[%p]
Tennouji indicates Moeka with his chin.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Starting today, this girl’s gonna work part-time at my place.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka bows her head.[%p]
She’s silent as always, but at least she’s not holding her phone. I guess that’s some improvement.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Doesn’t talk much, but don’t let it bother you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry. Shining Finger and I know each other already.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Shining Finger? Who’s that?”[%p]
I point to Moeka.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Shining Finger! That’s the name of her esper power.”[%p]
Tennouji and Moeka ignore me completely.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“He helped me look... for an IBN 5100...”[%p]
I got a thank you email from her during my stay in the hospital.[%p]
That email helped me figure out our relationship on this worldline.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Oh, that retro PC you were talking about? Did you find one?”[%p]
Moeka shakes her head.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Well, it is just an urban legend.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Why did you decide to work here?”[%p]
Did Tennouji tell her who he is?[%p]
I thought Moeka wasn’t supposed to know FB’s true identity.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I brought her.”[%p]
Nae speaks up in a tiny voice.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“I introduced her to Daddy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see... so you’re a matchmaker, huh.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Hey, numbskull! There’s only two things I love in this world: Braun Tubes, and my little girl.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“D-Daddy...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Besides, it was more like the other way around. After Nae fell and got hurt, this girl gave her first aid and brought her all the way back here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I didn’t know Moeka had such a gentle side...”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Since she was unemployed, I decided to give her a job as thanks for helping my girl.”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Never thought our store would hire a part-timer.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Didn’t you hire one just last month?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Huh? You high on yer painkillers, kid? I’ve never had help before.”[%p]
Ah, of course.[%p]
The Suzuha who worked here was the Suzuha of the Alpha worldline -- the Suzuha who came from a future ruled by SERN.[%p]
The current worldline has a different future, so she didn’t come. The time she spent here never happened.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Well, in that case, good luck to you, Moeka.”[%p]
This is the perfect opportunity. I take a pin out of my pocket and hand it to Moeka.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...Um?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Oh, now you’re flirting? Don’t mess around with my part-timer.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This pin is proof that you are Lab Mem Number 005. Our lab is on the second floor. Come on by whenever you feel like it.”[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“...”[%p]
Moeka stares at the pin in her hand.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I can’t help you look for the IBN 5100 anymore, okay?”[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]“Don’t be like that. Help her out, will ya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t. I’m a busy man.”[%p]
Catch the attention of the Rounders again? No thanks.[%p]
Besides, the three of them are better off if we never find an IBN 5100.[%p]
I end the conversation with a shrug and head to the stairs.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Okabe-kun.”[%p]
Moeka calls my name.[%p]
I turn back to see Moeka smiling, ever so faintly.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]“Thank you... for this.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yeah.”[%p]
The hatred I once felt towards them is gone.[%p]
I forgave Moeka and Tennouji both.[%p]
Now that I’ve destroyed our time machine, we can go back to being good neighbors.[%p]
I won’t pry into their secret lives, and I won’t attempt to fight them either.[%p]
It’s all up to them.[%p]
However...[%p]
The affection that Nae showed towards Moeka brings an undeniable warmth to my heart.[%p]
Right as I walk into the lab, I’m greeted by the chiming of a microwave oven.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin!”[%p]
Mayuri smiles brightly as she takes her Juicy Chicken Number One out of the microwave.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪ Welcome backarin!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you just combine ’welcome back’ and ’Okarin’?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yup. I’ve said it before, remember?”[%p]
Then Mayuri holds out the steaming chicken.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Want some too? I’ll give you one to celebrate your homecoming♪”[%p]
I accept the gift of chicken and pop it into my mouth.[%p]
I guess it’s because I’ve had nothing but crappy hospital food for a month, but it’s so delicious I want to cry.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where did you get that microwave?”[%p]
We disassembled the PhoneWave (name subject to change) weeks ago.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, that was me.”[%p]
Daru pops out of the development room in all his rotund glory.[%p]
I wonder if he’s making a new Future Gadget.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You bought it?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I found it, duh. It was a pain to repair.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s kinda old, but it still works fine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s our super hacka. Now let’s keep up that pace and make the next Future Gadget.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That reminds me, Okarin. I’m mad at you!”[%p]
Mayuri suddenly puts on a pout.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Why did you leave the hospital without telling Mayushii?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“We went all the way to the hospital to pick you up, but the nurse said you’d already left!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“That was one hot nurse. I wish I was hospitalized instead of Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You think you’re my guardian now, Mayuri? Hmph, you’ve certainly come up in the world. Have you forgotten? I’m the one who protects you.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I even helped you with your diaper.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Guh...”[%p]
I couldn’t move at all after the operation. So my mother and Mayuri made the great effort of coming to care for me.[%p]
Especially Mayuri. Even though it was her summer break, she visited me every day.[%p]
I’m grateful for this childhood friend of mine, from the bottom of my heart.[%p]
She’s a ditz, to be sure, and seems like she always needs someone to look out for her, but she’s actually quite tough for her age.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You got your childhood friend to change your diaper? I’m jealous, man. What eroge is that from?”[%p]
I think Daru needs to die for a bit.[%p]
I bop Mayuri on the head.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll buy you some Juicy Chicken Number One later.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really? Thanks, Okarin! It was worth it to help you after all! Ehehe♪”[%p]
I breathe another sigh of relief when I see Mayuri’s innocent smile.[%p]
Mayuri is still alive.[%p]
I’ve seen her die countless times.[%p]
Though the events of those worldlines have been undone, my struggle to escape them was not in vain.[%p]
If the same thing were to happen again, what would I do?[%p]
Would I accept her death this time?[%p]
Or would I try again to save her, even if it meant building another time machine?[%p]
There’s no way to know.[%p]
The future is undecided.[%p]
But for now, Mayuri is here.[%p]
And that means everything to me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Here, take these.”[%p]
I give Mayuri and Daru their pins.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s so cute!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Nice, they’re finally done!”[%p]
Mayuri pins the badge to her chest and shows it off with a pirouette.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Gotta be sure to put this on every day. Or else I won’t be let into the lab!”[%p]
Nobody really made that rule, but whatever.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But you know, there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you about the pin.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s that?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“There’s an inscription, right? It says ’OSHMKUFA 2010’.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okabe, Shiina, Hashida. And then Urushibara and Faris. I got those. But what about M, K, and A? Who are they?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
M for Makise.[%p]
K for Kiryu.[%p]
A for Amane.[%p]
But the current Mayuri wouldn’t understand.[%p]
Those three were lab mems on a worldline undone and forgotten.[%p]
I haven’t told Mayuri or Daru about them.[%p]
They wouldn’t believe me even if I told them. Especially about the last initial, A.[%p]
I mean, how do I tell Daru he’s going to have a daughter?[%p]
I can just imagine his reaction.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Who’s my lucky bride-to-be? I hope she’s got a cute face, and delicious flat chest, and blonde hair, and twintails, and a golden ratio tsundere personality. And when she’s in dere-mode, she’s super cuddly and sexy!”[%p]
He’d say something gross like that. No doubt.[%p]
I remember.[%p]
As I lay dying in the time machine, Suzuha gripped my hand and said...[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Once we arrive, I’ll probably disappear. I won’t be able to thank you for bringing me to Steins Gate.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So I’ll thank you now.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Thank you, Uncle. Don’t die. Live.”[%p]
Just as she predicted, Suzuha vanished the moment we returned to August 21st.[%p]
Right before my very eyes, the time machine was enveloped in rainbow light and disappeared.[%p]
She was smiling as she faded away.[%p]
That was proof I had reached Steins Gate.[%p]
And that’s why I don’t mourn Suzuha.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And in seven years... let’s meet again, okay?”[%p]
I don’t know what the future will bring. There’s still the possibility that Daru won’t get married -- that Suzuha won’t be born.[%p]
But still, I believe. That in seven years, we will meet again.[%p]
And that’s when I will give her this pin, her birthright as Lab Mem 008.[%p]
Until then, I’ll keep it in a safe place.[%p]
I aimlessly head out to town, alone.[%p]
I want to get a better look at the Steins Gate worldline.[%p]
But try as I may, I can’t find anything drastically different.[%p]
Way back when, Faris’s D-Mail erased the moe shops from Akiba. That time, it was obvious that the world had changed.[%p]
I feel unsatisfied, so I look up at Radi-Kan.[%p]
Obviously, there’s no satellite stuck in the roof.[%p]
It’s open for business as usual.[%p]
When I arrived on this worldline, right after I saw Suzuha disappear, the very first thing I did was ask Mayuri and Daru a question.[%p]
“Have there been any murders at Radi-Kan?”[%p]
As they panicked at the sight of my bloodstained body, they answered that no one had been murdered at Radi-Kan.[%p]
As we waited for the ambulance to arrive, I had Daru call up the news on my phone.[%p]
They were running the story about Nakabachi’s flight to Russia.[%p]
This time, Nakabachi looked terribly agitated.[%p]
His eyes were bloodshot. He was yelling, spraying spit everywhere. His appearance was strikingly similar to how I last saw him in the hallway of Radi-Kan.[%p]
To me, his unintelligible rambling was evidence of Operation Skuld’s success.[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“This is an outrage! An outrage!! A fire!? How can that happen!?”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“My precious thesis was burned to a crisp! The future of humanity went up in flames! This is no time for an interview!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“I won’t stand for this, Russian Airlines! I’ll murder every last one of your crew members!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Money’s not the issue! Aren’t you listening!? You burned my thesis! My thesis, which would have changed human history forever!”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“I should never have let you fools handle my suitcase! None of this would’ve happened if I’d just carried it with me!”[%p]
The subtitles read “What was your thesis about?”[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]“Time travel! The invention that can grant control over all space-time, from past to present to future!”[%p]
The screen immediately returned to the studio, where a female reporter continued.[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]“This outburst continued for some time.”[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]“Doctor Nakabachi, also known as Makise Shouichi, was detained by Russian authorities upon arrival at Domodedovo International Airport in Moscow.”[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]“Makise is currently under investigation by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department as a suspect in the July 28th stabbing of a young man--”[%p]
I don’t think anyone’s going to listen to Nakabachi now.[%p]
For argument’s sake, let’s say Nakabachi manages to recreate Kurisu’s thesis from memory.[%p]
Nothing will come of it as long as Kurisu is alive.[%p]
The scientific community undoubtedly trusts the Makise daughter over the father, meaning Kurisu can deter any attempts made by Nakabachi.[%p]
World War Three won’t break out. Or at the very least, it won’t be over the Nakabachi Paper.[%p]
I haven’t seen Kurisu.[%p]
Apparently, Kurisu reported to the police that I was stabbed. But at present, there has been no progress on the investigation, as the victim -- from their point of view -- up and disappeared.[%p]
I heard from Daru that no one was murdered at Radi-Kan, and I couldn’t find a single report of anyone dying in the area that day.[%p]
Kurisu is still alive. That much is certain. But I haven’t had any contact with her since then.[%p]
Aside from the few words we exchanged at Radi-Kan, the current Kurisu and I are strangers. Besides, I was bedridden, so it’s not like I could have gone to see her even if I had wanted to.[%p]
Kurisu said that she was supposed to go back to America in August.[%p]
That was on the Alpha worldline, so things may have changed. But what reason would she have to stay in Japan after what her father did to her?[%p]
I thrust my hand into my pocket.[%p]
Two pins remain.[%p]
One of them is for Lab Mem 001. That’s me.[%p]
The remaining badge, which belongs to Lab Mem 004, may never reach its rightful owner.[%p]
But Kurisu is alive, and that’s good enough for me.[%p]
I once chose to let her die.[%p]
I once killed her with my own two hands.[%p]
But this time, I was able to save her.[%p]
No one remembers those three weeks we spent with Kurisu.[%p]
No one but me. I will remember. I will never forget.[%p]
So I don’t need anything else. I don’t want anything else.[%p]
Hey, Kurisu.[%p]
I don’t know what the future holds.[%p]
War may still break out.[%p]
SERN may still complete their time machine.[%p]
But at the very least, the future is undecided.[%p]
We’re building it now. From the bottom up. Not just me. Not just you. But every man, woman, and child.[%p]
So keep on watching, wherever in this wide world you may be.[%p]
I take out my own pin and fasten it to my chest.[%p]
I walk through the sea of shoppers, staring straight ahead.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...eh?”[%p]
I quickly turn around.[%p]
Just now, in the corner of my eye, I saw her.[%p]
The girl who shouldn’t be here.[%p]
Her long hair fluttered as she passed me by.[%p]
There.[%p]
A familiar figure. I’d recognize that back anywhere.[%p]
She has stopped too, in the middle of the sidewalk.[%p]
Slowly, slowly, she turns to face me.[%p]
It’s her.[%p]
I thought she had gone back to America.[%p]
It’s her.[%p]
She doesn’t even know me.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s you!”[%p]
That voice.[%p]
That face.[%p]
That hair.[%p]
Those eyes.[%p]
Makise Kurisu is standing there, the same as I remember her.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’ve been looking everywhere for you!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Ever since you saved my life.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I was afraid I’d never have a chance to say thank you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m so glad we could finally meet.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thank you. Thank you so much.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And thank goodness you’re alright.”[%p]
Kurisu looks so radiant as she tries to hold back her tears.[%p]
Just when I thought I had finally suppressed it, all my love for her flows out at once.[%p]
I’m so happy that I want to cry too.[%p]
So, to hide my embarrassment, I take out my phone and put it to my ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. Why is she here? Reading Steiner didn’t activate.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What? Protect her!? Heh... that’s a tall order, my friend.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But if that is the choice of Steins Gate... then so be it. El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
I close my phone and clear my throat.[%p]
I have no idea what to say.[%p]
She’s still staring at me with those wide, pleading eyes.[%p]
I open my mouth.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We meet again, Christina.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“How many times do I have to tell you!? I’m not Christina, or your assistant or--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Eh?”[%p]
Now I really have no idea what to say.[%p]
How does this Kurisu know about that?[%p]
Those were the names I used to tease Kurisu.[%p]
She always got mad whenever I used them.[%p]
They were our bond, our private joke.[%p]
But I had yet to use them on the day we first met at Radi-Kan.[%p]
So how could this worldline’s Kurisu know?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Huh? I... why did I say that?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Words just... popped into my head...”[%p]
It looks like Kurisu is as confused as I am.[%p]
She stares at me, bewildered.[%p]
And then, I finally realize the truth.[%p]
Everyone has Reading Steiner.[%p]
Even if the worldline changes. Even if the past and the future are rewritten.[%p]
Your memories remain.[%p]
You’ve merely forgotten. All it takes is a push, and you can remember.[%p]
The memories of those lost three weeks.[%p]
The memories we made together.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Welcome back, my assistant, Makise Kurisu -- no, Christina.”[%p]
I reach into my pocket and take out the last pin.[%p]
Nobody knows what the future holds.[%p]
And that is why, just as this reunion demonstrates, the possibilities are endless.[%p]
I place the pin in Kurisu’s hand. I gently close her hand in mine.[%p]
And, holding back my tears, I tell her...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is the choice of Steins Gate.”[%p]
