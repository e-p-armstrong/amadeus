[name]Rintaro[line]“...ah.”[%p]
The world twists.[%p]
My legs shake.[%p]
I cover my eyes and wait for my senses to return to normal.[%p]
A thousand emotions stampede through my skull, then fade away.[%p]
I stare vacantly at Kurisu, who is standing in front of me.[%p]
At first, I can’t hear her over the buzzing in my ears, but little by little, her voice becomes clear.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...see? You’re shaking. We’ve only been at it for two days and you’re already exhausted.”[%p]
Kurisu thrusts her finger at me like an angry schoolteacher.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“We still have plenty of time to find the pin. You don’t have to be in such a hurry.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If you collapse, what then? I won’t be worried about you, but Mayuri sure will.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Take care of yourself. Got it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
The time leap worked.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah... got it.”[%p]
I nod to Kurisu, then collapse onto the sofa.[%p]
...I couldn’t sacrifice either of them.[%p]
In a sense, I am running away.[%p]
But there was no other choice.[%p]
No other way to save Suzuha and Mayuri both.[%p]
In two days, Mayuri will die, and Suzuha will be lost to the past.[%p]
If these two days are all we have left...[%p]
Then all I can do is repeat them.[%p]
Forever.[%p]
Let these two days be the rest of my life.[%p]
The wind caresses my cheek.[%p]
I push down on the pedals and begin the ascent up Harumi Bridge.[%p]
The spokes revolve rhythmically, reflecting the sunlight.[%p]
Sweat oozes out of every pore, but it’s not unpleasant.[%p]
It feels good, healthy, like running around the school field as a child.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The weather’s so nice!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whew, hee, why did I have to come along?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Same... here... haah, whew... the wind’s... too strong...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’re a little chubby, Daru-kun. I think you need to exercise more!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Fat neckbeard master race...”[%p]
Leading the way at a terrific pace is Suzuha on her trusty mountain bike.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What a view!”[%p]
From here, you can see across Tokyo Bay, all the way to Rainbow Bridge in the distance.[%p]
Akiba and the jumbled sprawl of central Tokyo are two hours ride behind us. Here on this artificial island there are only skyscrapers and vacant lots -- one extreme or the other.[%p]
One time, I took the bus back to Akiba after ComiMa, so I already knew how close it was. But I never thought I’d come here by bike.[%p]
Except for Suzuha, we’re all using rent-a-cycles.[%p]
I wanted a change of pace from the search for the unfindable pin, so I proposed this cycling expedition.[%p]
Of course, I already know who the pin belongs to, and who Suzuha’s father is.[%p]
But I have chosen not to tell anyone.[%p]
If at all possible, I want to spend these two days in peace, and delay Suzuha’s time travel.[%p]
That is my goal now.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I thought this trip would be a waste of time at first, but I guess people need to take a break once in a while!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’d rather... be working... on the time leap machine...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“This... just proves... that I belong... indoors...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You two are all worn out! Ehehe!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Come on, guys! Stamina is the key to survival!”[%p]
Kurisu and Daru are exhausted, while Suzuha and Mayuri are still going strong.[%p]
I already know the distance between Akiba and Ariake, so I’m able to pace myself in order to conserve energy.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“W-water! Where’s a vending machine!? I could kill for a glass of water!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry, but there’s no convenience store until we cross another bridge after this one. Tough it out.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Y-you serious? I can’t, it’s impossible...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow, Okarin. You really know the area. Have you been here before?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yeah. Many times.”[%p]
How long have I been living in this closed loop of time?[%p]
It’s already getting hard to keep track of the days, so instead I think in two-day cycles.[%p]
This should be the fourth cycle.[%p]
This time, only I know that Mayuri is fated to die.[%p]
By keeping that secret, I allow us to spend these days like normal kids our age would.[%p]
This cycling expedition is part of that.[%p]
Suzuha and Mayuri enjoy the ride, so I make sure we do it each time I repeat the loop. [%p]
Our current destination is Tokyo Big Sight, the massive convention center in Ariake.[%p]
In a few days, it will be home to ComiMa, the world’s largest doujinshi marketplace event.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Big Sight’s straight ahead. It shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes to get there.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Let’s take a break first...”[%p]
Daru has used up the last of his strength. While still on his bike, he rests his body against the guardrail separating us from the road.[%p]
I turn and pull up next to Daru’s bike.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not safe there. Come on.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Let me rest!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I said it’s not safe.”[%p]
I sigh and pull Daru up by the arm.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okay, okay!”[%p]
Daru stands up.[%p]
A second later--[%p]
A huge truck speeds past.[%p]
The gust of wind left in its wake nearly bowls us over.[%p]
The bridge sways beneath our feet.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Th-that was close!”[%p]
It probably wouldn’t have hit him anyway, but still. Best to be careful.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You saved me, Okarin...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You know, that was almost like Okarin saw the future!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You got a D-Mail, didn’t you?”[%p]
Mayuri’s innocent smile.[%p]
Kurisu’s cynical grin.[%p]
To them, it’s a joke, but they’re not mistaken.[%p]
The only thing they got wrong was that I didn’t send a D-Mail. I time leaped.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha’s eyes meet mine.[%p]
She was laughing just a moment ago, but now she looks confused, uncertain.[%p]
I...[%p]
Avert my eyes.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Holy Land, I have returned!”[%p]
Daru, his vigor restored, faces Big Sight with his arms spread wide.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow... I’ve never seen it this empty...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Look at all that space. It’s hard to believe they fill this whole area during ComiMa.”[%p]
In the emptiness, it is easy to see how truly majestic Big Sight is.[%p]
At ComiMa, when you’re wading through a sea of people, it’s just another big building.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey! Mayushii’s hungry!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Isn’t there a restaurant nearby? Let’s take a break.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I can’t believe we have to bike all the way back. What a nightmare...”[%p]
The three of them go searching for the family restaurant.[%p]
Suzuha is still gazing at Big Sight.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s wrong, Suzuha?”[%p]
I ask the question, though I already know how she’ll answer.[%p]
She’s excited to see Big Sight in real life.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’m excited to see Big Sight in real life.”[%p]
Suzuha’s eyes are shining.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s gone by 2036, you know.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“They cleared it to make way for bigger, better convention centers. Tokyo’s full of them in my time. They even moved the Dome out there.”[%p]
Suzuha points to the middle of Tokyo Bay.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hashida Itaru called it the Holy Land. Is that how you see it in this time?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So this is where they have ComiMa... I’ve heard of it. Hundreds of thousands of people come, right? Mom said that’s where she met my dad.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ahh, so your mother was a fujoshi.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I’ve always wanted to see this place. Thank you, Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I feel... closer to my dad now.”[%p]
A sharp pain stabs through my heart.[%p]
I know who Suzuha’s father is.[%p]
He’s right over there.[%p]
But I won’t tell her.[%p]
Not until the afternoon of the 13th, when the Time Leap Machine is complete.[%p]
For now, I just want to prolong these two days of peace.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin! Suzu-san! Come on, come on!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s us. Come on! I’m starving.”[%p]
Suzuha grabs my hand and we take off running.[%p]
Somehow, I manage to force a smile.[%p]
Today was fun.[%p]
Tomorrow will be fun.[%p]
Every day will be fun, forever.[%p]
The wind caresses my cheek.[%p]
I push down on the pedals and begin the ascent up Harumi Bridge.[%p]
The spokes revolve slowly, reflecting the sunlight.[%p]
Sweat oozes out of every pore, but it’s not unpleasant.[%p]
It feels good, healthy, like running around the school field as a child.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The weather’s so nice!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whew, hee, why did I have to come along?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Same... here... haah, whew... the wind’s... too strong...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’re a little chubby, Daru-kun. I think you need to exercise more!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Fat neckbeard master race...”[%p]
Leading the way at a terrific pace is Suzuha on her trusty mountain bike.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What a view!”[%p]
From here, you can see across Tokyo Bay, all the way to Rainbow Bridge in the distance.[%p]
Except for Suzuha, we’re all using rent-a-cycles.[%p]
I wanted a change of pace from the search for the unfindable pin, so I proposed this cycling expedition.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I thought this trip would be a waste of time at first, but I guess people need to take a break once in a while!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’d rather... be working... on the time leap machine...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“This... just proves... that I belong... indoors...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You two are all worn out! Ehehe!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Come on, guys! Stamina is the key to survival!”[%p]
Kurisu and Daru are exhausted, while Suzuha and Mayuri are still going strong.[%p]
I already know the distance between Akiba and Ariake, so I’m able to pace myself in order to conserve energy.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“W-water! Where’s a vending machine!? I could kill for a glass of water!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry, but there’s no convenience store until we cross another bridge after this one. Tough it out.”[%p]
I reply mechanically.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Y-you serious? I can’t, it’s impossible...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow, Okarin! You really know the area! Have you been here before?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yeah. Many times.”[%p]
What cycle is this? My tenth?[%p]
It must be more than that by now.[%p]
I’m still repeating the same two days.[%p]
Moeka’s attack? Mayuri’s death?[%p]
Those things will never, ever happen.[%p]
Today, once again, we’re off on an adventure.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Big Sight’s straight ahead. It shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes to get there.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Let’s take a break first...”[%p]
Daru has used up the last of his strength. While still on his bike, he rests his body against the guardrail separating us from the road.[%p]
I turn and pull up next to Daru’s bike.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not sa--”[%p]
I swallow my words.[%p]
Thoughts too dark to be my own suddenly slip into mind.[%p]
What will happen... if I don’t pull Daru back?[%p]
Will the truck catch on Daru’s fat? Will it send him flying like a rag doll? Will it take off his head? Will blood spray from the stump like a crimson fountain?[%p]
Will the girls scream, I wonder?[%p]
Let’s find out.[%p]
What difference does it make if Daru dies? I can just time leap again, can’t I?[%p]
Go back to the start of the loop, and Daru will be as good as new.[%p]
Besides, everyone needs a little spice in their life.[%p]
For these two days, I am God.[%p]
I choose who lives and who--[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whoa!”[%p]
The sound of a horn blasts my eardrums.[%p]
Daru jerks back from the guardrail.[%p]
A split second later, the truck howls past.[%p]
Daru loses his balance and falls on his butt.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Th-that was close!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, are you okay?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Are you hurt?”[%p]
Kurisu and Suzuha get off their bicycles and help Daru up.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That truck was mean!”[%p]
The truck has already crossed the intersection after the bridge. We watch it drive away.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Man, what a shock. What was with that guy!? Crazy drivers. I should’ve checked the number! Then I could be like ’Reported!’”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Nothing actually happened, so there’s not much point in reporting it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Everyone’s fussing over Daru.[%p]
I stand a few steps away, staring at my hands.[%p]
I’m glad it ended as something to laugh about... but what was I thinking just now?[%p]
I began this loop so that no one would be hurt.[%p]
So that Mayuri would live, and Suzuha would never go back in time.[%p]
Yet just now... I was ready to watch Daru die. [%p]
Some part of me wanted it to happen.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Okabe Rintaro?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“!?”[%p]
I cower in reflex upon hearing my name.[%p]
Suzuha is staring at me. There are questions in her eyes.[%p]
She can’t have heard my dark thoughts just now.[%p]
And yet, I feel like she can see right through me.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...You look pale.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What’s wrong, Okarin? I’m the one who should be shaking!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“R-right...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I was just imagining what would happen if I lost my super hacka. The lab can’t survive without you!”[%p]
I use a purposefully extravagant tone to cover up my guilty thoughts, and start pedaling.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Break’s over! Let’s go!”[%p]
I am this world’s observer.[%p]
Nothing can escape my subjectivity.[%p]
Everything and everyone exists as I will it.[%p]
Mayuri. Kurisu. Daru. Even Suzuha.[%p]
Here, we can live in peace and harmony.[%p]
None of us need ever face death.[%p]
A 48-hour eternity.[%p]
I am the creator of this paradise.[%p]
And so, I know.[%p]
Tomorrow will be another wonderful day.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Holy Land, I have returned!”[%p]
Daru, his vigor restored, greets Big Sight with his arms spread wide.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wow... I’ve never seen it this empty...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Look at all that space. It’s hard to believe they fill this whole area during ComiMa.”[%p]
In the emptiness, it is easy to see how truly majestic Big Sight is.[%p]
At ComiMa, when you’re wading through a sea of people, it’s just another big building.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey! Mayushii’s hungry!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Isn’t there a restaurant nearby? Let’s take a break.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I can’t believe we have to bike all the way back. What a nightmare...”[%p]
The three of them go searching for the family restaurant.[%p]
Suzuha is still gazing at Big Sight.[%p]
My eyes roam her body.[%p]
Those tight legs.[%p]
That slender body.[%p]
Her clothes accentuate all her fine curves.[%p]
Her breasts are surprisingly large.[%p]
Something stirs in my heart.[%p]
Hot and heavy, like thick lava.[%p]
It whispers to me words like poison.[%p]
What if...[%p]
What if I lure her into a dark corner and have my way with her? What then?[%p]
Getting her alone would be simple enough.[%p]
All I have to do is offer information on her father and she’ll follow me anywhere.[%p]
To make matters easier, no Amane Suzuha exists in present-day Japan.[%p]
No documents proving Japanese citizenship. Not even a birth certificate.[%p]
It’s only natural. She won’t be born for another seven years.[%p]
So even if she runs to the police, nobody will believe a word she says.[%p]
I imagine she’ll put up a fight. She was a member of the Resistance in her time, and I know she’s stronger than she looks.[%p]
But she’s still just a girl. It may take some doing, but I’ll have my way with her in the end.[%p]
Another me -- Hououin Kyouma, perhaps? -- is whispering inside my head.[%p]
“You want a woman, don’t you?” it says. “Of course you do. It’s [color index="A0140000"]instinct[color index="800000"].”[%p]
“So what if she’s Daru’s daughter? So what if she’s on a mission to save the future?”[%p]
[margin top="190"][center]Forget about that.[%p]
[margin top="38"][center]She’s a fine woman. That’s all.[%e]
[margin top="190"][center]You’re not a saint, Okabe Rintaro.[%p]
[margin top="38"][center]What was it you call yourself again?[%p]
[margin top="38"][center]That’s right, an insane mad scientist.[%p]
[margin top="38"][center]If you’re really insane, then let’s see you snap.[%e]
[margin top="190"][center]Remember. You have the power of a god.[%p]
[margin top="38"][center]You can rape her, and then undo it with the Time Leap Machine.[%e]
[margin top="76"][center]And hey, while you’re at it, why not taste the same girl’s[linebreak][center]virginity[linebreak][center]over and over again?[%p]
[margin top="38"][center]Wouldn’t that be something? All those[linebreak][center]VIRGINS ONLY freaks would kill to be you.[%e]
[margin top="114"][margin left="32"]Hell, why stop at rape?[%p]
[margin top="76"][margin left="112"]Think of what ELSE you can do with the Time Leap [margin left="112"]Machine.[%e]
Murder. Steal. Kidnap. Destroy.[%p]
[margin top="152"][center]Is that the best you can do, Okabe Rintaro?[%p]
[margin top="38"][center]Is that really all the evil in your heart?[%p]
[margin top="38"][center]Well, I guess we’re only human after all.[%e]
[margin top="190"][center]Think about it, Okabe Rintaro.[%p]
[margin top="38"][center]Sure, you wanted this loop, but repeat the same two days forever?[linebreak][center]Sounds like torture to me.[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]Aren’t you tired of it already?[%e]
[margin top="228"][center]These two days should be your paradise.[linebreak][center]Forget about petty laws and morals.[%e]
[margin top="190"][center]You’re a hunter.[%p]
[margin top="38"][center]Taboos mean nothing to you. Hunt your prey and eat your fill.[%e]
The voice is right.[%p]
I am the observer. I am God.[%p]
I can do anything.[%p]
[margin top="38"][margin left="32"]Do her.[font size="1000"][%p]
[margin top="76"][margin left="560"][center][font size="1308"][color index="A0390000"]Kill her.[font size="1000"][color index="800000"][%p]
[margin top="76"][margin left="180"][center][font size="1770"][color index="A0390000"]Rape her.[font size="1000"][color index="800000"][%e]
No one can judge me in this closed loop of time.[%p]
[margin top="38"][margin left="50"]Forget your morals.[font size="1000"][%p]
[margin top="76"][margin left="560"][center]Trust your primal urges.[font size="1000"][%p]
[margin top="76"][margin left="140"][center]Follow your instincts.[font size="1000"][%e]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gah...”[%p]
I cover my ears and avert my eyes from Suzuha.[%p]
Bzzz. zzz. zzz. zzz.[%p]
My ears are ringing.[%p]
Someone is trying to crush my soul, projecting thoughts not my own onto the screen of my heart.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Okabe Rintaro?”[%p]
Suddenly, Suzuha grabs me by the shoulders and peers into my face.[%p]
The warmth from her hands makes the buzzing grow louder.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You really are sick, aren’t you? Want to sit down?”[%p]
I’m afraid to look at Suzuha with these dark feelings clogging my mind.[%p]
I shake her off and flee towards Big Sight.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Okabe Rintaro! Where are you going!?”[%p]
I need to get away from Suzuha. If I don’t, I might give into the urge.[%p]
I stare at my hands.[%p]
Clench. Open. Clench. Open.[%p]
Repeat. Repeat.[%p]
My hands still move.[%p]
Just as I expect them to.[%p]
Just as I order them to.[%p]
But.[%p]
Those dark impulses.[%p]
The devil’s whispers.[%p]
How can I explain those?[%p]
What the hell was that?[%p]
What’s happening to me?[%p]
I start to tremble.[%p]
My teeth chatter.[%p]
The sun’s hot enough to burn my skin, but I feel cold.[%p]
I’m afraid of myself.[%p]
I’m... still okay, aren’t I?[%p]
I am Hououin Kyouma. Okabe Rintaro.[%p]
The insane mad scientist with a fetish for science and chaos.[%p]
See? I still know who I am.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Still?”[%p]
What is that supposed to mean?[%p]
Will I eventually lose control of myself?[%p]
Am I going to break?[%p]
Like a Moebius Strip, the same two days go round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round.[%p]
But today, I failed to keep them the same.[%p]
My feelings became twisted.[%p]
Today on Harumi Bridge, I didn’t just hesitate to save Daru. I nearly yielded to my dark emotions.[%p]
Dark emotions.[%p]
Dark impulses.[%p]
Emotions seeping with venom.[%p]
I listened to their poisonous, disgusting whispers.[%p]
And I was almost drawn in.[%p]
There’s no denying it.[%p]
Worse, that was but a taste of what might lurk inside my heart.[%p]
If those emotions attack me again, this time crashing over me like a tsunami...[%p]
Will I be able to control myself?[%p]
Mayuri.[%p]
Kurisu.[%p]
Daru.[%p]
...Suzuha.[%p]
Will I be able to keep myself from hurting them, no matter what?[%p]
Will I be able to keep everyone safe in this loop I made for Mayuri and Suzuha’s sake?[%p]
Do I really have such strength?[%p]
I don’t know.[%p]
That answer is hardly reassuring.[%p]
But for now, it’s the only answer I’ve got.[%p]
This endless loop is the world I wished for.[%p]
I can only protect this world. Only I can protect this world.[%p]
I pray that those impulses were just a fluke, that they’ll never resurface again.[%p]
I ask only that tomorrow be peaceful.[%p]
The wind caresses my cheek.[%p]
I push down on the pedals and begin the ascent up Harumi Bridge.[%p]
The spokes revolve rhythmically, reflecting the sunlight.[%p]
Sweat oozes out of every pore, but it’s not unpleasant.[%p]
It feels good, healthy, like running around the school field as a child.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The weather’s so nice!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whew, hee, why did I have to come along?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Same... here... haah, whew... the wind’s... too strong...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’re a little chubby, Daru-kun. I think you need to exercise more!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Fat neckbeard master race...”[%p]
Leading the way at a terrific pace is Suzuha on her trusty mountain bike.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What a view!”[%p]
From here, you can see across Tokyo Bay, all the way to Rainbow Bridge in the distance.[%p]
Except for Suzuha, we’re all using rent-a-cycles.[%p]
I wanted a change of pace from the search for the unfindable pin, so I proposed this cycling expedition.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I thought this trip would be a waste of time at first, but I guess people need to take a break once in a while, huh?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’d rather... be working... on the time leap machine...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“This... just proves... that I belong... indoors...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You two are all worn out! Ehehe!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Come on, guys! Stamina is the key to survival!”[%p]
Kurisu and Daru are exhausted, while Suzuha and Mayuri are still going strong.[%p]
I already know the distance between Akiba and Ariake, so I’m able to pace myself in order to conserve energy.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“W-water! Where’s a vending machine!? I could kill for a glass of water!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Then do it.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh?”[%p]
Everyone turns to look at me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Do it. Kill someone.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“W-why so serious, man?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Come on, what are you waiting for? If you want to do it, then do it.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, Okabe. What’s gotten into you?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin, you shouldn’t say things like that.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What’s up with you, man?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nothing.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s a convenience store once we pass two bridges. Tough it out.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Geh, really? That’s farther than I thought...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Hundreds of days have passed since this began. Maybe thousands. How many cycles has it been?[%p]
I’ve repeated this loop so many times that I’ve grown tired of keeping track.[%p]
I can barely remember the reason I started.[%p]
The days go by, like tearing pages from a calendar.[%p]
Everyone says the same things. Everyone responds in the same way. I’ve noticed my biorhythms seem a bit off, but aside from that, every day is the same.[%p]
Same, same, same, same, same, same, same, same.[%p]
Yes, subtle deviations occur.[%p]
But it’s all within acceptable limits. In the end, the result is always the same.[%p]
Everything that happens is insignificant. Meaningless. Pointless.[%p]
I’m the only one still living in this loop.[%p]
Everyone else is just being kept alive.[%p]
By me.[%p]
We’re just spinning our wheels in a dead world.[%p]
My soul died some cycles back. I don’t remember.[%p]
This isn’t life.[%p]
Mayuri’s death?[%p]
Moeka’s raid?[%p]
Suzuha’s time travel?[%p]
I may have cared about those things once.[%p]
Not anymore.[%p]
When did I stop caring?[%p]
When did I become a machine, looping and looping for all eternity?[%p]
Nothing matters.[%p]
When these two days are over, they will start again. Everything will be reset. I will reset it myself.[%p]
Then I guess it’s pointless to worry.[%p]
Ridiculous.[%p]
How many times have I repeated this loop?[%p]
My senses have gone dull. It’s getting harder to respond to the things I see and hear.[%p]
I feel detached. Like I’m isolated inside a thin membrane.[%p]
And I’ve already gotten used to it.[%p]
I don’t find it inconvenient anymore.[%p]
I simply adapted.[%p]
I simply optimized.[%p]
To this far too narrow world.[%p]
To this far too gentle world.[%p]
Why shouldn’t I adapt?[%p]
This is my world.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Haah... I quit cycling!”[%p]
Daru has used up the last of his strength. While still on his bike, he rests his body against the guardrail separating us from the road.[%p]
I stop my bicycle and watch impassively.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Whoa!”[%p]
The horn blares.[%p]
Daru jerks away from the rail.[%p]
A split second later, the truck howls past.[%p]
Daru loses his balance and falls on his butt.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Th-that was close!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, are you okay?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Are you hurt?”[%p]
Kurisu and Suzuha get off their bicycles and help Daru up.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That truck was mean!”[%p]
The truck has already crossed the intersection after the bridge. We watch it drive away.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Man, what a shock. What was with that guy!? Crazy drivers. I should’ve checked the number! Then I could be like ’Reported!’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So report him.”[%p]
The truck’s number smoothly rolls off my tongue.[%p]
I’ve seen it so many times it’s like a brand on my brain.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There, now you know. Report him.”[%p]
I hold my phone out.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...Did I do something, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You said you wanted to report him, so I’m giving you the opportunity.”[%p]
My tone is flat. I’m just saying whatever comes to mind.[%p]
It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I agree that Hashida could be a little less lazy, but you’re going way too far, Okabe.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Shut up, you class rep wannabe.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wh, what?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“No fighting, guys! Daru-kun’s okay, so let’s be happy, okay?”[%p]
I ignore Mayuri and shove my phone at Daru.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re not going to report him?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“W-well, I guess I’ll let him off the hook this time.”[%p]
I sigh and put away my phone.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha is staring at me again.[%p]
She looks like she wants to say something.[%p]
But who cares what she thinks? I feel nothing.[%p]
