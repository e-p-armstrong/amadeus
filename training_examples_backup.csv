Let’s say we wanted to make a machine that could physically transport people through time. What would we need? The best candidates for this are cosmic strings and wormholes. A cosmic string is a string-shaped ’crevice’ with extreme mass. The crevice is about as wide as an elementary particle, and at least as long as the diameter of a galaxy. It has immense mass, so it distorts space-time. If you were to travel through that distortion, you could make a full circle around the string in less than 360 degrees. In short, you can do something resembling a warp. This is called a space-time angular deficit. When you pass through an area of angular deficit, transit time becomes zero. Now we apply this to a cosmic string moving at near-light speed. According to the special theory of relativity, time will flow slower for the cosmic string in relation to its surroundings. Therefore, passing through the area of angular deficit would cause the transit time to become negative instead of zero. In other words, you will arrive in the past after transit. If you use two cosmic strings, you can do a space deficit jump. If you loop back to your original location, you can return to the same time you started revolving. And that, roughly speaking, is time travel by means of cosmic strings. By the way, just so nobody misunderstands, cosmic strings are not the same as superstrings. Now then, you need three things in order to travel to the past with cosmic strings. First. The cosmic strings themselves. Two strings, to be exact. By the way, they are hypothesized to exist only where the universe was first formed, so they might be a little hard to find. Second. You would need the energy required to make them move them at near-light speed. How much energy do you think you’d need to accelerate something as long as the Milky Way to near the speed of light? I’m pretty sure it’s a little more than 1. 21 jigowatts.')]"
"[('Rintaro', 'It’s like a shortcut through space... right?'), ('Kurisu', 'Yes, that’s correct. There are two wormholes joined by a tunnel. No matter how far away the wormholes are, transit time through the tunnel is zero. But oh no, there’s a problem. The wormhole tunnel suffers from super gravity, and collapses as soon as it opens. So we need something to negate the effect of gravity. So-called ’exotic matter’. A substance with negative mass which repulses other matter. Say that the wormhole tunnel is being squished by an invisible fist. In order to pass through, you need something that could oppose my fist’s ’grasping force’ so that I can’t squish anymore. If you stabilize the tunnel with exotic matter injection, instantaneous travel between wormholes becomes possible. To travel through time, however, takes a little more effort. For example, let’s say there’s a wormhole entrance here in Akihabara, and the exit is in Los Angeles. First, we send the wormhole in LA all the way to the end of the universe at near the speed of light. And once it’s there, we yank it back to LA. According to the special theory of relativity, time slows down for objects moving at the speed of light. Meaning the hole that returned to LA would be further in the past than the Akihabara hole. So now, if Hououin-san jumped into the wormhole, he’d arrive in LA several years before he left. However, this still can’t be called true time travel. It only seems that way. This is called the Urashima effect. The important part is to return to Akihabara from LA through the wormhole once more. Since the transit time is zero...

And hardwiring each of them to the magnetron’s cathode and anode.'), ('Kurisu', 'Both devices use electromagnetic waves. I’m not a specialist, though, so I can’t examine the extent or magnitude of the influence that fusion has... But hypothetically, if the cellphone were to become a stepping stone, scattering the military-grade electromagnetic waves over a vast range of hundreds of kilometers-- Then not just Akihabara, but all of Tokyo would turn into the inside of a microwave oven. Taking into account slight variance due to body weight, the average time until death for the people inside would be-- Three minutes.'), ('Mayuri', 'Ehh!?'), ('Itaru', 'Seriously? Then the PhoneWave’s a weapon of mass destruction, isn’t it!?'), ('Kurisu', 'Let me tell you what happens inside the PhoneWave. The air inside the oven is full of invisible hydrogen atoms. First, it bombards the atoms with microwaves to increase their energy potential. This is the normal function of a microwave oven. But when you add the electromagnetic waves from the phone... The harmonics trigger a chain reaction. The particles collide repeatedly at near light-speed, gaining mass and energy each time. In other words, it becomes a sort of particle accelerator.'), ('Rintaro', 'A particle accelerator!?

By freak coincidence, the PhoneWave is able to produce ring singularities, much like John Titor’s time machine. Through the ring singularity, we are able to send up to 36 bytes of data to the past. The signal can only be received by phones. While that does limit the range of effect, it also removes an element of uncertainty from the equation. Unlike D-Mails, memory data is sent in the form of a phone call, so we will be using a phone number, not an email address, to set the destination. The ring singularity is made naked and stable by a device known as a lifter. In our case, that’s the 42-inch CRT downstairs. The PhoneWave now has headgear attached. This headgear records the nerve impulses in the temporal lobe of the brain -- specifically, the CA3 region of the hippocampus, where memories are stored.

Though it may be trendy, especially in Akiba, for young men to wear baggy clothes, it looks sloppy, so it’s not good. On the first date, conversation tends to break due to mutual nervousness. What’s important is to play ’conversation catch’. One-sided conversations aren’t fun for the other side. Girls especially like to talk, so the guy should try to keep the conversation going. Not just by listening. Throwing in appropriate responses is also necessary. Responsiveness gives the girl the impression that you’re really listening to her.
